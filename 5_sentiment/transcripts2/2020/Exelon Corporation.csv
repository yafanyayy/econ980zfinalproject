I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor, and we delivered financially. 
As you can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share, above our revised guidance range and the midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call, I want to address the operational details as we go forward. 
Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion  in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. 
We had a productive year on the regulatory front. [indiscernible] yield is first on a regular rate case, and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multi-year rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC and ComEd's formula rate provided the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago. 
On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court [indiscernible] New York State and Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. 
We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019 to grow the dividend by 11,000 more than in 2018. During national volunteer week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. 
We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Diversity, Inc. and The Human Rights Rights Campaign. Our total supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnership with local businesses by offering development programs. 
We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels, delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we've we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorneys' Office in Northern Illinois. As we've said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards. 
At the end of the [indiscernible], our commitments for 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities that is at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively.  2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side,  and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30 -- 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs, while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions. 
Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tool tools, including alternate rate making such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. 
Turning to Slide 8. FERC's recent order on PJM capacity, the governors in Illinois, Maryland and Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM minimum offer price rule, or MOPR, will result in clean resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market, only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states as well as many others oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean. 
On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO, achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile by 0.01 points. 
Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. 
Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned. 
Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers, where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contracts terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials."

For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a",1592,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. 
Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original midpoint. 
Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E as well as higher distribution revenues of the PG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's ROE. 
ExGen earned $1.31 per share exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development or R&D tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Hamley station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments. 
Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time. And we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. 
On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities. 
Since the PHI merger in [ 2018,  ] we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These to support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. 
Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see build inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly $0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability. 
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. 
So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $[ 400 ] million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. 
We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021. We're taking cross commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021. 
Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021, given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities, given their growing capital needs. 
Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel cost looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen, while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. 
Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. 
Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year, we will be accessing the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this, in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities less holdco is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on Slide 55. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities, while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned. 
At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs our states' energy policy goals. And we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives, which was in-flight in several states.

We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our 0 emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there, while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment grade metrics -- strong investment grade metrics, and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020.

As you know, there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. 
So we, of course, agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know, is in March to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. 
And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. Forecast no time line in which to ask -- to act on request for rehearing. But I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean, they laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM. I see no future where they change their mind on that policy. And I think, therefore, the states are right and looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in RPM."

So as we work with stakeholders, explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification, and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable, like baseload nuclear, there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals. And that's going to be a critical part going forward. 
We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going to go backwards that -- with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an industry, and we're trying to do that. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states not only financially but environmentally backwards."

I mean, it's exactly these state programs that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. 
Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner estimated that it's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool.

Your second question on the offset set at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use 21 is an example where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However, that's a price at a common trading point.

I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor, and we delivered financially.
You can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share, above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward.
Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. 
We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case, and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago.
On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York Supreme Court -- Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program, and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. 
We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019 . That's 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. 
We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels, delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards. At the end of [indiscernible] our commitments for 2020.
Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively.  2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions.
Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making, such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. 
Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The governors in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, will result in clean resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states, as well as many others, oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.
On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. 
Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7%, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned.
Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share, delivering 154 terawatt-hours of electricity and 67 terawatt-hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity.
And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials."

Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a G",1590,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share, net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E, as well as higher distribution revenues of the PG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development, or R&D, tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time, and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. 
On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities.
Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.
Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility, less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly $0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. 
So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. 
We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 when taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.
Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4x debt to EBITDA and 1.9x debt to EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year, we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this, in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We  have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities, less holdco, is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 55. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

This is key to who we are. 
Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023, rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics, and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon. 
Operator, we can now open the call to questions."

As you know, there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers, and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. So we, of course, agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know, is in March, to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. 
And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM.

The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals, and that's going to be a critical part going forward. 
We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an industry, and we're trying to do that. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful.

I mean it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. 
Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other independent analyses have gone there, too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact."

Just in terms of the guidance, I know you mentioned the AFUDC and the reconciliation of the CapEx and rate base. Can we talk about the earnings? Obviously, rate base, unchanged; EPS guidance, higher. Is that principally due to some of these changes in AFUDC that isn't formally reflected in that rate base and obviously is reflected in that Capex? Or are there other changes? Obviously, the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in '20 and 21 onwards has shifted a little bit as well but just wanted to clarify that. 
And then also on ExGen, similar dynamic around what's causing the offset versus the open margin. I think you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially. Just want to elaborate quickly on that as well as maybe the tax piece for ExGen year-over-year."

On your first question, remember, we're giving you guidance for the combined EU and holdco, so there's a couple of variables, even though we're investing CapEx and rate bases are rising. When you look at it, the interest rate -- the interest expense at corporate is projected lower, which drives EPS as one variable that's positive to the earnings. We are -- when you look at these projects, right, you could still see there is additional CapEx growth, and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value. 
Your second question on the offsets at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use '21 as an example, where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However, that's a price at a common trading point. When you look at the values associated back to where the generator busbars are, for example, those prices move every day as well, and there were some offsets associated with that. So that got us down to flat."

There's adequate capacity in -- within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action, which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025 before you'd be able to enact, and that's a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point. So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year, is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others. It actually, as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's -- as drafted or inputted previously, there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time, and there's discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently. And we hope that PJM respects the states' needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire."

I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor, and we delivered financially.
You can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share, above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward.
Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. 
We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case, and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago.
On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York State Supreme Court -- Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program, and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. 
We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019 . That's 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. 
We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels, delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards. At the end of [indiscernible] our commitments for 2020.
Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively.  2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions.
Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making, such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. 
Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The governors in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, will result in clean right resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states as well as many others, oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.
On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. 
Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7%, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned.
Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share, delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity.
And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials."

Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share, net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E as well as higher distribution revenues of the BG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development, or R&D, tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time, and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. 
On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities.
Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.
Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility, less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly $0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. 
So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. 
We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 by taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.
Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4x debt to EBITDA and 1.9x debt to EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year, we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this is in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities, less holdco, is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 55. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals, and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve. This is key to who we are. 
Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023, rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics, and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon.

As you know, there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers, and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction.

So we, of course, agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know, is in March, to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. 
And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they've laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM.

I think over the last 2 to 3 years, you've seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it's contributing to a cleaner environment, low carbon and also other emitting gases. So as we work with stakeholders, explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable, like baseload nuclear, there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals, and that's going to be a critical part going forward. 
We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an industry, and we're trying to do that. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states, not only financially, but environmentally backwards."

But we've shut down Oyster Creek, gone into decommissioning with a decommissioning company. TMI is off. There was no path for financial stability. And as I've said in the past, we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments, and the negative cash flow assets will only send the fleet backwards, and our goals on strong investment-grade will allow us to maintain our commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt. So we'll work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it, and we're not going to speculate until we have no longer have a path to profitability for the assets."

I mean it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. 
Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other independent analyses have gone there, too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact."

On your first question, remember, we're giving you guidance for the combined EU and holdco, so there's a couple of variables, even though we're investing CapEx and rate bases are rising. When you look at it, the interest rate -- the interest expense at corporate is projected lower, which drives EPS as one variable that's positive to the earnings. We are -- when you look at these projects, right, you could still see there is additional CapEx growth, and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value. 
Your second question on the offsets at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use '21 as an example, where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However, that's a price at a common trading point. When you look at the values associated back to where the generator busbars are, for example, those prices move every day as well, and there were some offsets associated with that. So that got us down to flat."

There's adequate capacity in -- within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action, which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025 before you'd be able to enact, and that's a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point. So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year, is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others. It actually, as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's -- as drafted or inputted previously, there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time, and there's discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently.

I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor, and we delivered financially.
You can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share, above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward.
Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. 
We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case, and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago.
On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York State Supreme Court -- Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program, and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. 
We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019 . That's 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. 
We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels, delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards. At the end of [indiscernible] our commitments for 2020.
Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively. 2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions.
Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making, such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. 
Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The governors in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, will result in clean right resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states as well as many others, oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.
On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. 
Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7%, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned.
Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share, delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity.
And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials."

For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a G",1591,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share, net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E as well as higher distribution revenues of the BG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development, or R&D, tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time, and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. 
On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities.
Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.
Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility, less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly $0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. 
So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. 
We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 by taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.
Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4x debt to EBITDA and 1.9x debt to EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year, we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this is in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities, less holdco, is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 55. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals, and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve. This is key to who we are. 
Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023, rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics, and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon.

I can take that question. I'll start with auction timing. As you know, there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers, and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. So we, of course, agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know, is in March, to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. 
And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they've laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM. I see no future where they change their mind on that policy, and I think, therefore, the states are right in looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in RPM."

I can jump in on the -- on your point about having a longer-term framework, which is exactly the point of the legislation that's pending in Illinois. And the idea of using the Fixed Resource Requirement provision in the PJM tariff or the FRR provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide, for example, for renewables that may want to have contracts of differing lengths exactly that flexibility for them to have those contracts. And likewise, for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to differentiate when they're procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources. And having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer-term basis is one of the key benefits of the FRR strategy."

I think over the last 2 to 3 years, you've seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it's contributing to a cleaner environment, low carbon and also other emitting gases. So as we work with stakeholders, explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable, like baseload nuclear, there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals, and that's going to be a critical part going forward. 
We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an industry, and we're trying to do that. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states, not only financially, but environmentally backwards."

I mean it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. 
Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other independent analyses have gone there, too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact."

We are -- when you look at these projects, right, you could still see there is additional CapEx growth, and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value. 
Your second question on the offsets at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use '21 as an example, where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However, that's a price at a common trading point.

So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year, is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others. It actually, as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's -- as drafted or inputted previously, there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system.

I'm going to start on Slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remain focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially.
You can read the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share, above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward.
Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million -- which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system, resulting in the best ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities. 
We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case, and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with a multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third rate decrease in 5 years, helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago.
On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York State Supreme Court -- Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program, and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring. Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation, setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January. 
We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019 . That's 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees, which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint. We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend. Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. 
We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row. We are focused on operating at world-class levels, delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you, our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities. However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges, including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously. The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that, going forward, we operate at the highest possible standards. At the end of [indiscernible] our commitments for 2020.
Turning to Slide 6. We're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize our electric and gas systems. We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities, Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities and 2% to 7% below the national average. These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments. Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE, respectively. 2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE. On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions.
Moving to Slide 7. Our states are focused on ensuring the electric and gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more -- and resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change. We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making, such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs. 
Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The governors in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy, and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other. Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, will result in clean right resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy. Our states as well as many others, oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.
On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE, ComEd and PECO achieving top decile, and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last 3 years, missing first quartile by 0.01 points. Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to 8 in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration, and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration. 
Turning to generation on Slide 10. Our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019, providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the United States. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7%, our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019. Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9%, and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned.
Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share, delivering 154 terawatt hours of electricity and 67 terawatt hours more than our nearest competitor. Our retail operating metrics remain strong: 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than 6 years and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins. Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity.
And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials."

Today, I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2020 guidance. Starting with Slide 11. We had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year, we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original midpoint. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share, net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E as well as higher distribution revenues of the BG&E. These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share. ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development, or R&D, tax benefit for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years. We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.
Moving to Slide 12. The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%. As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities and expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time, and we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities. 
On Slide 13, we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year, we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion in our utilities and a total of $26 billion over the next 4 years. These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion since last year's fourth quarter call. As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities.
Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities. Over the next 4 years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.
Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility, starting on Slide 23. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility, less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly $0.05 compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry-leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.
Before discussing our gross margin update on Slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021. 
So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or '21 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in '20 and '21, respectively, due to declining power prices across most regions, offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020. 
We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 by taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call last year, our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense, it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.
Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs. Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon. We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.
Moving to Slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4x debt to EBITDA and 1.9x debt to EBITDA when excluding nonrecourse debt. This year, we will be active in the capital markets as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this is in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019. 
Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases. We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases, most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities, less holdco, is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share. The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix, starting on Slide 55. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments, delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned. At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals, and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve.

Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023, rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation. We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics, and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon.

As you know, there's a large group of stakeholders, including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers, and most importantly, the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills. So we, of course, agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort, which, as you know, is in March, to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. 
And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they've laid out in an order in ISO New England 3 years ago that MOPR is their standard solution, and they have carried that through to PJM.

So as we work with stakeholders, explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable, like baseload nuclear, there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that. The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals, and that's going to be a critical part going forward. 
We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables, and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission. So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company but an industry, and we're trying to do that. 
The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses, and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states. We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants, and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states, not only financially, but environmentally backwards."

I mean it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies. 
Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program, they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool.

So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value. 
Your second question on the offsets at generation, it's -- when you look at the prices falling, use '21 as an example, where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However, that's a price at a common trading point.

There's adequate capacity in -- within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action, which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025 before you'd be able to enact, and that's a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point. So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year, is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others. It actually, as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's -- as drafted or inputted previously, there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time, and there's discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently. And we hope that PJM respects the states' needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire."

We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark. 
We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue. Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy Legislation are -- which is very critical right now, are meeting. The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we'll work and continue to work on that through May. 
Our #1 focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees. Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical in as many as possible of working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees in another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults. So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system in the power plants, we're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening. We have not laid off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic. 
We've done a couple of things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID, plus 25 contractors. 82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we're continuing to focus on the health and safety and the well-being. We fully -- we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them from the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees are supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job, one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running. 
A big part -- on Slide 4, you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you've heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March [ in ] offer to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability to -- for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide. 
We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that. But at the core of everything, after safety in the community is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power health care providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000 customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power. 
On the power side, the nuclear group has completed 7 of 8 refueling outages, all better than planned. There's 1 refueling outage left to go that we'll be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on the Ganey Station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's world-class. It's been world-class performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying times, we've only had 25 employees that have -- excuse me, 29, including contractors, 25 employees have been infected with the COVID virus, and all but 4 have returned to work. So the work that we're doing with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are needed has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues. 
So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. Starting with Slide 10. We earned",1982,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. 
Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were 5 to 7 degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation and our nondecoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger. 
Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility. 
ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and Fitzpatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains. 
Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically, we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact. Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talk to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. 
We've taken a cautious view of the world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range. We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate. 
I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated forecast. 
At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our nondecoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad -- higher bad debt. 
At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes at our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad-debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad-debt mechanisms, recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. 
On Slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms. 
Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the constellation business are like those of a nondecoupled utility. Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels. In retail, constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial. And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed-price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last 9 months of the year, we assume constellation load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%. 
I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19. So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first, margin; second, commodity value; and third through collection of fixed price charges. We are seeing the impacts of lower load on [ easing ] the current environment. When load is lower, constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price, creating a gap in revenues. 
Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis. So when the customer consumes less, we under collect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are -- due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall. 
These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the pandemic. 
In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage. 
Looking to the future, the constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load. In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. 
Finally, across -- finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We've [ entered ] $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of the year. During the quarter, we expect -- we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business, respectively. In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million, primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and '21. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in '20 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx. 
Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market in a $900 million [ June ] holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs. 
We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021, as some of the cash timing issues that the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind. If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris."

We have found ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done. We'll continue to look for ways we can increase profitability and cash flow through the next 3 quarters. The impact on the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy remains strong. Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next 4 years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our utility operations are best-in-class. First quartile -- first quarter performance in reliability and customer satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest in the nation. We are delivering 1 out of every 9 megawatts of clean energy in a significant portion of the nation's clean energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations. 
If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged. We're focused on our growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3 rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS and growth rates if that rate was to stay this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down ExGen debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of the Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets and maximizing their value through constellation. We will sustain a strong investment-grade credit rating metrics throughout this period. 
Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Thank you."

Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker.

It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year. And that could be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue.

And if the economy continues to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future, the plans can be adjusted. But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting. We plan on continuing to do the much-needed reliability and efficiency modifications and prepare the system for the onset of much more distributed and renewable energy coming on.

There could be some suppliers that would need to look over their books. We've talked about our strategy before will stay the same, which is we would be looking to buy things, buy books of business that we could easily fit into our platform.

The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact. And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance for this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is say, well, if any -- if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to-go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year. 
For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more -- a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in. We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which those are impacted by how much those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels.

We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark. 
We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue. 
Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation are -- which is very critical right now, are meeting. The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we'll work and continue to work on that through May. 
Our #1 focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees. Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical in as many as possible working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults. So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system in the power plants. We're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening. We have not laid off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic. 
We've done a couple of things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID, plus 25 contractors. 82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we're continuing to focus on the health and safety and the well-being. We fully -- we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them for the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees are supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running. 
A big part -- on Slide 4, you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you've heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March and offered to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability to -- for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide. 
We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that. 
But at the core of everything, after safety in the community, is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, health care providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization, continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000 customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power. 
On the power side, the nuclear group has completed 7 of 8 refueling outages, all better than planned. There's 1 refueling outage left to go that we'll be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on the [ Ginna ] station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's world-class -- it's been world-class performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying times, we've only had 25 employees that have -- excuse me, 29 including contractors, 25 employees have been infected with the COVID virus, and all but 4 have returned to work. So the work that we're doing with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are needed has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues. 
So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. Starting with Slide 10. We earned",1975,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. 
Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were 5 to 7 degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation and our non-decoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger. 
Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility. 
ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains. 
Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically, we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact. 
Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talked to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. We've taken a cautious view of the world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range. We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate. 
I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated forecast. 
At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad -- higher bad debt. 
At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes at our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad debt mechanisms -- recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. On Slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms. 
Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility. Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels. In retail, Constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial. And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last 9 months of the year, we assume Constellation load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%. 
I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19. So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first, margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges. We are seeing the impacts of lower load on these in the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price, creating a gap in revenues. Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis. So when the customer consumes less, we undercollect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall. 
These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the pandemic. 
In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage. 
Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial and industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load. In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. Finally, across -- finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We then are $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of the year. During the quarter, we expect -- we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business, respectively. In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million, primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and '21. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in '20 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx. 
Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market and a $900 million June holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs. 
We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021, as some of the cash timing issues at the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind. If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris."

We have found ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done. We'll continue to look for ways we can increase profitability and cash flow through the next 3 quarters. The impact on the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy remains strong. Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next 4 years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our utility operations are best-in-class. First quartile -- first quarter performance in reliability and customer satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest in the nation. We are delivering 1 out of every 9 megawatts of clean energy in a significant portion of the nation's clean energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations. 
If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged. We're focused on our growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS and growth rates if that rate was to stay this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down ExGen debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of the Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets and maximizing their value through constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit rating metrics throughout this period. 
Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Thank you."

Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker. They could call a session after May 31 or the Governor himself could call a special session under the constitution. So we're glad to see that there has been guidance provided.

It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year. And that could be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the stakeholders and we'll continue to push on that."

So as you can imagine, as you would expect, we look at multiple scenarios. And if the economy continues to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future, the plans can be adjusted. But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting. We plan on continuing to do the much-needed reliability and efficiency modifications and prepare the system for the onset of much more distributed and renewable energy coming on. It won't be able to happen if we don't make the investments and facilitate it. If we see a day that we're not getting that return or don't see a path to go back, I mean, we haven't seen that day, and we haven't seen that in the near future.

The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact. And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance for this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is, say, well, if any -- if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year. 
For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more -- a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in. We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which loads are impacted by how much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels. And the $50 million we've included is a good estimate."

We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark. 
We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue. 
Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation are -- which is very critical right now, are meeting. The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we'll work and continue to work on that through May. 
Our #1 focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees. Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical and as many as possible working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults. So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system and the power plants. We're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening. We have not laid off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic. 
We've done a couple of things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID, plus 25 contractors. 82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we're continuing to focus on the health and safety and the well-being. We fully -- we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them for the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees or supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running. 
A big part -- on Slide 4 (sic) [Slide 8], you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you've heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March and offered to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability to -- for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide. 
We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that. 
But at the core of everything, after safety in the community, is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, health care providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization, continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000 customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power. 
On the power side, the nuclear group has completed 7 of 8 refueling outages, all better than planned. There's 1 refueling outage left to go that we'll be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on the Ginna station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's world-class -- it's been world-class performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying times, we've only had 25 employees that have -- excuse me, 29 including contractors, 25 employees have been infected with the COVID virus, and all but 4 have returned to work. So the work that we're doing with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are needed has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues. 
So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial."

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. Starting with Slide 10. We earned",1975,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. 
Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were 5 to 7 degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation and our non-decoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger. 
Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility. 
ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains. 
Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically, we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact. 
Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talked to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. We've taken a cautious view of the world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range. We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate. 
I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated forecast. 
At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad -- higher bad debt. 
At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes at our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad debt mechanisms -- recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. On Slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms. 
Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility. Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels. In retail, Constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial. And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last 9 months of the year, we assume Constellation load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%. 
I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19. So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first, margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges. We are seeing the impacts of lower load on these in the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price, creating a gap in revenues. Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis. So when the customer consumes less, we undercollect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall. 
These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the pandemic. 
In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage. 
Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial and industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load. In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. Finally, across -- finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We then are $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of the year. During the quarter, we expect -- we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business, respectively. In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million, primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and '21. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in '20 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx. 
Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market and a $900 million June holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs. 
We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021, as some of the cash timing issues at the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind. If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris."

Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next 4 years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our utility operations are best-in-class. First quartile -- first quarter performance in reliability and customer satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest in the nation. We are delivering 1 out of every 9 megawatts of clean energy in a significant portion of the nation's clean energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations. 
If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged. We're focused on our growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS and growth rates if that rate was to stay this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down ExGen debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of the Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets and maximizing their value through Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit rating metrics throughout this period. 
Operator, we can now open it up for questions. Thank you."

Do you have a sense for sort of the process and sort of the potential for the legislative session to go through the summer, just given the formal ending date in May, obviously, does not coincide very well with the state's plan to sort of reopen. But it does look like there's some potential that the legislature may be able to meet if they meet sort of these health department guidelines.

It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year. And that could be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the stakeholders and we'll continue to push on that."

And if the economy continues to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future, the plans can be adjusted. But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting.

The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact. And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance for this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is, say, well, if any -- if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year. 
For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more -- a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in. We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which loads are impacted by how much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels. And the $50 million we've included is a good estimate."

We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share. Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark. 
We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue. 
Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation are -- which is very critical right now, are meeting. The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois. So we'll work and continue to work on that through May. 
Our #1 focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees. Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical and as many as possible working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure. We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults. So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system and the power plants. We're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening. We have not laid off or furloughed or reduced hours or pay as a result of the pandemic. 
We've done a couple of things. Employees diagnosed with COVID remain in pay status and no charge to sick leave. Overall, we've had 102 employees have been diagnosed with COVID, plus 25 contractors. 82 of those total count have returned back to work. And so we're continuing to focus on the health and safety and the well-being. We fully -- we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined. If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them for the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees. We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees or supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents. So that's another service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running. 
A big part -- on Slide 4 (sic) [ Slide 8 ], you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities. As you know, and you've heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March and offered to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected. And this gives us the ability to -- for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide. 
We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that. 
But at the core of everything, after safety in the community, is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, health care providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there. And we have to, as a company and an organization, continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities. We've had spring storms already this year. We restored more than 350,000 customers across the service territories in late March and early April. We've been able to do that and test ourselves on moving in resources and being able to adequately and safely shelter our employees, but allow them to work safely in the field to restore the power. 
On the power side, the nuclear group has completed 7 of 8 refueling outages, all better than planned. There's 1 refueling outage left to go that we'll be closing up later in this month, a major rewind on the Ginna station. But if you look at the majority of the plants, it's world-class -- it's been world-class performance with the outages being performed between 16 and 18 days. If you look about these trying times, we've only had 25 employees that have -- excuse me, 29 including contractors, 25 employees have been infected with the COVID virus, and all but 4 have returned to work. So the work that we're doing with PPE, social distancing and allowing the critical resources to come in and operate the facilities that are needed has been very critical to us. And as I mentioned earlier, we've expanded our care to those families that need extra resources. We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues. 
So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial."

We earned",1975,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year. 
Starting with Slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were 5 to 7 degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation and our non-decoupled utilities. This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger. 
Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather. Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility. 
ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains. 
Turning to Slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook. Taking into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share. While typically, we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact. 
Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve. In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talked to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks. In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region. Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers. We've taken a cautious view of the world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range. We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate. 
I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability. These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated forecast. 
At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather. For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad -- higher bad debt. 
At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives. In addition to the O&M savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered CapEx by $125 million in 2020. We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. 
Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on Slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations. The majority of volumes at our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers. In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year. Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them. Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad debt mechanisms -- recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 
Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic. We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs. On Slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms. 
Turning to Slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility. Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels. In retail, Constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial. And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts. When we look at volumes for the rest of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction. For the last 9 months of the year, we assume Constellation load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%. 
I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19. So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first, margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges. We are seeing the impacts of lower load on these in the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours. Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract. If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price, creating a gap in revenues. Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis. So when the customer consumes less, we undercollect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall. 
These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract. That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the pandemic. 
In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance. We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage. 
Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions. And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial and industrial customers remains key to our strategy. First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load. In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers. Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. Finally, across -- finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I. 
You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on Slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million. $100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses. As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We then are $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of the year. During the quarter, we expect -- we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business, respectively. In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million, primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-related drag on the load business. Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline. We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter. 
We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and '21. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in '20 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter. 2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility. 
Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure. The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse. ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower CapEx. 
Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April. Given the uncertainty in that market and a $900 million June holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility. We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs. 
We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed. We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021, as some of the cash timing issues at the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind. If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris."

We have found ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done. We'll continue to look for ways we can increase profitability and cash flow through the next 3 quarters. The impact on the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy remains strong. Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next 4 years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd. Our utility operations are best-in-class. First quartile -- first quarter performance in reliability and customer satisfaction are continuing the solid performance for the rest of the year. Constellation is a premier integrator in their competitive platform. It's the most effective way to bring our generation to market while providing customizable solutions to fit the needs of customers. Our generation fleet is the cleanest in the nation. We are delivering 1 out of every 9 megawatts of clean energy in a significant portion of the nation's clean energy. We continue to advocate for policies that will compensate our nuclear fleet for the essential role it plays in reducing carbon and air pollution and ensure their continued operations. 
If you look at our value proposition on Slide 18, I'll close with this. The value proposition is unchanged. We're focused on our growth of our utilities, targeting 7.3% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We're confident in our rate base growth and the continued needs for these investments for the customers that we serve. But we're also mindful of the impact that the current 30-year treasury rate has on ComEd's distribution ROE and the impact on EPS and growth rates if that rate was to stay this low. We will use the free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down ExGen debt and support the external dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of the Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, monetizing assets and maximizing their value through Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit rating metrics throughout this period.

Do you have a sense for sort of the process and sort of the potential for the legislative session to go through the summer, just given the formal ending date in May, obviously, does not coincide very well with the state's plan to sort of reopen. But it does look like there's some potential that the legislature may be able to meet if they meet sort of these health department guidelines. What is your sense in terms of the ability of the legislature to meet and do business?"

Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker.

It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session. What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was towards the end of the year. And that could be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock. And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030. So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable. So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the stakeholders and we'll continue to push on that."

I think from a strategic perspective, a couple of things. We definitely -- for acquisition space, we'll continue to look for any value of books that come to the market. There could be some suppliers that would need to let go of their books. We've talked about our strategy before will stay the same, which is we would be looking to buy things, buy books of business that we could easily fit into our platform.

And I mean that more in the context of C&I sales, degradation improvement as well as some of the portfolio optimization and volatility dynamics here as well and how that could play out in '20 as well as what are you reflecting in '21? Just to be extra clear about that."

The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact. And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance for this year and into next year. So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is, say, well, if any -- if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect. I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to go bucket. So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year. 
For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more -- a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in. We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the month of April. As we get granular on really being able to understand which loads are impacted by how much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels. And the $50 million we've included is a good estimate."

Starting off, as you've seen from our releases this morning, the GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 per share; on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share. We had a great quarter, outperforming our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share due to achieving cost savings earlier than planned. Joe will get into it. Our load assumptions came out how we expected, but we've had excellent operations, but also have confronted some serious challenges throughout the quarter. First ComEd reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney's office in Illinois, that concludes -- includes a 3-year deferred prosecution agreement in a payment of $200 million, which ends the investigations into ComEd and Exelon. We have taken robust actions to identify and address deficiencies, including enhancing our compliance governance to prevent this type of conduct. We apologize for the past conduct that did not live up to our values. These new policies and oversight will ensure it won't happen again. We're extremely disappointed in the seriousness of the past misconduct, and we know many stakeholders understandably feel the same disappointment. We have -- you have our commitment that we will take every possible step to earn back the confidence and trust we have lost with others. This will not happen overnight and it will be a formidable task, but we are resolved to get there. 
Second, the country is addressing the important issues of racial inequity and social justice, and we are doing so as well. Our employees and communities, our customers are diverse, and we have a critical leadership role in pursuing equity and fairness for all those who are facing ingrained injustice and discrimination. That means living our values both within and outside the walls of our company. Sponsoring job programs in underserved communities is a big focus of ours, developing a larger base of diverse suppliers in our footprint, supporting through philanthropic and volunteerism a wide variety of organizations, pursuing equity and economic development, making it clear what our values are through action and speaking up when we see injustice. Focus -- our focus on our values of respect, diversity and inclusion can not waiver, and we know Black Lives Matter. All of our diverse communities matter, and we're standing to protect them and help serve them. We've doubled down on our work to support our diverse and underserved customers. an communities since we all are impacted by continued inequity, and we must do more. 
Switching to the COVID issue. COVID-19 continues to impact our communities. We remain focused on safety of our employees, running our operations at the best-in-class levels and supporting our customers and communities, incorporated pandemic-related policies into our management model that keep our employees and our contractors safe, implementing responsible reentry plans that predict are predicting on key milestones that will ensure employees' safety and confidence that they can come back to the workplace. We've created contingency plans to monitor system configuration and allow us for rapid emergency response and storm or normal operations. And providing a deferred payment arrangement for residential and low-income customers that are affected by the high rate of unemployment that we're dealing with in the communities that we serve. 
On the operational highlights. Operations are strong with the pandemic conditions and extreme storms across the territory. In early June, PECO faced its eighth largest storm in history, which brought sustained winds over 40 miles per hour and gusts to more than 60 miles per hour. 400 customers were out within an hour of the storm beginning, and -- but we were able to restore 80% of those customers with widespread damage in 36 hours. We had already prepared and drilled new procedures for storm response during the pandemic. 80% of our back office storm rolls are performed now remotely. Within 48 hours, [ 3,750 ] contractors and mutual assistance personnel were simply on-site in the PECO region to restore customers and onboard -- they were onboarded electronically, which we continue to develop the techniques for that. Despite the pandemic and the active storm season, all utilities are in top quartile for outage duration and outage frequency. 
Nuclear had its best second quarter capacity factor in more than a decade at 95.4%. Safety -- we safely completed in this quarter 5 [indiscernible]. There's been 8 for the year, and most ahead of schedule while protecting our employees and the contractors. Power dispatch match was 97.4%, and our renewable capture rate was 92.7%. So overall, very, very strong operational performance. 
We also continue to focus on our environmental stewardship. In July, we released our 2019 corporate sustainability report that shows the accomplishments that we made. Benchmarking air emissions report once again found Exelon as the lowest carbon emission rate of the top 20 investor-owned power producers, nearly 5x less than the #2 producer and the largest producer of carbon-free generation. In 2019, utility energy efficiency programs helped customers save 22.3 million megawatt hours and avoid 8.7 million metric tons of carbon. Exelon utilities set a goal to electrify 30% of of the vehicle fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030, avoiding more than 65,000 metric tons of carbon from 2020 to 2030. We're committed to deliver affordable 0 emissions power in helping our customers and our community reduce the harmful emissions that there exist in their communities. These efforts are important to transition to a clean energy economy, but they are not enough to address the climate crisis. We continue to advocate for policies at the state and federal levels that will address the challenges. 
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities, and our hedge disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 9. We earned $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.29 per share, net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven largely by ComEd formula rate timing and O&M timing, which was partially offset by the record-setting storm in the Philadelphia area, which caused for $0.04 per share to PECO. 
ExGen outperformed expectations for the second quarter, earning $0.26 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where we saw targeted savings for 2020 coming sooner than we originally budgeted. These savings were realized by lower outage cost, lower labor costs, travel and entertainment and training costs being lower as well. On the last call, we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID-19, which we expected would be more weighted to the back half of this year. The organization has been hard at work and is on track to achieve these savings in 2020, with some coming earlier than anticipated, as you can see in our second quarter results. 
During the quarter, load at the Utility and Constellation was in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, and we are affirming our full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 per share. 
On Slide 10, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings [indiscernible]. The $0.55 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.05 per share lower than the second quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were down $0.10 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven primarily by storm costs at PECO, ComEd formula rate timing and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable weather at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.05 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and income taxes. This was partially offset by lower capacity revenue, primarily in PJM, and the impacts of COVID-19 on load and bad debt expense. 
Turning to Slide 11. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we remain in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range, with a 9.1% trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter. Earned ROEs for the utilities remain above 9%, but dipped from last quarter by 60 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by lower earnings at PICO as a result of the June storm, higher bad debt at PECO and PHI and declining treasury yields, which impact the ComEd's ROE. As a reminder, this calculation is backward looking, so as we think about the next couple of quarters, you should expect to see some pressure on ROEs as we roll off the better pre-COVID-19 earnings quarters and carry the burdens of PICO's poor first quarter weather and second quarter storms as well as the impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. These headwinds are captured in our full year guidance, so you should have the financial impact already assumed. Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger earned returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets. 
Turning to Slide 12. Since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, regulators in all our jurisdictions have approved COVID-19 recovery mechanisms. Second, BGE was the first utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan after getting the green light on this approach from the Maryland PSC in February. The filing will support planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well investments made in late 2019 to maintain an increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution system. The critical infrastructure sector will be a key component to Maryland's economic recovery, and BGE has designed a multiyear energy infrastructure investment and customer relief plan to assist with the economic recovery. BGE will invest more than $5 billion to fund enhancements to the safety, reliability, security, resiliency and environmental attributes of the grid and improve customers' experience. BGE is expected to support more than 26,000 jobs and have at least $15 billion of economic impact over the 3-year period, which is critical as communities manage through the pandemic recovery. In conjunction with the filing, BG&E will provide customer relief and assistance in 2020 to 2023 for limited income customers and small businesses. We expect an order this December. 
Third, in June, Pepco filed their multiyear plan enhanced proposal in D.C. with the PSC, addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic challenges. The enhanced plan would expand and establish a series of customer programs, targeting those that have been hardest hit, including small businesses, nonprofits and our residential customers. The flexibility of the multiyear plan structure provides Pepco the ability to offer these innovative adjustments in response to the pandemic. We expect an order by year-end. 
Fourth, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in modernizing the grid's reliability, resiliency and clean energy growth have improved reliability by [ 70% ] while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago. 
And finally, last month, Delmarva Maryland received a final [ letter ] for its distribution rate case. The Maryland commission approved the proposed order by the public utility law judge that recommended an $11.7 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Delmarva's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%. We believe it is recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 24 through 30 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 13. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the utilities, investing $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $2.9 billion of capital into our utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of all of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, we are on track for the year. Today, I will discuss 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
The first project is Atlantic City Electric Moss Mills Moss Farm transmission line rebuild, which is a $69 million project to rebuild 15 miles of 69 kV transmission lines and poles. This project upgrades a critical transmission line that runs through the entire Northeastern portion of the Atlantic City territory in New Jersey spanning 3 different counties. Additionally, the Chestnut Neck substation will be retired and replaced with a modernized mobile ready substation, allowing for incremental flexibility. 
The second project is PECO's substation project in Philadelphia. The $68 million project includes replacement of an existing 75-year old substation with a new modernized substation and extension of 230 kV transmission lines and new 13 kV feeders into West Philadelphia. This project improves infrastructure that serves 10,000 customers in the Overbrook and Bala areas, including hospitals and universities. It will also enable customers to implement solar energy solutions. PECO engaged local diverse companies to participate with project implementation and construction, which provided approximately 250,000 construction hours. 
On Slide 14, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 since the last quarter. We executed new business consistent with our plan. In 2020, open gross margin is flat to the first quarter, and we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. In 2021, open gross margin increased by $200 million due to increasing power prices across most regions. This was offset by our hedges and lower capacity revenues in New York and uncleared capacity from the PJM incremental auctions. In 2021, we executed $50 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower increases. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 4% to 7% when considering cross commodity hedges. 
On Slide 15, I'll give a brief update on Constellation's business and what we've seen to date on load performance. During the second quarter, commercial and industrial customer load was in line with our expectations. Load was within our down 9% to 15% projected range, although it varied from week to week. Our load forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged. As we get more information, we are getting a better handle on the impacts from COVID-19, which is helping us to monitor how specific regions, customers and industries are behaving with respect to COVID-19 impacts as they continue to evolve. Additionally, we are working with our large customers to better understand their load impacts and outlook. Even as we evolve to an ever-changing landscape, our focus remains on being strategic partners with our customers and providing clean energy products. We work with our customers by providing proactive analytics and insights on their current loads, tools to manage and optimize in real time and navigate emerging trends such as electrification impacts to their businesses, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. This partnership is key to our success and provides the most stability for our business via high retention rates and consistent margins. 
Moving on to Slide 16. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the pressures from COVID-19 as discussed in detail last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.5x and 2.0x when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the rating front, in July, Fitch affirmed our ratings and S&P took action to downgrade ComEd's issuer credit rating. However, S&P reaffirmed the senior secured and short-term ratings at ComEd, therefore, not impacting our anticipated cost of borrowing. Furthermore, S&P changed the ratings outlook for Exelon Corporate, PECO, Pepco Holdings, ComEd and ExGen to negative from stable. While we are disappointed in these actions, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. 
We have successfully executed all of our planned long-term debt financings for the year. The 2020 financing plan was significantly accelerated to take advantage of attractive market conditions and provide ample short-term liquidity, leaving us well positioned for the balance of the year. The issuances in the second quarter were all meaningfully oversubscribed, and we secured record-setting low interest rates at the utilities. 
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We go through a very rigorous planning process, and we disclose the results of that process each year on our fourth quarter call. And under that most recent plan, there is no equity issuance in the plan. Last month, we kicked off that process for our next plan that will take us through the end of this year. And as you can imagine, Shar, there's many variables that go into that process, market prices for power, obviously, treasury rates our load forecast, our O&M projections, what our capital plans are, funding strategy when you think about debt. And obviously, we still have the FRR out there, and that will be taken into account. What I would say is we don't take any one of those variables in isolation. They obviously all work together to create the basis for our plan. We've been successful in -- with our strong balance sheet and growing our utilities, and we've been harvesting the cash flow of ExGen to help do that. 
We also look at the levers we have, right? We've been pretty successful with our cost cuttings over the last 5 years, obviously. We've sold some assets. We look at alternative financing arrangements. And the last thing on that list is equity. But in our current plan, there is no need for equity.

I mean, in the past, it felt like you weren't confident if the ExGen business could be spun out without IG rating sufficient scale. With what we're seeing with IPPs eventually going IG, which would certainly alleviate the liquidity requirements, others looking at their own [indiscernible] fossil fleet as they de-risk, can you give us any refreshed thoughts on the Genco as a strategic fit within the portfolio over the long term? I guess do you now have some incremental confidence that the Genco business could eventually stand on its own without the support from corporate? I mean a transaction would obviously alleviate balance sheet concerns and in the valuation disconnect, and we've obviously seen a few players looking to simplify kind of their own structures. So whether we're talking about the entire fleet or simply the fossil fuel assets, has your strategic thinking kind of changed over the past, let's say, 12 months?"

We have enjoyed a period of time of free cash flow from the Genco that has allowed us to have a significant investment into the utilities for the benefit of the customers over a period of time since our last review. As you can imagine, it's something that we always look at. And I understand the basis of the question with the recent announcements from 2 other companies on where they have decided to go. But right now, there's work to be done to create the certainty and the value of the cash flows that would be maintained to allow a company to either stand on its own or continue to support the growth of the other side of the business. And so we're in the middle of trying to work through a legislative strategy in Illinois. We're on firm ground in New York. I know there's work going on in New Jersey. We have to look at the value of the assets and what's going on in Maryland and what can be done there legislatively to compensate the assets for their low carbon output. So it's something we look at, and it's something that we think we have been very clear on from the beginning. And it's good to see other IPPs coming along and understanding the value of being investment-grade and not having stressed balance sheets with commodity cyclicality like we see. But we think we can improve the value further and the strength further to be able to serve the states and the communities that we serve with good, well-paying jobs, a strong balance sheet. And then we will continue to assess do the assets stay bolted together through a corporate holding company structure or is it better for all stakeholders involved to have some type of separation of the entities. 
The one thing I can tell you is there's an annual review on all the nonnuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue. And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else's portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we'll do that. There's assets that we'll shut down that aren't carrying their own weight. There are assets in New England that have a finite period of time under the ISOS regulation. And so there is a constant flux in our nonnuclear business that we'll continue to evaluate with our focus on strong balance sheet debt reduction and optimizing what we have on the balance sheet."

The first half of the question, does it affect the Exelon Generation's drive for legislation on changing the capacity market. There's an obviou",588,"Sure. I'm going to let Joe Dominguez jump in on the second half of the question. He's here with us in the room. The first half of the question, does it affect the Exelon Generation's drive for legislation on changing the capacity market. There's an obvious issue that trust has been eroded. Although it's isolated to ComEd, it has effect on all the entities. And so there's been a lot of press reporting and there's been some disappointed stakeholders and is rightfully so. And so our job is to rebuild the trust of those that we serve and make sure that we can show that we have done a fantastic job, and Joe will cover some of this, in the investments that have been made at ComEd and what the rate structure is done for us. It has been totally super beneficial to the consumer. But there's a period of time where we're just going to have to continue outreach conversation and show our commitment to ethical behavior that doesn't compromise our integrity or the trustworthiness of us going forward. So we're still working to engage with stakeholders on a capacity market redesign. It's very critical for us to get it done. As you know, PJM is going to run an auction. And there's a strong sense from our analytic folks that the -- some of the nuclear units are not going to be picked up in that auction. Some are uneconomic at this point right now and some more may become uneconomic. And our commitment to you has always been if we can't find a way or path to profitability, we'll have to shut them down, which is a sad turn of events that will affect the state's goals on carbon reduction. It will severely affect the communities around the plants and the very high-paying, critical jobs that those communities benefit from. 
So -- but it's an unfortunate thing. We apologize for what went on. We had a code of conduct that clearly declined the behaviors, but it wasn't enough. And so we've put controls in place to ensure it will never happen again. And we have to work with stakeholders, not only legislative and elected folks, but our customers and our other stakeholders and the communities that we serve to rebuild that trust. One thing I can tell you is this company is committed to doing the right thing for the communities that we serve, not only through philanthropic activities, but also volunteerism. I think you can look at us in all the communities we serve, and we're probably the strongest corporate partner out there, and we're going to continue that. And we know that we're only as good as a company as the communities that we serve. So that's what we've got to get back to. This is the most unfortunate thing to happen, not just because of time, it's because of trust. And it's because of a small amount of individuals making decisions that should not have been done and it shouldn't have gone undetected. But with that said, we still remain confident that the consumers have been protected, served. And as you heard me say, we have lower rates and high reliability than we did 10 years ago. And so that's because we have a strong regulations -- a regulatory body that's focused on the same thing that we're focused on, is reliable, affordable, clean energy. 
With that, I'll let Joe talk about what his thoughts are on rates making and regulatory process."

I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a",760,"Thanks, Chris. I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a continuation of the formula with additional transparency or a return to traditional rate making. As both Chris and Joe talked about, we think the formula has provided enormous benefits to our customers. If you take a look at Page 7 on the deck, you see the key metrics, and you see all green for ComEd. But in a certain sense, that almost understates the performance at ComEd. We are not only top quartile in all those dimensions, we're actually top decile in all of those dimensions. And last year at ComEd, we had the best-performing year ever in the history of the company, over 110 years best-performing year. And as I look at the metrics at the close of July, we are tracking [ 20% ] better than last year in SAIFI and 11% better in KAITI. So we've still got a number of months to go, but very, very proud of the team at ComEd and the operational performance. Customer satisfaction is highest it's ever been. We were J.D. Power's #1 Midwest utility at the end of 2019. We had never achieved that objective. So I focus on that because -- for 2 reasons. One, the transformation that's occurred at ComEd, and it's been recognized here. And second, we always tell you that from an Exelon perspective, and Chris says this virtually every call, that we think of good regulatory and political outcomes as being driven by good operational performance. And I think at ComEd, we can lay claim to perhaps have the best operational performance in the country. 
So we'll see what that looks like going forward. From comments from the governor's office that we've recently seen, it's clear that, at least from his perspective, the formula was tied to the transformation that's occurred, the investments in smart meters and other devices. And to the extent that there is a renewal or a new methodology that's installed, that's going to have to be related to a new policy objective, and that's tied up in a lot of the clean energy goals. But I guess from my perspective, Steve, whether we continue with the formula or whether we return to traditional rate making, I think the entire team at ComEd believes it's got to be constructive. And one reason we're confident in that is that there's been an evolution in Illinois. As we've been in the formula, Illinois policy for ratemaking has evolved. The state now uses forward-looking test years and the gas utilities have used that. That's been constructive. We're decoupled as a state. We have bad debt and other rider mechanisms that are strong and transparent and better than we were in 2011 when we first went to the formula. But I guess the biggest difference that I would point to is the operational performance between 2011 and now is so much better. If you take the thesis that operational performance drives regulatory results, then in a certain sense, the outcomes we were seeing in 2011 were driven by poor operational performance at ComEd. And today, that's a different story. And so the final point I would make is we've had an 8-year history of making the investments in underground cables and poles and including smart devices across our system. Not only -- the commission has seen that now for 8 years. What we'd be continuing, whether it's in a formula rate or traditional rate making, is those programs that have been wildly successful in terms of improving reliability, integrating clean energy, making the system more resilient in the face of climate change and doing all of that stuff and keeping customer bills low. As Chris said, our average bill today -- or I think Joe said this, is lower than it was 10 years ago. And in part, that's a story about wholesale power prices. But in big measure, it's about energy efficiency at ComEd and the overall efficiency of the organization. 
So the punchline for me is this, Steve. Regardless of whether we're in formula or not, I think we've got good alignment in terms of the investments we're making in the system. We're going to continue to make those prudent investments going forward, and I think the results are going to be constructive."

So Julien, let me answer the short question that you asked last first. Yes, if we return to traditional rate making, we would intend to file a rate case using a forward-looking test year, and that rate case would likely be filed in the first quarter of 2023. So that's #1. In terms of the franchise agreement, we've been through a process with the city where we've been meeting periodically just about every week, although that got interrupted a bit with COVID. We're making good progress, I thought, on the franchise agreement. Then we have the DPA. And we had a hearing last week with City Council and also some input from the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office indicated that from her perspective, 2 things need to happen before we could continue the conversation around the franchise agreement. One is we have to deal with the ethics reforms and the compliance mechanisms. And from my perspective, that is assuring the city that the measures we've taken are the appropriate ones and then having reporting requirements and other things with the city so that they understand that we're implementing those and that we're moving forward appropriately. The Mayor has a big ethics agenda, so we're going to embrace that ethics agenda. Here, the hiring of Dave Locker, which we've talked about before, is quite an important piece. Dave has -- comes to us with an impeccable reputation. As many of you know, he came out of the U.S. Attorney's office, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division of bad office for 11 years. But most importantly, and for folks outside of Northern Illinois, you don't see this, but Dave has an unbelievable reputation within the community. And for folks like the Mayor who have served in the U.S. Attorney's office as a colleague of Dave's, that's quite an important point. But we need to work through ensuring that we have a transparent mechanism of providing regular updates to the city in terms of the adherence to the new protocols that we've adopted. That's one piece of it. 
The Mayor has also indicated that we need to be committed to the goals of sustainability, to the goals of equitable and affordable energy for all customers in the city. And that's kind of the sweet spot of our strategy around electrification, around clean energy, energy efficiency, the many jobs programs we sponsor. So we look forward to a good conversation on that. There's a tangential issue relating to the franchise agreement that being the issue of the city's takeover or municipalization of the grid here in Chicago. We've spoken about that previously on this call. Commissioner Reynolds, who is leading for the city the negotiations with ComEd, testified at the hearing last week and indicated that the city will have a feasibility study out shortly on the possibility of municipalization. At least he indicated in his testimony that, that would that -- that the -- the view would be that, that would not be feasible. And there's a few big reasons for that. One is it's a $5 billion to $6 billion system and then the separation cost would be another $5 billion. So I think we'll tie together a few of these issues here. We need to assure the city of the reforms I've talked about. We'll have a conversation about the programs around clean energy, electrification, jobs programs, benefits to customers' affordability. And then I imagine we'll continue to have this backdrop of municipalization. But if the feasibility study comes out as Commissioner Reynolds indicated, I don't think that's going to necessarily be a pathway. But we have our work to do with the city. I'm confident we will get there. It may take a year or more to hash out. That's something Commissioner Reynolds indicated as well. But the way our franchise agreement works, and I've talked about this previously on this call, is that if it has not continued, it simply rolls over year-to-year on its own terms. It's like a lease in that sense where it just automatically renews year-to-year. So that's probably more than you wanted to hear, Julien, but that's the whole story on the franchise agreement."

We'll continue to challenge ourselves in that regard. There's other variables, too, right? We just talked about the Illinois legislation, what is the outcome of that. That will have a -- obviously be a binary impact. How much capital are we putting into our utilities and what that looks like. And all of those things go into the to the decision-making. Chris talked about on economic assets and actions around those. We've clearly sold assets where we thought the market had higher values on them. We've looked at alternative financings and have used project financing. We did the securitization of the receivables at Constellation. So there's a lot of elements to it, Stephen. Some are kind of decisions we control. Others, we're part of and we're working on, and they build upon themselves. And ultimately, we -- our dividend, we have to make a recommendation to the Board at the end of this year, and we'll do that and determine how much capital we're putting in across our footprint.

I can tell you there's a significant effort and contingency planning going on within the generating company and the BSC, the business services company, now on if we maintain the fleet as we have it, how are we going to do it more economically, how are we using technology. Then a significant amount of work in the financial organization, legal, other organizations to look at the world differently. And we'll announce our next round probably in third quarter, fourth quarter. I'm looking at Dan to make sure I'm answering right because he's either responsible for this, and he's waving his hands at me. So the fourth quarter call. But -- and we'll have a better picture of the future life of the nuclear fleet by that point. And if we are in the mode of unfortunately retiring plants, you can imagine that we'll have a significant reduction in the BSC overheads that could go back to the benefit of the customers from the modified Massachusetts formula. I wouldn't necessarily say it gives them more headroom to spend capital. We spend capital that is needed capital for reliability and customer service. But it should -- if the -- it should benefit the customers and take some of the overhead burden off of the utilities as we continue to refine how we can do work cheaper, better, faster, be very efficient, while serving the communities and the customers. 
There's one thing we learned during this pandemic. Our real estate footprint may not have to be as big as it is right now. We are very efficiently working with about 17,000 people working remotely. And there's a group right now that's assessing not only a safe reentry around the 1st of the year for some portion of the workforce that's not on the line and maintaining the system or the plants or backing those individuals up. But we will take a very strong look at all expenses around and footprint around facilities. We've closed the books with the controller's organization, only having a few people come in for a couple of days. And audit has maintained its schedule and it's in-depth audit programs. So we're doing a lot, and we're learning a lot, and I think that's going to translate into more savings as we go forward. But looking at Dan again, I guess I'm not going to be committal on the time. But they're all squirming around me right now. I'll -- we'll be back to you at the end of the year with outlook."

Starting off, as you've seen from our releases this morning, the GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 per share; on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share. We had a great quarter, outperforming our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share due to achieving cost savings earlier than planned. Joe will get into it. Our load assumptions came out how we expected, but we've had excellent operations, but also have confronted some serious challenges throughout the quarter. First ComEd reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney's office in Illinois, that concludes -- includes a 3-year deferred prosecution agreement and a payment of $200 million, which ends the investigations into ComEd and Exelon. We have taken robust actions to identify and address deficiencies, including enhancing our compliance governance to prevent this type of conduct. We apologize for the past conduct that did not live up to our values. These new policies and oversight will ensure it won't happen again. We're extremely disappointed in the seriousness of the past misconduct, and we know many stakeholders understandably feel the same disappointment. We have -- you have our commitment that we will take every possible step to earn back the confidence and trust we have lost with others. This will not happen overnight and it will be a formidable task, but we are resolved to get there.  
Second, the country is addressing the important issues of racial and inequity and social justice, and we are doing so as well. Our employees and communities, our customers are diverse, and we have a critical leadership role in pursuing equity and fairness for all those who are facing ingrained injustice and discrimination. That means living our values both within and outside the walls of our company. Sponsoring job programs in underserved communities is a big focus of ours, developing a larger base of diverse suppliers in our footprint, supporting through philanthropic and volunteerism a wide variety of organizations, pursuing equity and economic development, making it clear what our values are through action and speaking up when we see injustice. Focus -- our focus on our values of respect, diversity and inclusion can not waiver, and we know Black Lives Matter, all of our diverse communities matter, and we're standing to protect them and help serve them. We've doubled down on our work to support our diverse and underserved customers and communities since we all are impacted by continued inequity, and we must do more.  
Switching to the COVID issue. COVID-19 continues to impact our communities. We remain focused on safety of our employees, running our operations at the best-in-class levels and supporting our customers and communities, incorporate pandemic-related policies into our management model that keep our employees and our contractors safe, implementing responsible reentry plans that predict -- are predicting on key milestones that will ensure employees' safety and confidence that they can come back to the workplace. We've created contingency plans to monitor system configuration and allow us for rapid emergency response in storm or normal operations. And providing a deferred payment arrangement for residential and low income customers that are affected by the high rate of unemployment that we're dealing with in the communities that we serve.  
On the operational highlights. Operations are strong with the pandemic conditions and extreme storms across the territory. In early June, PECO faced its eighth largest storm in history, which brought sustained winds of over 40 miles per hour and gusts of more than 60 miles per hour. 400 customers were out within an hour of the storm beginning, and -- but we were able to restore 80% of those customers with widespread damage in 36 hours. We had already prepared and drilled new procedures for storm response during the pandemic. 80% of our back office storm rolls are performed now remotely. Within 48 hours, 3,750 contractors and mutual assistance personnel were safely on-site in the PECO region to restore customers and onboard -- they were onboarded electronically, which -- we continue to develop the techniques for that. Despite the pandemic and the active storm season, all Utilities are in top quartile for outage duration and outage frequency.  
Nuclear had its best second quarter capacity factor in more than a decade at 95.4%. Safety -- we safely completed in this quarter 5 [indiscernible]. There's been 8 for the year, and most ahead of schedule while protecting our employees and the contractors. Power dispatch match was 97.4%, and our renewable capture rate was 92.7%. So overall, very, very strong operational performance.  
We also continue to focus on our environmental stewardship. In July, we released our 2019 corporate sustainability report that shows the accomplishments that we made. Benchmarking air emissions report once again found Exelon as the lowest carbon emission rate of the top 20 investor-owned power producers, nearly 5x less than the #2 producer and the largest producer of carbon-free generation. In 2019, utility energy efficiency programs helped customers save 22.3 million megawatt hours and avoid 8.7 million metric tons of carbon. Exelon Utilities set a goal to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030, avoiding more than 65,000 metric tons of carbon from 2020 to 2030. We're committed to deliver affordable 0 emissions power in helping our customers and our community reduce the harmful emissions that there -- exist in their communities. These efforts are important to transition to a clean energy economy, but they are not enough to address the climate crisis. We continue to advocate for policies at the state and federal levels that will address the challenges.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."

Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.  
Turning to Slide 9. We earned $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.29 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven largely by ComEd formula rate timing and O&M timing, which was partially offset by the record-setting storm in the Philadelphia area, which cost for $0.04 per share to PECO.  
ExGen outperformed expectations for the second quarter, earning $0.26 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where we saw targeted savings for 2020 coming sooner than we originally budgeted. These savings were realized by lower outage cost, lower labor costs, travel and entertainment and training costs being lower as well. On the last call, we introduced -- we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID-19, which we expected would be more weighted to the back half of this year. The organization has been hard at work and is on track to achieve these savings in 2020, with some coming earlier than anticipated, as you can see in our second quarter results.  
During the quarter, load at the Utility and Constellation was in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, and we are affirming our full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 per share.  
On Slide 10, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.55 per share in second quarter of this year was $0.05 per share lower than the second quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were down $0.10 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven primarily by storm costs at PECO, ComEd formula rate timing and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable weather at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.05 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and income taxes. This was partially offset by lower capacity revenue, primarily in PJM, and the impacts of COVID-19 on load and bad debt expense.  
Turning to Slide 11. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we remain in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range, with a 9.1% trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter. Earned ROEs for the Utilities remained above 9%, but dipped from last quarter by 60 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by lower earnings at PECO as a result of the storm -- June storm, higher bad debt at PECO and PHI and declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. As a reminder, this calculation is backward looking, so as we think about the next couple of quarters, you should expect to see some pressure on ROEs as we roll off the better pre-COVID-19 earnings quarters and carry the burdens of PECO's poor first quarter weather and second quarter storms as well as the impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. These headwinds are captured in our full year guidance, so you should have the financial impact already assumed.  
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger earned returns at the Utilities and supporting our growth targets.  
Turning to Slide 12. I since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, regulators in all our jurisdictions have approved COVID-19 recovery mechanisms. Second, BGE was the first utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan after getting the green light on this approach from the Maryland PSC in February. The filing will support planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well investments made in late 2019 to maintain an increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution system. The critical infrastructure sector will be a key component to Maryland's economic recovery, and BGE has designed a multiyear energy infrastructure investment and customer relief plan to assist with the economic recovery. BGE will invest more than $5 billion to fund enhancements to the safety, reliability, security, resiliency and environmental attributes of the grid and improve customers' experience. BGE is expected to support more than 26,000 jobs and have at least $15 billion of economic impact over the 3-year period, which is critical as communities manage through the pandemic recovery. In conjunction with the filing, BGE will provide customer relief and assistance in 2020 to 2023 for limited income customers and small businesses. We expect an order this December.  
Third, in June, Pepco filed their multiyear plan enhanced proposal in D.C. with the PSC, addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic challenges. The enhanced plan would expand and establish a series of customer programs, targeting those that have been hardest hit, including small businesses, nonprofits and our residential customers. The flexibility of the multiyear plan structure provides Pepco the ability to offer these innovative adjustments in response to the pandemic. We expect an order by year-end.  
Fourth, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in modernizing the grid's reliability, resiliency and clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago.  
And finally, last month, Delmarva and Maryland received a final order for its distribution rate case. The Maryland commission approved the proposed order by the Public Utility Law Judge that recommended an $11.7 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Delmarva's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%. We believe it is recognition of strong performance and reliability and customer satisfaction. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 24 through 30 of the appendix.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the Utilities, investing $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $2.9 billion of capital into our Utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of all of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, we are on track for the year. Today, I will discuss 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  
The first project is Atlantic City Electric Moss Mills - Moss Farm (sic) [ Moss Mill - Motts Farm ] transmission line rebuild, which is a $69 million project to rebuild 15 miles of 69 kV transmission lines and poles. This project upgrades a critical transmission line that runs through the entire Northeastern portion of the Atlantic City territory in New Jersey spanning 3 different counties. Additionally, the Chestnut Neck Substation will be retired and replaced with a modernized mobile-ready substation, allowing for incremental flexibility.  
The second project is PECO's upland substation project in Philadelphia. The $68 million project includes replacement of an existing 75-year old substation with a new modernized substation and extension of 230 kV transmission lines and new 13 kV feeders into West Philadelphia. This project improves infrastructure that serves 10,000 customers in the Overbrook and Bala areas, including hospitals and universities. It will also enable customers to implement solar energy solutions. PECO engaged local diverse companies to participate with project implementation and construction, which provided approximately 250,000 construction hours.  
On Slide 14, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 since the last quarter. We executed new business consistent with our plan. In 2020, open gross margin is flat to the first quarter, and we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. In 2021, open gross margin increased by $200 million due to increasing power prices across most regions. This was offset by our hedges and lower capacity revenues in New York and uncleared capacity from the PJM incremental auctions. In 2021, we executed $50 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 4% to 7% when considering cross commodity hedges.  
On Slide 15, I'll give a brief update on Constellation's business and what we've seen to date on load performance. During the second quarter, commercial and industrial customer load was in line with our expectations. Load was within our down 9% to 15% projected range, although it varied from week to week. Our load forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged. As we get more information, we are getting a better handle on the impacts from COVID-19, which is helping us to monitor how specific regions, customers and industries are behaving with respect to COVID-19 impacts as they continue to evolve. Additionally, we are working with our large customers to better understand their load impacts and outlook. Even as we evolve to an ever-changing landscape, our focus remains on being strategic partners with our customers and providing clean energy products. We work with our customers by providing proactive analytics and insights on their current loads, tools to manage and optimize in real time and navigate emerging trends such as electrification impacts to their businesses, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. This partnership is key to our success and provides the most stability for our business via high retention rates and consistent margins.  
Moving on to Slide 16. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the pressures from COVID-19 as discussed in detail last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.5x and 2.0x when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the rating front, in July, Fitch affirmed our ratings and S&P took action to downgrade ComEd's issuer credit rating. However, S&P reaffirmed the senior secured and short-term ratings at ComEd, therefore, not impacting our anticipated cost of borrowing. Furthermore, S&P changed the ratings outlook for Exelon Corporate, PECO, Pepco Holdings, ComEd and ExGen to negative from stable. While we were disappointed in these actions, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings.  
We have successfully executed all of our planned long-term debt financings for the year. The 2020 financing plan was significantly accelerated to take advantage of attractive market conditions and provide ample short-term liquidity, leaving us well positioned for the balance of the year. The issuances in the second quarter were all meaningfully oversubscribed, and we secured record-setting low interest rates at the Utilities.  
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We will use the free cash flow as we have done from the Genco to support utility growth, pay down Genco debt and support some of the external dividend.  
We continue to optimize the value of the Gen business by seeking fair compensation for our 0 emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets and maximizing their value through the Constellation avenue. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics. We have remained committed to that and will not waiver. And we'll grow our dividend at this point right now annually at 5% through 2020. The strategic underpinning of this value proposition is sound, effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders.

And as you know, we've received this question many times over the last few months. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and it's a central tenant to our business and it has been quite frankly for a very long time. We go through a very rigorous planning process, and we disclose the results of that process each year on our fourth quarter call. And under that most recent plan, there is no equity issuance in the plan. Last month, we kicked off that process for our next plan that will take us through the end of this year. And as you can imagine, Shar, there's many variables that go into that process, market prices for power, obviously, treasury rates, our load forecast, our O&M projections, what our capital plans are, funding strategy when you think about debt. And obviously, we still have the FRR out there, and that will be taken into account. What I would say is we don't take any one of those variables in isolation. They obviously all work together to create the basis for our plan. We've been successful in -- with our strong balance sheet and growing our Utilities, and we've been harvesting the cash flow of ExGen to help do that. 
We also look at the levers we have, right? We've been pretty successful with our cost cuttings over the last 5 years, obviously. We've sold some assets. We look at alternative financing arrangements. And the last thing on that list is equity. But in our current plan, there is no need for equity. And as we move through the planning process and that takes us through the end of the year, we'll relay or communicate the outcome of that on our fourth quarter call."

I mean, in the past, it felt like you weren't confident if the ExGen business could be spun out without IG rating sufficient scale. With what we're seeing with IPPs eventually going IG, which would certainly alleviate the liquidity requirements, others looking at their own merchant fossil fleet as they de-risk, can you give us any refreshed thoughts on the Genco as a strategic fit within the portfolio over the long term? I guess do you now have some incremental confidence that the Genco business could eventually stand on its own without the support from corporate? I mean a transaction would obviously alleviate balance sheet concerns and in the valuation disconnect, and we've obviously seen a few players looking to simplify kind of their own structures. So whether we're talking about the entire fleet or simply the fossil fuel assets, has your strategic thinking kind of changed over the past, let's say, 12 months?"

We have enjoyed a period of time of free cash flow from the Genco that has allowed us to have a significant investment into the Utilities for the benefit of the customers over a period of time since our last review. As you can imagine, it's something that we always look at. And I understand the basis of the question with the recent announcements from 2 other companies on where they have decided to go. But right now, there's work to be done to create the certainty and the value of the cash flows that would be maintained to allow a company to either stand on its own or continue to support the growth of the other side of the business. And so we're in the middle of trying to work through a legislative strategy in Illinois. We're on firm ground in New York. I know there's work going on in New Jersey. We have to look at the value of the assets and what's going on in Maryland and what can be done there legislatively to compensate the assets for their low carbon output. So it's something we look at, and it's something that we think we have been very clear on from the beginning. And it's good to see other IPPs coming along and understanding the value of being investment grade and not having stressed balance sheets with commodity cyclicality like we see. But we think we can improve the value further and the strength further to be able to serve the states and the communities that we serve with good, well-paying jobs, a strong balance sheet. And then we will continue to assess to -- do the assets stay bolted together through a corporate holding company structure or is it better for all stakeholders involved to have some type of separation of the entities. 
The one thing I can tell you is there's an annual review on all the nonnuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue. And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else's portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we'll do that. There's assets that we'll shut down that aren't carrying their own weight. There are assets in New England that have a finite period of time under the ISO's regulation. And so there is a constant flux in our nonnuclear business that we'll continue to evaluate with our focus on strong balance sheet debt reduction and optimizing what we have on the balance sheet."

So we're still working to engage with stakeholders on a capacity market redesign. It's very critical for us to get it done. As you know, PJM is going to run an auction. And there's a strong sense from our analytic folks that the -- some of the nuclear units are not going to be picked up in that auction. Some are uneconomic at this point right now and some more may become uneconomic. And our commitment to you has always been if we can't find a way or path to profitability, we'll have to shut them down, which is a sad turn of events that will affect the state's goals on carbon reduction. It will severely affect the communities around the plants and the very high paying, critical jobs that those communities benefit from. 
So -- but it's an unfortunate thing. We apologize for what went on. We had a code of conduct that clearly defined the behaviors, but it wasn't enough. And so we've put controls in place to ensure it will never happen again. And we have to work with stakeholders, not only legislative and elected folks, but our customers and our other stakeholders and the communities that we serve to rebuild that trust. One thing I can tell you is this company is committed to doing the right thing for the communities that we serve, not only through philanthropic activities, but also volunteerism. I think you can look at us in all the communities we serve, and we're probably the strongest corporate partner out there, and we're going to continue that. And we know that we're only as good as a company as the communities that we serve. So that's what we've got to get back to. This is the most unfortunate thing to happen, not just because of time, it's because of trust. And it's because of a small amount of individuals making decisions that should not have been done, and it shouldn't have gone undetected. But with that said, we still remain confident that the consumers have been protected, served. And as you heard me say, we have lower rates and high reliability than we did 10 years ago. And so that's because we have a strong regulations -- a regulatory body that's focused on the same thing that we're focused on, is reliable, affordable, clean energy. 
With that, I'll let Joe talk about what his thoughts are on rates making and regulatory process."

I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a",758,"Thanks, Chris. I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a continuation of the formula with additional transparency or a return to traditional rate making. As both Chris and Joe talked about, we think the formula has provided enormous benefits to our customers. If you take a look at Page 7 on the deck, you see the key metrics, and you see all green for ComEd. But in a certain sense, that almost understates the performance at ComEd. We are not only top quartile in all those dimensions, we're actually top decile in all of those dimensions. And last year at ComEd, we had the best-performing year ever in the history of the company, over 110 years best-performing year. And as I look at the metrics at the close of July, we are tracking 20% better than last year in SAIFI and 11% better in CAIDI. So we've still got a number of months to go, but very, very proud of the team at ComEd and the operational performance. Customer satisfaction is highest it's ever been. We were J.D. Power's #1 Midwest utility at the end of 2019. We had never achieved that objective. So I focus on that because -- for 2 reasons. One, the transformation that's occurred at ComEd, and it's been recognized here. And second, we always tell you that from an Exelon perspective, and Chris says this virtually every call, that we think of good regulatory and political outcomes as being driven by good operational performance. And I think at ComEd, we can lay claim to perhaps having the best operational performance in the country. 
So we'll see what that looks like going forward. From comments from the governor's office that we've recently seen, it's clear that, at least from his perspective, the formula was tied to the transformation that's occurred, the investments in smart meters and other devices. And to the extent that there is a renewal or a new methodology that's installed, that's going to have to be related to a new policy objective, and that's tied up in a lot of the clean energy goals. But I guess from my perspective, Steve, whether we continue with the formula or whether we return to traditional rate making, I think the entire team at ComEd believes it's got to be constructive. And one reason we're confident in that is that there's been an evolution in Illinois. As we've been in the formula, Illinois policy for ratemaking has evolved. The state now uses forward-looking test years and the gas utilities have used that. That's been constructive. We're decoupled as a state. We have bad debt and other rider mechanisms that are strong and transparent and better than we were in 2011 when we first went to the formula. But I guess the biggest difference that I would point to is the operational performance between 2011 and now is so much better. If you take the thesis that operational performance drives regulatory results, then in a certain sense, the outcomes we were seeing in 2011 were driven by poor operational performance at ComEd. And today, that's a different story. And so the final point I would make is we've had an 8-year history of making the investments in underground cables and poles and including smart devices across our system. Not only -- the commission has seen that now for 8 years. What we'd be continuing, whether it's in a formula rate or traditional rate making, is those programs that have been wildly successful in terms of improving reliability, integrating clean energy, making the system more resilient in the face of climate change and doing all of that stuff and keeping customer bills low. As Chris said, our average bill today -- or I think Joe said this, is lower than it was 10 years ago. And in part, that's a story about wholesale power prices. But in big measure, it's about energy efficiency at ComEd and the overall efficiency of the organization. 
So the punchline for me is this, Steve. Regardless of whether we're in formula or not, I think we've got good alignment in terms of the investments we're making in the system. We're going to continue to make those prudent investments going forward, and I think the results are going to be constructive."

So Julien, let me answer the short question that you asked last first. Yes, if we return to traditional rate making, we would intend to file a rate case using a forward-looking test year, and that rate case would likely be filed in the first quarter of 2023. So that's number one. In terms of the franchise agreement, we've been through a process with the city where we've been meeting periodically just about every week, although that got interrupted a bit with COVID. We're making good progress, I thought, on the franchise agreement. Then we have the DPA. And we had a hearing last week with City Council and also some input from the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office indicated that from her perspective, 2 things need to happen before we could continue the conversation around the franchise agreement. One is we have to deal with the ethics reforms and the compliance mechanisms. And from my perspective, that is assuring the city that the measures we've taken are the appropriate ones and then having reporting requirements and other things with the city so that they understand that we're implementing those and that we're moving forward appropriately. The Mayor has a big ethics agenda, so we're going to embrace that ethics agenda. Here, the hiring of Dave Glockner, which we've talked about before, is quite an important piece. Dave has -- comes to us with an impeccable reputation. As many of you know, he came out of the U.S. Attorney's office, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division at that office for 11 years. But most importantly, and for folks outside of Northern Illinois, you don't see this, but Dave has an unbelievable reputation within the community. And for folks like the Mayor who have served in the U.S. Attorney's office as a colleague of Dave's, that's quite an important point. But we need to work through ensuring that we have a transparent mechanism of providing regular updates to the city in terms of the adherence to the new protocols that we've adopted. That's one piece of it. 
The Mayor has also indicated that we need to be committed to the goals of sustainability, to the goals of equitable and affordable energy for all customers in the city. And that's kind of the sweet spot of our strategy around electrification, around clean energy, energy efficiency, the many jobs programs we sponsor. So we look forward to a good conversation on that. There's a tangential issue relating to the franchise agreement that being the issue of the city's takeover or municipalization of the grid here in Chicago. We've spoken about that previously on this call. Commissioner Reynolds, who is leading for the city the negotiations with ComEd, testified at the hearing last week and indicated that the city will have a feasibility study out shortly on the possibility of municipalization. At least he indicated in his testimony that, that would -- that -- the view would be that, that would not be feasible. And there's a few big reasons for that. One is it's a $5 billion to $6 billion system and then the separation cost would be another $5 billion. So I think we'll tie together a few of these issues here. We need to assure the city of the reforms I've talked about. We'll have a conversation about the programs around clean energy, electrification, jobs programs, benefits to customers' affordability. And then I imagine we'll continue to have this backdrop of municipalization. But if the feasibility study comes out as Commissioner Reynolds indicated, I don't think that's going to necessarily be a pathway. But we have our work to do with the city. I'm confident we will get there. It may take a year or more to hash out. That's something Commissioner Reynolds indicated as well. But the way our franchise agreement works, and I've talked about this previously on this call, is that if it has not continued, it simply rolls over year-to-year on its own terms. It's like a lease in that sense where it just automatically renews year-to-year. So that's probably more than you wanted to hear, Julien, but that's the whole story on the franchise agreement."

We'll continue to challenge ourselves in that regard. There's other variables, too, right? We just talked about the Illinois legislation, what is the outcome of that. That will have a -- obviously be a binary impact. How much capital are we putting into our Utilities and what that looks like. And all of those things go into the -- to the decision-making. Chris talked about on economic assets and actions around those. We've clearly sold assets where we thought the market had higher values on them. We've looked at alternative financings and have used project financing. We did the securitization of the receivables at Constellation. So there's a lot of elements to it, Stephen. Some are kind of decisions we control. Others, we're part of and we're working on, and they build upon themselves. And ultimately, we -- our dividend, we have to make a recommendation to the Board at the end of this year, and we'll do that and determine how much capital we're putting in across our footprint.

Then a significant amount of work in the financial organization, HR, legal, other organizations to look at the world differently. And we'll announce our next round probably in third quarter -- fourth quarter. I'm looking at Dan to make sure I'm answering right because he's responsible for this, and he's waving his hands at me. So the fourth quarter call. But -- and we'll have a better picture of the future life of the nuclear fleet by that point. And if we are in the mode of unfortunately retiring plants, you can imagine that we'll have a significant reduction in the BSC overheads that could go back to the benefit of the customers from the modified Massachusetts formula. I wouldn't necessarily say it gives them more headroom to spend capital. We spend capital that is needed capital for reliability and customer service. But it should -- if the -- it should benefit the customers and take some of the overhead burden off of the utilities as we continue to refine how we can do work cheaper, better, faster, be very efficient, while serving the communities and the customers. 
There's one thing we've learned during this pandemic. Our real estate footprint may not have to be as big as it is right now. We are very efficiently working with about 17,000 people working remotely. And there's a group right now that's assessing not only a safe reentry around the 1st of the year for some portion of the workforce that's not on the line and maintaining the system or the plants or backing those individuals up. But we will take a very strong look at all expenses around and footprint around facilities. We've closed the books with the controller's organization, only having a few people come in for a couple of days. And audit has maintained its schedule and it's in-depth audit programs. So we're doing a lot, and we're learning a lot, and I think that's going to translate into more savings as we go forward. But looking at Dan again, I guess I'm not going to be committal on the time. But they're all squirming around me right now. I'll -- we'll be back to you at the end of the year with outlook."

Starting off, as you've seen from our releases this morning, the GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 per share; on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share. We had a great quarter, outperforming our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share due to achieving cost savings earlier than planned. Joe will get into it. Our load assumptions came out how we expected, but we've had excellent operations, but also have confronted some serious challenges throughout the quarter. First ComEd reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney's office in Illinois, that concludes -- includes a 3-year deferred prosecution agreement and a payment of $200 million, which ends the investigations into ComEd and Exelon. We have taken robust actions to identify and address deficiencies, including enhancing our compliance governance to prevent this type of conduct. We apologize for the past conduct that did not live up to our values. These new policies and oversight will ensure it won't happen again. We're extremely disappointed in the seriousness of the past misconduct, and we know many stakeholders understandably feel the same disappointment. We have -- you have our commitment that we will take every possible step to earn back the confidence and trust we have lost with others. This will not happen overnight and it will be a formidable task, but we are resolved to get there.  
Second, the country is addressing the important issues of racial and inequity and social justice, and we are doing so as well. Our employees and communities, our customers are diverse, and we have a critical leadership role in pursuing equity and fairness for all those who are facing ingrained injustice and discrimination. That means living our values both within and outside the walls of our company. Sponsoring job programs in underserved communities is a big focus of ours, developing a larger base of diverse suppliers in our footprint, supporting through philanthropic and volunteerism a wide variety of organizations, pursuing equity and economic development, making it clear what our values are through action and speaking up when we see injustice. Focus -- our focus on our values of respect, diversity and inclusion can not waiver, and we know Black Lives Matter, all of our diverse communities matter, and we're standing to protect them and help serve them. We've doubled down on our work to support our diverse and underserved customers and communities since we all are impacted by continued inequity, and we must do more.  
Switching to the COVID issue. COVID-19 continues to impact our communities. We remain focused on safety of our employees, running our operations at the best-in-class levels and supporting our customers and communities, incorporate pandemic-related policies into our management model that keep our employees and our contractors safe, implementing responsible reentry plans that predict -- are predicting on key milestones that will ensure employees' safety and confidence that they can come back to the workplace. We've created contingency plans to monitor system configuration and allow us for rapid emergency response in storm or normal operations. And providing a deferred payment arrangement for residential and low income customers that are affected by the high rate of unemployment that we're dealing with in the communities that we serve.  
On the operational highlights. Operations are strong with the pandemic conditions and extreme storms across the territory. In early June, PECO faced its eighth largest storm in history, which brought sustained winds of over 40 miles per hour and gusts of more than 60 miles per hour. 400 customers were out within an hour of the storm beginning, and -- but we were able to restore 80% of those customers with widespread damage in 36 hours. We had already prepared and drilled new procedures for storm response during the pandemic. 80% of our back office storm rolls are performed now remotely. Within 48 hours, 3,750 contractors and mutual assistance personnel were safely on-site in the PECO region to restore customers and onboard -- they were onboarded electronically, which -- we continue to develop the techniques for that. Despite the pandemic and the active storm season, all Utilities are in top quartile for outage duration and outage frequency.  
Nuclear had its best second quarter capacity factor in more than a decade at 95.4%. Safety -- we safely completed in this quarter 5 [indiscernible]. There's been 8 for the year, and most ahead of schedule while protecting our employees and the contractors. Power dispatch match was 97.4%, and our renewable capture rate was 92.7%. So overall, very, very strong operational performance.  
We also continue to focus on our environmental stewardship. In July, we released our 2019 corporate sustainability report that shows the accomplishments that we made. Benchmarking air emissions report once again found Exelon as the lowest carbon emission rate of the top 20 investor-owned power producers, nearly 5x less than the #2 producer and the largest producer of carbon-free generation. In 2019, utility energy efficiency programs helped customers save 22.3 million megawatt hours and avoid 8.7 million metric tons of carbon. Exelon Utilities set a goal to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030, avoiding more than 65,000 metric tons of carbon from 2020 to 2030. We're committed to deliver affordable 0 emissions power in helping our customers and our community reduce the harmful emissions that there -- exist in their communities. These efforts are important to transition to a clean energy economy, but they are not enough to address the climate crisis. We continue to advocate for policies at the state and federal levels that will address the challenges.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."
296181,675597061,2094592,"Exelon Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.  Turning to Slide 9. We earned $0.53 per share on",1858,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.  
Turning to Slide 9. We earned $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.29 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven largely by ComEd formula rate timing and O&M timing, which was partially offset by the record-setting storm in the Philadelphia area, which cost for $0.04 per share to PECO.  
ExGen outperformed expectations for the second quarter, earning $0.26 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where we saw targeted savings for 2020 coming sooner than we originally budgeted. These savings were realized by lower outage cost, lower labor costs, travel and entertainment and training costs being lower as well. On the last call, we introduced -- we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID-19, which we expected would be more weighted to the back half of this year. The organization has been hard at work and is on track to achieve these savings in 2020, with some coming earlier than anticipated, as you can see in our second quarter results.  
During the quarter, load at the Utility and Constellation was in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, and we are affirming our full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 per share.  
On Slide 10, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.55 per share in second quarter of this year was $0.05 per share lower than the second quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were down $0.10 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven primarily by storm costs at PECO, ComEd formula rate timing and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable weather at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.05 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and income taxes. This was partially offset by lower capacity revenue, primarily in PJM, and the impacts of COVID-19 on load and bad debt expense.  
Turning to Slide 11. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we remain in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range, with a 9.1% trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter. Earned ROEs for the Utilities remained above 9%, but dipped from last quarter by 60 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by lower earnings at PECO as a result of the storm -- June storm, higher bad debt at PECO and PHI and declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. As a reminder, this calculation is backward looking, so as we think about the next couple of quarters, you should expect to see some pressure on ROEs as we roll off the better pre-COVID-19 earnings quarters and carry the burdens of PECO's poor first quarter weather and second quarter storms as well as the impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. These headwinds are captured in our full year guidance, so you should have the financial impact already assumed.  
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger earned returns at the Utilities and supporting our growth targets.  
Turning to Slide 12. I since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, regulators in all our jurisdictions have approved COVID-19 recovery mechanisms. Second, BGE was the first utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan after getting the green light on this approach from the Maryland PSC in February. The filing will support planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well investments made in late 2019 to maintain an increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution system. The critical infrastructure sector will be a key component to Maryland's economic recovery, and BGE has designed a multiyear energy infrastructure investment and customer relief plan to assist with the economic recovery. BGE will invest more than $5 billion to fund enhancements to the safety, reliability, security, resiliency and environmental attributes of the grid and improve customers' experience. BGE is expected to support more than 26,000 jobs and have at least $15 billion of economic impact over the 3-year period, which is critical as communities manage through the pandemic recovery. In conjunction with the filing, BGE will provide customer relief and assistance in 2020 to 2023 for limited income customers and small businesses. We expect an order this December.  
Third, in June, Pepco filed their multiyear plan enhanced proposal in D.C. with the PSC, addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic challenges. The enhanced plan would expand and establish a series of customer programs, targeting those that have been hardest hit, including small businesses, nonprofits and our residential customers. The flexibility of the multiyear plan structure provides Pepco the ability to offer these innovative adjustments in response to the pandemic. We expect an order by year-end.  
Fourth, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in modernizing the grid's reliability, resiliency and clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago.  
And finally, last month, Delmarva and Maryland received a final order for its distribution rate case. The Maryland commission approved the proposed order by the Public Utility Law Judge that recommended an $11.7 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Delmarva's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%. We believe it is recognition of strong performance and reliability and customer satisfaction. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 24 through 30 of the appendix.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the Utilities, investing $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $2.9 billion of capital into our Utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of all of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, we are on track for the year. Today, I will discuss 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  
The first project is Atlantic City Electric Moss Mills - Moss Farm (sic) [ Moss Mill - Motts Farm ] transmission line rebuild, which is a $69 million project to rebuild 15 miles of 69 kV transmission lines and poles. This project upgrades a critical transmission line that runs through the entire Northeastern portion of the Atlantic City territory in New Jersey spanning 3 different counties. Additionally, the Chestnut Neck Substation will be retired and replaced with a modernized mobile-ready substation, allowing for incremental flexibility.  
The second project is PECO's upland substation project in Philadelphia. The $68 million project includes replacement of an existing 75-year old substation with a new modernized substation and extension of 230 kV transmission lines and new 13 kV feeders into West Philadelphia. This project improves infrastructure that serves 10,000 customers in the Overbrook and Bala areas, including hospitals and universities. It will also enable customers to implement solar energy solutions. PECO engaged local diverse companies to participate with project implementation and construction, which provided approximately 250,000 construction hours.  
On Slide 14, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 since the last quarter. We executed new business consistent with our plan. In 2020, open gross margin is flat to the first quarter, and we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. In 2021, open gross margin increased by $200 million due to increasing power prices across most regions. This was offset by our hedges and lower capacity revenues in New York and uncleared capacity from the PJM incremental auctions. In 2021, we executed $50 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 4% to 7% when considering cross commodity hedges.  
On Slide 15, I'll give a brief update on Constellation's business and what we've seen to date on load performance. During the second quarter, commercial and industrial customer load was in line with our expectations. Load was within our down 9% to 15% projected range, although it varied from week to week. Our load forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged. As we get more information, we are getting a better handle on the impacts from COVID-19, which is helping us to monitor how specific regions, customers and industries are behaving with respect to COVID-19 impacts as they continue to evolve. Additionally, we are working with our large customers to better understand their load impacts and outlook. Even as we evolve to an ever-changing landscape, our focus remains on being strategic partners with our customers and providing clean energy products. We work with our customers by providing proactive analytics and insights on their current loads, tools to manage and optimize in real time and navigate emerging trends such as electrification impacts to their businesses, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. This partnership is key to our success and provides the most stability for our business via high retention rates and consistent margins.  
Moving on to Slide 16. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the pressures from COVID-19 as discussed in detail last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.5x and 2.0x when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the rating front, in July, Fitch affirmed our ratings and S&P took action to downgrade ComEd's issuer credit rating. However, S&P reaffirmed the senior secured and short-term ratings at ComEd, therefore, not impacting our anticipated cost of borrowing. Furthermore, S&P changed the ratings outlook for Exelon Corporate, PECO, Pepco Holdings, ComEd and ExGen to negative from stable. While we were disappointed in these actions, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings.  
We have successfully executed all of our planned long-term debt financings for the year. The 2020 financing plan was significantly accelerated to take advantage of attractive market conditions and provide ample short-term liquidity, leaving us well positioned for the balance of the year. The issuances in the second quarter were all meaningfully oversubscribed, and we secured record-setting low interest rates at the Utilities.  
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We continue to optimize the value of the Gen business by seeking fair compensation for our 0 emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets and maximizing their value through the Constellation avenue. We will sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics. We have remained committed to that and will not waiver. And we'll grow our dividend at this point right now annually at 5% through 2020.

And as you know, we've received this question many times over the last few months. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and it's a central tenant to our business and it has been quite frankly for a very long time. We go through a very rigorous planning process, and we disclose the results of that process each year on our fourth quarter call. And under that most recent plan, there is no equity issuance in the plan. Last month, we kicked off that process for our next plan that will take us through the end of this year. And as you can imagine, Shar, there's many variables that go into that process, market prices for power, obviously, treasury rates, our load forecast, our O&M projections, what our capital plans are, funding strategy when you think about debt. And obviously, we still have the FRR out there, and that will be taken into account. What I would say is we don't take any one of those variables in isolation. They obviously all work together to create the basis for our plan. We've been successful in -- with our strong balance sheet and growing our Utilities, and we've been harvesting the cash flow of ExGen to help do that. 
We also look at the levers we have, right? We've been pretty successful with our cost cuttings over the last 5 years, obviously. We've sold some assets. We look at alternative financing arrangements. And the last thing on that list is equity. But in our current plan, there is no need for equity. And as we move through the planning process and that takes us through the end of the year, we'll relay or communicate the outcome of that on our fourth quarter call."

I mean, in the past, it felt like you weren't confident if the ExGen business could be spun out without IG rating sufficient scale. With what we're seeing with IPPs eventually going IG, which would certainly alleviate the liquidity requirements, others looking at their own merchant fossil fleet as they de-risk, can you give us any refreshed thoughts on the Genco as a strategic fit within the portfolio over the long term? I guess do you now have some incremental confidence that the Genco business could eventually stand on its own without the support from corporate? I mean a transaction would obviously alleviate balance sheet concerns and in the valuation disconnect, and we've obviously seen a few players looking to simplify kind of their own structures. So whether we're talking about the entire fleet or simply the fossil fuel assets, has your strategic thinking kind of changed over the past, let's say, 12 months?"

We have enjoyed a period of time of free cash flow from the Genco that has allowed us to have a significant investment into the Utilities for the benefit of the customers over a period of time since our last review. As you can imagine, it's something that we always look at. And I understand the basis of the question with the recent announcements from 2 other companies on where they have decided to go. But right now, there's work to be done to create the certainty and the value of the cash flows that would be maintained to allow a company to either stand on its own or continue to support the growth of the other side of the business. And so we're in the middle of trying to work through a legislative strategy in Illinois. We're on firm ground in New York. I know there's work going on in New Jersey. We have to look at the value of the assets and what's going on in Maryland and what can be done there legislatively to compensate the assets for their low carbon output. So it's something we look at, and it's something that we think we have been very clear on from the beginning. And it's good to see other IPPs coming along and understanding the value of being investment grade and not having stressed balance sheets with commodity cyclicality like we see. But we think we can improve the value further and the strength further to be able to serve the states and the communities that we serve with good, well-paying jobs, a strong balance sheet. And then we will continue to assess to -- do the assets stay bolted together through a corporate holding company structure or is it better for all stakeholders involved to have some type of separation of the entities. 
The one thing I can tell you is there's an annual review on all the nonnuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue. And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else's portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we'll do that. There's assets that we'll shut down that aren't carrying their own weight. There are assets in New England that have a finite period of time under the ISO's regulation. And so there is a constant flux in our nonnuclear business that we'll continue to evaluate with our focus on strong balance sheet debt reduction and optimizing what we have on the balance sheet."

I'm going to let Joe Dominguez jump in on the second half of the question. He's here with us in the room. The first half of the question, does it affect the Exelon Generation's drive for legislation on changing the capacity market. There's an obvious issue that trust has been eroded. Although it's isolated to ComEd, it has effect on all the entities. And so there's been a lot of press reporting and there's been some disappointed stakeholders and is rightfully so. And so our job is to rebuild the trust of those that we serve and make sure that we can show that we have done a fantastic job, and Joe will cover some of this, in the investments that have been made at ComEd and what the rate structure is done for us. It has been totally super beneficial to the consumer. But there's a period of time where we're just going to have to continue outreach conversation and show our commitment to ethical behavior that doesn't compromise our integrity or the trustworthiness of us going forward. So we're still working to engage with stakeholders on a capacity market redesign. It's very critical for us to get it done. As you know, PJM is going to run an auction. And there's a strong sense from our analytic folks that the -- some of the nuclear units are not going to be picked up in that auction. Some are uneconomic at this point right now and some more may become uneconomic. And our commitment to you has always been if we can't find a way or path to profitability, we'll have to shut them down, which is a sad turn of events that will affect the state's goals on carbon reduction. It will severely affect the communities around the plants and the very high paying, critical jobs that those communities benefit from. 
So -- but it's an unfortunate thing. We apologize for what went on. We had a code of conduct that clearly defined the behaviors, but it wasn't enough. And so we've put controls in place to ensure it will never happen again. And we have to work with stakeholders, not only legislative and elected folks, but our customers and our other stakeholders and the communities that we serve to rebuild that trust. One thing I can tell you is this company is committed to doing the right thing for the communities that we serve, not only through philanthropic activities, but also volunteerism. I think you can look at us in all the communities we serve, and we're probably the strongest corporate partner out there, and we're going to continue that. And we know that we're only as good as a company as the communities that we serve. So that's what we've got to get back to. This is the most unfortunate thing to happen, not just because of time, it's because of trust. And it's because of a small amount of individuals making decisions that should not have been done, and it shouldn't have gone undetected. But with that said, we still remain confident that the consumers have been protected, served. And as you heard me say, we have lower rates and high reliability than we did 10 years ago. And so that's because we have a strong regulations -- a regulatory body that's focused on the same thing that we're focused on, is reliable, affordable, clean energy. 
With that, I'll let Joe talk about what his thoughts are on rates making and regulatory process."

I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a",758,"Thanks, Chris. I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a continuation of the formula with additional transparency or a return to traditional rate making. As both Chris and Joe talked about, we think the formula has provided enormous benefits to our customers. If you take a look at Page 7 on the deck, you see the key metrics, and you see all green for ComEd. But in a certain sense, that almost understates the performance at ComEd. We are not only top quartile in all those dimensions, we're actually top decile in all of those dimensions. And last year at ComEd, we had the best-performing year ever in the history of the company, over 110 years best-performing year. And as I look at the metrics at the close of July, we are tracking 20% better than last year in SAIFI and 11% better in CAIDI. So we've still got a number of months to go, but very, very proud of the team at ComEd and the operational performance. Customer satisfaction is highest it's ever been. We were J.D. Power's #1 Midwest utility at the end of 2019. We had never achieved that objective. So I focus on that because -- for 2 reasons. One, the transformation that's occurred at ComEd, and it's been recognized here. And second, we always tell you that from an Exelon perspective, and Chris says this virtually every call, that we think of good regulatory and political outcomes as being driven by good operational performance. And I think at ComEd, we can lay claim to perhaps having the best operational performance in the country. 
So we'll see what that looks like going forward. From comments from the governor's office that we've recently seen, it's clear that, at least from his perspective, the formula was tied to the transformation that's occurred, the investments in smart meters and other devices. And to the extent that there is a renewal or a new methodology that's installed, that's going to have to be related to a new policy objective, and that's tied up in a lot of the clean energy goals. But I guess from my perspective, Steve, whether we continue with the formula or whether we return to traditional rate making, I think the entire team at ComEd believes it's got to be constructive. And one reason we're confident in that is that there's been an evolution in Illinois. As we've been in the formula, Illinois policy for ratemaking has evolved. The state now uses forward-looking test years and the gas utilities have used that. That's been constructive. We're decoupled as a state. We have bad debt and other rider mechanisms that are strong and transparent and better than we were in 2011 when we first went to the formula. But I guess the biggest difference that I would point to is the operational performance between 2011 and now is so much better. If you take the thesis that operational performance drives regulatory results, then in a certain sense, the outcomes we were seeing in 2011 were driven by poor operational performance at ComEd. And today, that's a different story. And so the final point I would make is we've had an 8-year history of making the investments in underground cables and poles and including smart devices across our system. Not only -- the commission has seen that now for 8 years. What we'd be continuing, whether it's in a formula rate or traditional rate making, is those programs that have been wildly successful in terms of improving reliability, integrating clean energy, making the system more resilient in the face of climate change and doing all of that stuff and keeping customer bills low. As Chris said, our average bill today -- or I think Joe said this, is lower than it was 10 years ago. And in part, that's a story about wholesale power prices. But in big measure, it's about energy efficiency at ComEd and the overall efficiency of the organization. 
So the punchline for me is this, Steve. Regardless of whether we're in formula or not, I think we've got good alignment in terms of the investments we're making in the system. We're going to continue to make those prudent investments going forward, and I think the results are going to be constructive."

So Julien, let me answer the short question that you asked last first. Yes, if we return to traditional rate making, we would intend to file a rate case using a forward-looking test year, and that rate case would likely be filed in the first quarter of 2023. So that's number one. In terms of the franchise agreement, we've been through a process with the city where we've been meeting periodically just about every week, although that got interrupted a bit with COVID. We're making good progress, I thought, on the franchise agreement. Then we have the DPA. And we had a hearing last week with City Council and also some input from the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office indicated that from her perspective, 2 things need to happen before we could continue the conversation around the franchise agreement. One is we have to deal with the ethics reforms and the compliance mechanisms. And from my perspective, that is assuring the city that the measures we've taken are the appropriate ones and then having reporting requirements and other things with the city so that they understand that we're implementing those and that we're moving forward appropriately. The Mayor has a big ethics agenda, so we're going to embrace that ethics agenda. Here, the hiring of Dave Glockner, which we've talked about before, is quite an important piece. Dave has -- comes to us with an impeccable reputation. As many of you know, he came out of the U.S. Attorney's office, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division at that office for 11 years. But most importantly, and for folks outside of Northern Illinois, you don't see this, but Dave has an unbelievable reputation within the community. And for folks like the Mayor who have served in the U.S. Attorney's office as a colleague of Dave's, that's quite an important point. But we need to work through ensuring that we have a transparent mechanism of providing regular updates to the city in terms of the adherence to the new protocols that we've adopted. That's one piece of it. 
The Mayor has also indicated that we need to be committed to the goals of sustainability, to the goals of equitable and affordable energy for all customers in the city. And that's kind of the sweet spot of our strategy around electrification, around clean energy, energy efficiency, the many jobs programs we sponsor. So we look forward to a good conversation on that. There's a tangential issue relating to the franchise agreement that being the issue of the city's takeover or municipalization of the grid here in Chicago. We've spoken about that previously on this call. Commissioner Reynolds, who is leading for the city the negotiations with ComEd, testified at the hearing last week and indicated that the city will have a feasibility study out shortly on the possibility of municipalization. At least he indicated in his testimony that, that would -- that -- the view would be that, that would not be feasible. And there's a few big reasons for that. One is it's a $5 billion to $6 billion system and then the separation cost would be another $5 billion. So I think we'll tie together a few of these issues here. We need to assure the city of the reforms I've talked about. We'll have a conversation about the programs around clean energy, electrification, jobs programs, benefits to customers' affordability. And then I imagine we'll continue to have this backdrop of municipalization. But if the feasibility study comes out as Commissioner Reynolds indicated, I don't think that's going to necessarily be a pathway. But we have our work to do with the city. I'm confident we will get there. It may take a year or more to hash out. That's something Commissioner Reynolds indicated as well. But the way our franchise agreement works, and I've talked about this previously on this call, is that if it has not continued, it simply rolls over year-to-year on its own terms. It's like a lease in that sense where it just automatically renews year-to-year. So that's probably more than you wanted to hear, Julien, but that's the whole story on the franchise agreement."

We'll continue to challenge ourselves in that regard. There's other variables, too, right? We just talked about the Illinois legislation, what is the outcome of that. That will have a -- obviously be a binary impact. How much capital are we putting into our Utilities and what that looks like. And all of those things go into the -- to the decision-making. Chris talked about on economic assets and actions around those. We've clearly sold assets where we thought the market had higher values on them. We've looked at alternative financings and have used project financing. We did the securitization of the receivables at Constellation. So there's a lot of elements to it, Stephen. Some are kind of decisions we control. Others, we're part of and we're working on, and they build upon themselves. And ultimately, we -- our dividend, we have to make a recommendation to the Board at the end of this year, and we'll do that and determine how much capital we're putting in across our footprint.

I can tell you there's a significant effort and contingency planning going on within the generating company and the BSC, the Business Services Company. Now on -- if we maintain the fleet as we have it, how are we going to do it more economically, how are we using technology. Then a significant amount of work in the financial organization, HR, legal, other organizations to look at the world differently. And we'll announce our next round probably in third quarter -- fourth quarter. I'm looking at Dan to make sure I'm answering right because he's responsible for this, and he's waving his hands at me. So the fourth quarter call. But -- and we'll have a better picture of the future life of the nuclear fleet by that point. And if we are in the mode of unfortunately retiring plants, you can imagine that we'll have a significant reduction in the BSC overheads that could go back to the benefit of the customers from the modified Massachusetts formula. I wouldn't necessarily say it gives them more headroom to spend capital. We spend capital that is needed capital for reliability and customer service. But it should -- if the -- it should benefit the customers and take some of the overhead burden off of the utilities as we continue to refine how we can do work cheaper, better, faster, be very efficient, while serving the communities and the customers. 
There's one thing we've learned during this pandemic. Our real estate footprint may not have to be as big as it is right now. We are very efficiently working with about 17,000 people working remotely. And there's a group right now that's assessing not only a safe reentry around the 1st of the year for some portion of the workforce that's not on the line and maintaining the system or the plants or backing those individuals up. But we will take a very strong look at all expenses around and footprint around facilities. We've closed the books with the controller's organization, only having a few people come in for a couple of days. And audit has maintained its schedule and it's in-depth audit programs. So we're doing a lot, and we're learning a lot, and I think that's going to translate into more savings as we go forward. But looking at Dan again, I guess I'm not going to be committal on the time. But they're all squirming around me right now. I'll -- we'll be back to you at the end of the year with outlook."

And I appreciate everybody joining the call this morning and spending time with us.

And I appreciate everybody joining the call this morning and spending time with us.  
Starting off, as you've seen from our releases this morning, the GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 per share; on a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.55 per share. We had a great quarter, outperforming our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share due to achieving cost savings earlier than planned. Joe will get into it. Our load assumptions came out how we expected, but we've had excellent operations, but also have confronted some serious challenges throughout the quarter. First ComEd reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney's office in Illinois, that concludes -- includes a 3-year deferred prosecution agreement and a payment of $200 million, which ends the investigations into ComEd and Exelon. We have taken robust actions to identify and address deficiencies, including enhancing our compliance governance to prevent this type of conduct. We apologize for the past conduct that did not live up to our values. These new policies and oversight will ensure it won't happen again. We're extremely disappointed in the seriousness of the past misconduct, and we know many stakeholders understandably feel the same disappointment. We have -- you have our commitment that we will take every possible step to earn back the confidence and trust we have lost with others. This will not happen overnight and it will be a formidable task, but we are resolved to get there.  
Second, the country is addressing the important issues of racial and inequity and social justice, and we are doing so as well. Our employees and communities, our customers are diverse, and we have a critical leadership role in pursuing equity and fairness for all those who are facing ingrained injustice and discrimination. That means living our values both within and outside the walls of our company. Sponsoring job programs in underserved communities is a big focus of ours, developing a larger base of diverse suppliers in our footprint, supporting through philanthropic and volunteerism a wide variety of organizations, pursuing equity and economic development, making it clear what our values are through action and speaking up when we see injustice. Focus -- our focus on our values of respect, diversity and inclusion cannot waiver, and we know Black Lives Matter, all of our diverse communities matter, and we're standing to protect them and help serve them. We've doubled down on our work to support our diverse and underserved customers and communities since we all are impacted by continued inequity, and we must do more.  
Switching to the COVID issue. COVID-19 continues to impact our communities. We remain focused on safety of our employees, running our operations at the best-in-class levels and supporting our customers and communities, incorporate pandemic-related policies into our management model that keep our employees and our contractors safe, implementing responsible reentry plans that predict -- are predicting on key milestones that will ensure employees' safety and confidence that they can come back to the workplace. We've created contingency plans to monitor system configuration and allow us for rapid emergency response in storm or normal operations. And providing a deferred payment arrangement for residential and low income customers that are affected by the high rate of unemployment that we're dealing with in the communities that we serve.  
On the operational highlights. Operations are strong with the pandemic conditions and extreme storms across the territory. In early June, PECO faced its eighth largest storm in history, which brought sustained winds of over 40 miles per hour and gusts of more than 60 miles per hour. 400 customers were out within an hour of the storm beginning, and -- but we were able to restore 80% of those customers with widespread damage in 36 hours. We had already prepared and drilled new procedures for storm response during the pandemic. 80% of our back office storm rolls are performed now remotely. Within 48 hours, 3,750 contractors and mutual assistance personnel were safely on-site in the PECO region to restore customers and onboard -- they were onboarded electronically, which -- we continue to develop the techniques for that. Despite the pandemic and the active storm season, all Utilities are in top quartile for outage duration and outage frequency.  
Nuclear had its best second quarter capacity factor in more than a decade at 95.4%. Safety -- we safely completed in this quarter 5 [indiscernible]. There's been 8 for the year, and most ahead of schedule while protecting our employees and the contractors. Power dispatch match was 97.4%, and our renewable capture rate was 92.7%. So overall, very, very strong operational performance.  
We also continue to focus on our environmental stewardship. In July, we released our 2019 corporate sustainability report that shows the accomplishments that we made. Benchmarking air emissions report once again found Exelon as the lowest carbon emission rate of the top 20 investor-owned power producers, nearly 5x less than the #2 producer and the largest producer of carbon-free generation. In 2019, utility energy efficiency programs helped customers save 22.3 million megawatt hours and avoid 8.7 million metric tons of carbon. Exelon Utilities set a goal to electrify 30% of the vehicle fleet by 2025 and 50% by 2030, avoiding more than 65,000 metric tons of carbon from 2020 to 2030. We're committed to deliver affordable 0 emissions power in helping our customers and our community reduce the harmful emissions that there -- exist in their communities. These efforts are important to transition to a clean energy economy, but they are not enough to address the climate crisis. We continue to advocate for policies at the state and federal levels that will address the challenges.  
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Joe for the financial update."

We earned $0.53 per share on",1858,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.  
Turning to Slide 9. We earned $0.53 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.35 to $0.45 per share. Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.29 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven largely by ComEd formula rate timing and O&M timing, which was partially offset by the record-setting storm in the Philadelphia area, which cost for $0.04 per share to PECO.  
ExGen outperformed expectations for the second quarter, earning $0.26 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where we saw targeted savings for 2020 coming sooner than we originally budgeted. These savings were realized by lower outage cost, lower labor costs, travel and entertainment and training costs being lower as well. On the last call, we introduced -- we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID-19, which we expected would be more weighted to the back half of this year. The organization has been hard at work and is on track to achieve these savings in 2020, with some coming earlier than anticipated, as you can see in our second quarter results.  
During the quarter, load at the Utility and Constellation was in line with our expectations. For the third quarter, we expect earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share, and we are affirming our full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.10 per share.  
On Slide 10, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $0.55 per share in second quarter of this year was $0.05 per share lower than the second quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were down $0.10 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven primarily by storm costs at PECO, ComEd formula rate timing and higher bad debt expense, partially offset by favorable weather at PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.05 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and income taxes. This was partially offset by lower capacity revenue, primarily in PJM, and the impacts of COVID-19 on load and bad debt expense.  
Turning to Slide 11. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we remain in our consolidated 9% to 10% target range, with a 9.1% trailing 12-month ROE as of the second quarter. Earned ROEs for the Utilities remained above 9%, but dipped from last quarter by 60 basis points. The decline was primarily driven by lower earnings at PECO as a result of the storm -- June storm, higher bad debt at PECO and PHI and declining treasury yields, which impacted ComEd's ROE. As a reminder, this calculation is backward looking, so as we think about the next couple of quarters, you should expect to see some pressure on ROEs as we roll off the better pre-COVID-19 earnings quarters and carry the burdens of PECO's poor first quarter weather and second quarter storms as well as the impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. These headwinds are captured in our full year guidance, so you should have the financial impact already assumed.  
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger earned returns at the Utilities and supporting our growth targets.  
Turning to Slide 12. I since the last call, there were some important developments on the regulatory front. First, regulators in all our jurisdictions have approved COVID-19 recovery mechanisms. Second, BGE was the first utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan after getting the green light on this approach from the Maryland PSC in February. The filing will support planned capital investments from 2020 to 2023 as well investments made in late 2019 to maintain an increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution system. The critical infrastructure sector will be a key component to Maryland's economic recovery, and BGE has designed a multiyear energy infrastructure investment and customer relief plan to assist with the economic recovery. BGE will invest more than $5 billion to fund enhancements to the safety, reliability, security, resiliency and environmental attributes of the grid and improve customers' experience. BGE is expected to support more than 26,000 jobs and have at least $15 billion of economic impact over the 3-year period, which is critical as communities manage through the pandemic recovery. In conjunction with the filing, BGE will provide customer relief and assistance in 2020 to 2023 for limited income customers and small businesses. We expect an order this December.  
Third, in June, Pepco filed their multiyear plan enhanced proposal in D.C. with the PSC, addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current economic challenges. The enhanced plan would expand and establish a series of customer programs, targeting those that have been hardest hit, including small businesses, nonprofits and our residential customers. The flexibility of the multiyear plan structure provides Pepco the ability to offer these innovative adjustments in response to the pandemic. We expect an order by year-end.  
Fourth, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in modernizing the grid's reliability, resiliency and clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago.  
And finally, last month, Delmarva and Maryland received a final order for its distribution rate case. The Maryland commission approved the proposed order by the Public Utility Law Judge that recommended an $11.7 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increased Delmarva's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%. We believe it is recognition of strong performance and reliability and customer satisfaction. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 24 through 30 of the appendix.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the Utilities, investing $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $2.9 billion of capital into our Utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of all of our customers. Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, we are on track for the year. Today, I will discuss 2 projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  
The first project is Atlantic City Electric Moss Mills - Moss Farm (sic) [ Moss Mill - Motts Farm ] transmission line rebuild, which is a $69 million project to rebuild 15 miles of 69 kV transmission lines and poles. This project upgrades a critical transmission line that runs through the entire Northeastern portion of the Atlantic City territory in New Jersey spanning 3 different counties. Additionally, the Chestnut Neck Substation will be retired and replaced with a modernized mobile-ready substation, allowing for incremental flexibility.  
The second project is PECO's upland substation project in Philadelphia. The $68 million project includes replacement of an existing 75-year old substation with a new modernized substation and extension of 230 kV transmission lines and new 13 kV feeders into West Philadelphia. This project improves infrastructure that serves 10,000 customers in the Overbrook and Bala areas, including hospitals and universities. It will also enable customers to implement solar energy solutions. PECO engaged local diverse companies to participate with project implementation and construction, which provided approximately 250,000 construction hours.  
On Slide 14, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 since the last quarter. We executed new business consistent with our plan. In 2020, open gross margin is flat to the first quarter, and we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. In 2021, open gross margin increased by $200 million due to increasing power prices across most regions. This was offset by our hedges and lower capacity revenues in New York and uncleared capacity from the PJM incremental auctions. In 2021, we executed $50 million of power new business and $50 million of nonpower new business. We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 4% to 7% when considering cross commodity hedges.  
On Slide 15, I'll give a brief update on Constellation's business and what we've seen to date on load performance. During the second quarter, commercial and industrial customer load was in line with our expectations. Load was within our down 9% to 15% projected range, although it varied from week to week. Our load forecast for the remainder of the year is unchanged. As we get more information, we are getting a better handle on the impacts from COVID-19, which is helping us to monitor how specific regions, customers and industries are behaving with respect to COVID-19 impacts as they continue to evolve. Additionally, we are working with our large customers to better understand their load impacts and outlook. Even as we evolve to an ever-changing landscape, our focus remains on being strategic partners with our customers and providing clean energy products. We work with our customers by providing proactive analytics and insights on their current loads, tools to manage and optimize in real time and navigate emerging trends such as electrification impacts to their businesses, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. This partnership is key to our success and provides the most stability for our business via high retention rates and consistent margins.  
Moving on to Slide 16. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. This reflects the pressures from COVID-19 as discussed in detail last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.5x and 2.0x when excluding nonrecourse debt. On the rating front, in July, Fitch affirmed our ratings and S&P took action to downgrade ComEd's issuer credit rating. However, S&P reaffirmed the senior secured and short-term ratings at ComEd, therefore, not impacting our anticipated cost of borrowing. Furthermore, S&P changed the ratings outlook for Exelon Corporate, PECO, Pepco Holdings, ComEd and ExGen to negative from stable. While we were disappointed in these actions, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings.  
We have successfully executed all of our planned long-term debt financings for the year. The 2020 financing plan was significantly accelerated to take advantage of attractive market conditions and provide ample short-term liquidity, leaving us well positioned for the balance of the year. The issuances in the second quarter were all meaningfully oversubscribed, and we secured record-setting low interest rates at the Utilities.  
Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And as you know, we've received this question many times over the last few months. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to a strong investment-grade rating, and it's a central tenant to our business and it has been quite frankly for a very long time. We go through a very rigorous planning process, and we disclose the results of that process each year on our fourth quarter call. And under that most recent plan, there is no equity issuance in the plan. Last month, we kicked off that process for our next plan that will take us through the end of this year. And as you can imagine, Shar, there's many variables that go into that process, market prices for power, obviously, treasury rates, our load forecast, our O&M projections, what our capital plans are, funding strategy when you think about debt. And obviously, we still have the FRR out there, and that will be taken into account. What I would say is we don't take any one of those variables in isolation. They obviously all work together to create the basis for our plan. We've been successful in -- with our strong balance sheet and growing our Utilities, and we've been harvesting the cash flow of ExGen to help do that. 
We also look at the levers we have, right? We've been pretty successful with our cost cuttings over the last 5 years, obviously. We've sold some assets. We look at alternative financing arrangements. And the last thing on that list is equity. But in our current plan, there is no need for equity. And as we move through the planning process and that takes us through the end of the year, we'll relay or communicate the outcome of that on our fourth quarter call."

With what we're seeing with IPPs eventually going IG, which would certainly alleviate the liquidity requirements, others looking at their own merchant fossil fleet as they de-risk, can you give us any refreshed thoughts on the Genco as a strategic fit within the portfolio over the long term? I guess do you now have some incremental confidence that the Genco business could eventually stand on its own without the support from corporate? I mean a transaction would obviously alleviate balance sheet concerns and in the valuation disconnect, and we've obviously seen a few players looking to simplify kind of their own structures. So whether we're talking about the entire fleet or simply the fossil fuel assets, has your strategic thinking kind of changed over the past, let's say, 12 months?"

We have enjoyed a period of time of free cash flow from the Genco that has allowed us to have a significant investment into the Utilities for the benefit of the customers over a period of time since our last review. As you can imagine, it's something that we always look at. And I understand the basis of the question with the recent announcements from 2 other companies on where they have decided to go. But right now, there's work to be done to create the certainty and the value of the cash flows that would be maintained to allow a company to either stand on its own or continue to support the growth of the other side of the business. And so we're in the middle of trying to work through a legislative strategy in Illinois. We're on firm ground in New York. I know there's work going on in New Jersey. We have to look at the value of the assets and what's going on in Maryland and what can be done there legislatively to compensate the assets for their low carbon output. So it's something we look at, and it's something that we think we have been very clear on from the beginning. And it's good to see other IPPs coming along and understanding the value of being investment grade and not having stressed balance sheets with commodity cyclicality like we see. But we think we can improve the value further and the strength further to be able to serve the states and the communities that we serve with good, well-paying jobs, a strong balance sheet. And then we will continue to assess to -- do the assets stay bolted together through a corporate holding company structure or is it better for all stakeholders involved to have some type of separation of the entities. 
The one thing I can tell you is there's an annual review on all the nonnuclear assets to see if they propose more value to others than we have projected for ourselves, and that annual review will continue. And as we see assets that could perform better in somebody else's portfolio and we could monetize those assets, we'll do that. There's assets that we'll shut down that aren't carrying their own weight. There are assets in New England that have a finite period of time under the ISO's regulation. And so there is a constant flux in our nonnuclear business that we'll continue to evaluate with our focus on strong balance sheet debt reduction and optimizing what we have on the balance sheet."

I'm going to let Joe Dominguez jump in on the second half of the question. He's here with us in the room. The first half of the question, does it affect the Exelon Generation's drive for legislation on changing the capacity market. There's an obvious issue that trust has been eroded. Although it's isolated to ComEd, it has effect on all the entities. And so there's been a lot of press reporting and there's been some disappointed stakeholders and is rightfully so. And so our job is to rebuild the trust of those that we serve and make sure that we can show that we have done a fantastic job, and Joe will cover some of this, in the investments that have been made at ComEd and what the rate structure is done for us. It has been totally super beneficial to the consumer. But there's a period of time where we're just going to have to continue outreach conversation and show our commitment to ethical behavior that doesn't compromise our integrity or the trustworthiness of us going forward. So we're still working to engage with stakeholders on a capacity market redesign. It's very critical for us to get it done. As you know, PJM is going to run an auction. And there's a strong sense from our analytic folks that the -- some of the nuclear units are not going to be picked up in that auction. Some are uneconomic at this point right now and some more may become uneconomic. And our commitment to you has always been, if we can't find a way or path to profitability, we'll have to shut them down, which is a sad turn of events that will affect the state's goals on carbon reduction. It will severely affect the communities around the plants and the very high paying, critical jobs that those communities benefit from. 
So -- but it's an unfortunate thing. We apologize for what went on. We had a code of conduct that clearly defined the behaviors, but it wasn't enough. And so we've put controls in place to ensure it will never happen again. And we have to work with stakeholders, not only legislative and elected folks, but our customers and our other stakeholders and the communities that we serve to rebuild that trust. One thing I can tell you is this company is committed to doing the right thing for the communities that we serve, not only through philanthropic activities, but also volunteerism. I think you can look at us in all the communities we serve, and we're probably the strongest corporate partner out there, and we're going to continue that. And we know that we're only as good as a company as the communities that we serve. So that's what we've got to get back to. This is the most unfortunate thing to happen, not just because of time, it's because of trust. And it's because of a small amount of individuals making decisions that should not have been done, and it shouldn't have gone undetected. But with that said, we still remain confident that the consumers have been protected, served. And as you heard me say, we have lower rates and high reliability than we did 10 years ago. And so that's because we have a strong regulations -- a regulatory body that's focused on the same thing that we're focused on, is reliable, affordable, clean energy. 
With that, I'll let Joe talk about what his thoughts are on rates making and regulatory process."

I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a",758,"Thanks, Chris. I think -- Steve, I think Chris covered a lot of it, just to level set for the folks on the call. The formula rate continues through the end of 2022. So we'll -- we have some additional time to see what the future looks like, whether it's a continuation of the formula with additional transparency or a return to traditional rate making. As both Chris and Joe talked about, we think the formula has provided enormous benefits to our customers. If you take a look at Page 7 on the deck, you see the key metrics, and you see all green for ComEd. But in a certain sense, that almost understates the performance at ComEd. We are not only top quartile in all those dimensions, we're actually top decile in all of those dimensions. And last year at ComEd, we had the best-performing year ever in the history of the company, over 110 years best-performing year. And as I look at the metrics at the close of July, we are tracking 20% better than last year in SAIFI and 11% better in CAIDI. So we've still got a number of months to go, but very, very proud of the team at ComEd and the operational performance. Customer satisfaction is highest it's ever been. We were J.D. Power's #1 Midwest utility at the end of 2019. We had never achieved that objective. So I focus on that because -- for 2 reasons. One, the transformation that's occurred at ComEd, and it's been recognized here. And second, we always tell you that from an Exelon perspective, and Chris says this virtually every call, that we think of good regulatory and political outcomes as being driven by good operational performance. And I think at ComEd, we can lay claim to perhaps having the best operational performance in the country. 
So we'll see what that looks like going forward. From comments from the governor's office that we've recently seen, it's clear that, at least from his perspective, the formula was tied to the transformation that's occurred, the investments in smart meters and other devices. And to the extent that there is a renewal or a new methodology that's installed, that's going to have to be related to a new policy objective, and that's tied up in a lot of the clean energy goals. But I guess from my perspective, Steve, whether we continue with the formula or whether we return to traditional rate making, I think the entire team at ComEd believes it's got to be constructive. And one reason we're confident in that is that there's been an evolution in Illinois. As we've been in the formula, Illinois policy for ratemaking has evolved. The state now uses forward-looking test years and the gas utilities have used that. That's been constructive. We're decoupled as a state. We have bad debt and other rider mechanisms that are strong and transparent and better than we were in 2011 when we first went to the formula. But I guess the biggest difference that I would point to is the operational performance between 2011 and now is so much better. If you take the thesis that operational performance drives regulatory results, then in a certain sense, the outcomes we were seeing in 2011 were driven by poor operational performance at ComEd. And today, that's a different story. And so the final point I would make is we've had an 8-year history of making the investments in underground cables and poles and including smart devices across our system. Not only -- the commission has seen that now for 8 years. What we'd be continuing, whether it's in a formula rate or traditional rate making, is those programs that have been wildly successful in terms of improving reliability, integrating clean energy, making the system more resilient in the face of climate change and doing all of that stuff and keeping customer bills low. As Chris said, our average bill today -- or I think Joe said this, is lower than it was 10 years ago. And in part, that's a story about wholesale power prices. But in big measure, it's about energy efficiency at ComEd and the overall efficiency of the organization. 
So the punchline for me is this, Steve. Regardless of whether we're in formula or not, I think we've got good alignment in terms of the investments we're making in the system. We're going to continue to make those prudent investments going forward, and I think the results are going to be constructive."

So Julien, let me answer the short question that you asked last first. Yes, if we return to traditional rate making, we would intend to file a rate case using a forward-looking test year, and that rate case would likely be filed in the first quarter of 2023. So that's number one. In terms of the franchise agreement, we've been through a process with the city where we've been meeting periodically just about every week, although that got interrupted a bit with COVID. We're making good progress, I thought, on the franchise agreement. Then we have the DPA. And we had a hearing last week with City Council and also some input from the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office indicated that from her perspective, 2 things need to happen before we could continue the conversation around the franchise agreement. One is we have to deal with the ethics reforms and the compliance mechanisms. And from my perspective, that is assuring the city that the measures we've taken are the appropriate ones and then having reporting requirements and other things with the city so that they understand that we're implementing those and that we're moving forward appropriately. The Mayor has a big ethics agenda, so we're going to embrace that ethics agenda. Here, the hiring of Dave Glockner, which we've talked about before, is quite an important piece. Dave has -- comes to us with an impeccable reputation. As many of you know, he came out of the U.S. Attorney's office, serving as Chief of the Criminal Division at that office for 11 years. But most importantly, and for folks outside of Northern Illinois, you don't see this, but Dave has an unbelievable reputation within the community. And for folks like the Mayor who have served in the U.S. Attorney's office as a colleague of Dave's, that's quite an important point. But we need to work through ensuring that we have a transparent mechanism of providing regular updates to the city in terms of the adherence to the new protocols that we've adopted. That's one piece of it. 
The Mayor has also indicated that we need to be committed to the goals of sustainability, to the goals of equitable and affordable energy for all customers in the city. And that's kind of the sweet spot of our strategy around electrification, around clean energy, energy efficiency, the many jobs programs we sponsor. So we look forward to a good conversation on that. There's a tangential issue relating to the franchise agreement that being the issue of the city's takeover or municipalization of the grid here in Chicago. We've spoken about that previously on this call. Commissioner Reynolds, who is leading for the city the negotiations with ComEd, testified at the hearing last week and indicated that the city will have a feasibility study out shortly on the possibility of municipalization. At least he indicated in his testimony that, that would -- that -- the view would be that, that would not be feasible. And there's a few big reasons for that. One is it's a $5 billion to $6 billion system and then the separation cost would be another $5 billion. So I think we'll tie together a few of these issues here. We need to assure the city of the reforms I've talked about. We'll have a conversation about the programs around clean energy, electrification, jobs programs, benefits to customers' affordability. And then I imagine we'll continue to have this backdrop of municipalization. But if the feasibility study comes out as Commissioner Reynolds indicated, I don't think that's going to necessarily be a pathway. But we have our work to do with the city. I'm confident we will get there. It may take a year or more to hash out. That's something Commissioner Reynolds indicated as well. But the way our franchise agreement works, and I've talked about this previously on this call, is that if it has not continued, it simply rolls over year-to-year on its own terms. It's like a lease in that sense where it just automatically renews year-to-year. So that's probably more than you wanted to hear, Julien, but that's the whole story on the franchise agreement."

We'll continue to challenge ourselves in that regard. There's other variables, too, right? We just talked about the Illinois legislation, what is the outcome of that. That will have a -- obviously be a binary impact. How much capital are we putting into our Utilities and what that looks like? And all of those things go into the -- to the decision-making. Chris talked about on economic assets and actions around those. We've clearly sold assets where we thought the market had higher values on them. We've looked at alternative financings and have used project financing. We did the securitization of the receivables at Constellation. So there's a lot of elements to it, Stephen. Some are kind of decisions we control. Others, we're part of and we're working on, and they build upon themselves. And ultimately, we -- our dividend, we have to make a recommendation to the Board at the end of this year, and we'll do that and determine how much capital we're putting in across our footprint. And then from there, we'll see what the funding plan looks like."

I can tell you there's a significant effort and contingency planning going on within the generating company and the BSC, the Business Services Company. Now on -- if we maintain the fleet as we have it, how are we going to do it more economically, how are we using technology. Then a significant amount of work in the financial organization, HR, legal, other organizations to look at the world differently. And we'll announce our next round probably in third quarter -- fourth quarter. I'm looking at Dan to make sure I'm answering right because he's responsible for this and he's waving his hands at me. So the fourth quarter call. But -- and we'll have a better picture of the future life of the nuclear fleet by that point. And if we are in the mode of unfortunately retiring plants, you can imagine that we'll have a significant reduction in the BSC overheads that could go back to the benefit of the customers from the modified Massachusetts formula. I wouldn't necessarily say it gives them more headroom to spend capital. We spend capital that is needed capital for reliability and customer service. But it should -- if the -- it should benefit the customers and take some of the overhead burden off of the utilities as we continue to refine how we can do work cheaper, better, faster, be very efficient, while serving the communities and the customers. 
There's one thing we've learned during this pandemic. Our real estate footprint may not have to be as big as it is right now. We are very efficiently working with about 17,000 people working remotely. And there's a group right now that's assessing not only a safe reentry around the 1st of the year for some portion of the workforce that's not on the line and maintaining the system or the plants or backing those individuals up. But we will take a very strong look at all expenses around and footprint around facilities. We've closed the books with the controller's organization, only having a few people come in for a couple of days. And audit has maintained its schedule and it's in-depth audit programs. So we're doing a lot, and we're learning a lot, and I think that's going to translate into more savings as we go forward. But looking at Dan again, I guess I'm not going to be committal on the time. But they're all squirming around me right now. I'll -- we'll be back to you at the end of the year with outlook."

Our GAAP basis earned $0.51 per share and non-GAAP basis earned $1.04 per share. 
We did outperform our guidance that we had originally given at $0.80 to $0.90 per share due to some favorable weather and more cost savings coming through sooner than we anticipated Joe detail [Technical Difficulty] that I want to highlight. In August, we had a tropical storm that battered the East Coast with rain and strong winds, significant impacts to Marvin PECO. It was PECO's 10th largest storm on record following the 8th largest storm in June. 
Then a hurricane like tour through the ComEd service territory, spanning 13 tornadoes. Between the 2 storms, we had more than 1.5 customers lost power. We had more than 500 employees and contractors that were helping their sister utilities moving back and forth between the East and the West to try to respond to the needs of the customers. 
And despite the intensity, we were able to restore the power to our customers in record time due to the power of our Exelon Utilities platform. Our employees, quick response and collaboration made the difference for our customers. 
So I really want to thank our employees for their great work restoring service to customers during not just the pandemic but a very active storm season as we've seen. 
As I mentioned on the last call, Exelon is committed to our values of diversity, equality and inclusion. Part of this commitment calls on our businesses and our partners to recognize these values and include women and people of color in key roles on our accounts. 
For 10 years, we've recognized partners who have excelled in this area. This year, we've included 30 companies in banking, insurance, legal, investment, professional and IT services to our 2020 diversity and inclusion on the road. 
We also are committed to delivering clean energy in a clean energy future. Exelon Foundation and Exelon selected 10 startups as part of the first round of $20 million in climate change investment initiatives. Beyond the financial support, Exelon will mentor the start-ups on accessing capital, structuring the business, capital allocation and meeting the regulatory requirements. 
Through this program, the Foundation will invest early in stage startups, working on climate change, mitigating, adapting and resilience in our service territory. 50% are minority or women owned, 60% of the projects focus on greenhouse gas mitigation and the others are on resiliency and adapting to the changing climate environment that we're living in. 
These investments will bring us a step closer to a clean energy future by helping entrepreneurs translate their ideas for reversing climate change into practical solutions. Finally, we made the difficult decision to retire some economic generation stations. Mystic generation, gas-fired station in Boston will retire in 2024 when the cost service agreement expires. 
And very disappointingly, we announced our Dresden -- Byron and Dresden nuclear stations will retire in 2021. These plants produce 30% of the carbon-free electricity in Illinois. They provide over 1,500 good-paying full-time jobs, and they support 2,000 supplemental workers during refueling outages, most from local union halls, paying $63 million in taxes annually to support local schools, fire departments and other services in their community. 
Despite being among the most efficient, reliable units in the U.S. nuclear fleet, they face revenue shortfalls, declining energy prices, lack of capacity revenue and market rules that allow fossil plants to underbid clean energy resources in the PJM market auction. 
Given these losses, we have made a tough decision to shut these units down and give our employees and the host communities time to manage through the personal and economic challenges ahead. 
Without these plants and others at risk, customers will pay $483 million in increased annual energy cost under the PJM auction structure that is about to incur. The electric sector emissions will increase by 70% and instead of growing 0-carbon energy in Illinois to reach the state's goal of clean energy will fail -- fall decades behind. 
We continue to work with interested parties on the best way to achieve these state goals, but urgent action is needed. We have to protect our consumers from higher bills, our state from dirtier air and our communities from the loss of these irreplaceable power plants and the jobs that they create. 
Turning to operations, even with the pandemic conditions, extreme storms and record heat across our territories, all our utilities have achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency. 
Customer service remains at top quartile across all utilities with BGE, ComEd and PECO delivering service in top decile. 
Power dispatch match of 98.9% in renewable energy capture at 91.9%. The Constellation has also had a very strong quarter of execution, and as a result was able to increase the new business targets for the year that we talked about that trouble in the first quarter. 
The nuclear performance was excellent. The plants ran at 96% for the quarter. They led the nation in 0-carbon electricity production, producing almost 38 terawatt hours of emission-free generation. Like all over plants, Dresden and Byron ran at nearly full power through the hottest summer on record. 
Employees at Dresden and Byron are entirely focused on ensuring the reliability and safety of these plants through their retirement dates. The plants force retirement is simply hard to deal with, and it's a shame. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."

Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per sha",1805,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.04 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. 
A key driver in our quarterly EPS performance for both the second and third quarters has been success in managing costs. As you may recall, on our first quarter call, we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID. At that time, we expected our offices would reopen in late summer. Since then, we have pushed phase 1 of our reopening for remote-enabled workers until January of next year at the earliest. 
This change in expectations, along with the hard work of the organization, led to higher savings than originally anticipated. 
For the quarter, Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.57 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven primarily by favorable O&M and taxes, earlier recognition of bad debt regulatory assets and favorable summer weather in our nondecoupled jurisdictions. 
This was partially offset by costs related to tropical storm which hit the East Coast in August. 
ExGen outperformed expectations for the third quarter, earning $0.47 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where targeted savings exceeded our original expectations and were achieved sooner than planned. Additionally, favorable weather and lower cost to serve benefited our gross margin. 
On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.04 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less HoldCo earnings were up $0.01 per share compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution and transmission rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2019 as well as favorable weather at PECO. 
This was partially offset by storm costs at PHI and PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.11 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and higher capacity revenues. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are raising our 2020 EPS guidance range to $3 to $3.20 per share from $2.80 to $3.10 per share and are now comfortably within our original 2020 guidance range of $3 to $3.30 per share. When we revised guidance on the first quarter call, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the severity and the length of the impacts of COVID on our business. 
Our updated guidance considers the strong ExGen performance to date, our successful cost management as well as the favorable weather we saw in the third quarter. We are delivering on our financial commitments, and we are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end. 
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we have dipped slightly below our consolidated 9% to 10% target range with an 8.9% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. The 20 basis point decline from last quarter was primarily due to equity infusions at BG&E and ComEd to support capital investments. 
This calculation is backward-looking, so you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters. This is simply due to the roll-off of better pre-COVID-19 quarters, the burden of poor first quarter weather, summer storms and the continued impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. 
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering strong returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets. 
Turning to Slide 11. Since the last call, we had 2 major developments on the regulatory front. Pepco filed its first multiyear plan in Maryland, and PECO filed its first guest distribution case in 10 years. Pepco was the second utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan with BGE filing the first plan in May. 
The filing will support capital investments in the electric distribution system made during 2019 and '20 and planned investments through March of 2024. Pepco's planned investments will continue to improve reliability and customer service, advanced technologies and investments to modernize the distribution system, support state environmental goals and provide tools to assist customers in managing their energy use. 
The filing considers the current health emergency and economic challenges in Maryland, while allowing for timely recovery of our investments that benefit our customers. 
A few highlights from the filing include: flat distribution rates for the first 2 years of the plan, partially offset in year 3. 
Residential electric bills are projected to be lower in 2024 than they were in 2011. Recovery of electric vehicle program cost and COVID-19 costs and inclusion of tracking performance incentive mechanisms focused on system reliability, customer service and the environment. We expect an order in May of 2021. 
On September 30, PECO filed a gas distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $69 million for continued investments in its gas distribution system to maintain and increase safety, reliability and customer service. We expect an order in June of '21. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress, 2 of which expect orders on -- 2 of which we expect orders on this year. In October, hearings were conducted as part of BG&E's pending multiyear rate case. As a reminder, the filing supports planned capital investments from 2020 to '23 as well as investments made in late 2019 to maintain and increase reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution systems. We expect an order in December. 
Additionally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. On October 14, draft proposed orders were filed by ComEd, the ICC staff and intervenors as part of the case. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. 
Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investment in grid modernization and enabling clean energy, growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 27 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Utilities continue to deploy capital largely as planned for the year, investing $1.6 billion during the third quarter and year-to-date, we have spent $4.5 billion of capital at our utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our customers. 
Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, our capital plan is on track for the year. Today, I will talk about 2 projects that advance Exelon utility strategy. A key element of that strategy is involving our capabilities to anticipate and meet changing customer needs and expectations of the system. 
The first project is Pepco's streetlight modernization project in Maryland. This project includes conversion of approximately 66,000 existing streetlights to smart LEDs and integration with a central management system. The new streetlights will send automatic notifications to the central management system, improving outage response time, maintenance efficiency and customer billing accuracy. 
Additionally, LEDs improve light quality and benefit public safety and security. This project is included in the Pepco Maryland multiyear plan filing I discussed earlier. 
The second project is the Exelon Utilities Customer Information System upgrade, which was completed on time even though it was done almost fully remotely. This is a $130 million project to upgrade BG&E's customer care and billing system and implement Oracle's Customer Experience Service Cloud at BG&E, ComEd and PECO. This new system will provide operational efficiencies as well as improve customer satisfaction. 
It's simply 1 piece of an ongoing project across the utilities to transform the customer information system. These improvements will support a platform to enable future customer benefits. Improvements will include a more personalized customer experience allowing for more efficient issue resolution and a streamlined and simplified implementation of billing for new customer offerings, such as community solar where energy is produced at different locations than the customers' residents. 
Additionally, it will allow for faster implementation of new rate structures, bringing pricing for new services such as EV charging and storage pricing to market faster. 
Transitioning to Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging position at ExGen. Our disclosures now reflect the impacts of the planned retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants in September and November of 2021, respectively. 
For 2020, total gross margin is up $50 million. Open gross margin decreased $100 million, primarily due to lower spark spreads in ERCOT, partially offset by higher prices at NiHub and 
Our mark-to-market of hedges were up $250 million due to our hedge position, which offset the decrease in open gross margin including the execution of $150 million of power new business. We also executed $50 million in nonpower new business during the quarter. 
Based on the higher load volumes associated with favorable third quarter weather and lower cost to serve across the portfolio, we are raising our 2020 new business targets by $50 million. For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million driven by the retirements of Byron and Dresden nuclear plants, which is flowing through the open gross margin line. However, open gross margin is flat due to higher prices at West Hub, NiHub and New York Zone A. 
Mark-to-market of hedges was down $100 million due to our hedge position being down $150 million, offset by the execution of $50 million of power new business inside the quarter. 
As a reminder, the Byron and Dresden retirements are expected to be earnings and cash flow accretive. However, they are essentially flat in 2021 due to the timing of the retirements. The $150 million decrease in gross margin is offset by lower O&M, and depreciation and amortization totaling $150 million. Additionally, we remained slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 and by 2% to 5% when considering cross-commodity hedges. 
Our hedge percentages reflect the removal of Byron and Dresden in the fall of 2021. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect it to be at 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
On the ratings front, Moody affirmed its existing ratings for Exelon Corporation and ComEd in the third quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And I have to say that many editorials and others call what we're asking for is a bailout. It's not a bailout. We're the nuclear fleet is only 0-emitting fleet that does not get compensation towards value. So this is not a bailout. It's leveling the playing field. 
It comes across nice and political venues or editorial venues, but the last thing it is as a bailout, it's leveling the competitive field.

Before turning to Q&A, I want to comment on some recent news reports that Exelon is considering separating the Exelon Generation from the Utilities. As discussed recently on our last earnings call, we regularly evaluate whether our corporate structure best serves the interest of our communities, customers and our employees and also our investors. 
We would consider modifying that structure when we can create value and recognize those interests. The natural -- the nature of our business and the landscape that it's in has been evolving over the years. In addition, you've seen a number of competitive integrated companies in our sector that have shrunk considerably. 
Given those circumstances, a review of our corporate structure is underway, started earlier this year, and we have the help of outside advisors. As we continue this review, we focus on creating value, taking into account, as I've mentioned, all of our stakeholders: the investors, the employees, the customers and the communities we serve. So I want to emphasize that the separation of the companies would involve addressing some complex operational, financial and regulatory issues. 
No decision has been made, but we continue to do the work to determine the best outcome for our stakeholders, and we'll provide you an update on our progress on the next earnings call. So with that, operator, we can now open it up to questions."

I mean you can imagine, this is a complex combination of a competitive integrated. And I wouldn't get on the path of laying out each one of those, but I will tell you that when you start to look at the corporate center, splitting out the IP, splitting out the financials, splitting out the corporate organization, has a lot of design and we have to make sure we're not creating dissynergies, and we do that properly. 
There's other considerations that we have to make for the employees for the regulatory bodies to do that. And it's not an easy one. Many of the competitive integrated that have switched and split have not had the complex level of the integration or the size of the scale that we have. 
If you look at our -- we have the most premier retail and wholesale trading organization, nobody that has split had anything like that. So there's value being created, but there's expense there too. So we have to watch how we do it, make sure we do it properly. There's a lot to be said about what we do for the consumer and the 0-carbon market. You haven't seen anybody that has a 0-carbon fleet like ours split-off. You've seen coal plants, you've seen gas plants, you've seen gas infrastructure split-off. 
We have to make sure that when or if we do it, that we have the right compensation for the assets that are being spun-off. And that's not something that's been recognized by the regulators or the legislators of the administrations thus far. They recognize when they recognize solar, but they have not recognized nuclear. 
And if you look at just the state of Illinois right now, 60% of the generation is carbon-free. 90% of its nuclear, nuclear is the only one that's not compensated for its low carbon or 0 carbon elements. So there's a lot of different avenues we have to go down to to get this right. 
But as I said in the last call, the market is changing, and we have to figure out how we change with it."

Not going too far, but the Genco has done a lot. The business services organization is accelerating some stuff on technology and contracts and other things that would mitigate those costs when split. One thing about a competitive integrated, you get to use the Massachusetts modified model to spread the costs around. That's a revenue generated formula. 
We know if or when we do a split that, that goes away. And so we have to figure out how do we keep the financials right, keep the employee benefits programs in all the databases? I mean you can go through that list of all the complex things that we have to do. But we do understand that the regulators are not going to want to see an increase in costs because we split the company.

We hope they do it as a technology-neutral approach versus what some size of the house and the Senate have gone at technologies versus outcomes. But we'll have to see. We're still going to fight at the state level and the market level to make sure that we get the right valuation for our assets. 
We are the largest noncarbon-producing entity with no for those assets. So -- but like I said earlier, it's nice for editorial or an editor or a politician to say we're looking for a bailout. We're looking to be able to compete with the other noncarbon that people have decided to provide a payment valuation for that low carbon output. But when you look at the largest noncarbon-emitting source in the country and the largest noncarbon-emitting company in the country and they're competing against other resources that are getting compensated for the value of that, it's just frustrating.

Our GAAP basis earned $0.51 per share and non-GAAP basis earned $1.04 per share.  
We did outperform our guidance that we had originally given at $0.80 to $0.90 per share due to some favorable weather and more cost savings coming through sooner than we anticipated Joe is going to get into the detail [Technical Difficulty] that I want to highlight. In August, we had a tropical storm that battered the East Coast with rain and strong winds, significant impacts to ACE, Delmarva and PECO. It was PECO's 10th largest storm on record following the 8th largest storm in June. 
Then a hurricane-like derecho tore through the ComEd service territory, spawning 13 tornadoes. Between the 2 storms, we had more than 1.5 customers lost power. We had more than 500 employees and contractors that were helping their sister utilities moving back and forth between the East and the West to try to respond to the needs of the customers. 
And despite the intensity, we were able to restore the power to our customers in record time due to the power of our Exelon Utilities platform. Our employees' quick response and collaboration made the difference for our customers. So we really want to thank our employees for their great work restoring service to customers during, not just the pandemic, but a very active storm season as we've seen. 
As I mentioned on the last call, Exelon is committed to our values of diversity, equality and inclusion. Part of this commitment calls on our businesses and our partners to recognize these values and include women and people of color in key roles on our accounts. 
For 10 years, we've recognized partners who have excelled in this area. This year, we've included 30 companies in banking, insurance, legal, investment, professional and IT services to our 2020 diversity and inclusion honor roll.  
We also are committed to delivering clean energy in a clean-energy future. Exelon Foundation and Exelon selected 10 start-ups as part of the first round of $20 million in climate change investment initiatives. Beyond the financial support, Exelon will mentor the start-ups on accessing capital, structuring the business, capital allocation and meeting the regulatory requirements. 
Through this program, the Foundation will invest early in stage start-ups, working on climate change, mitigating, adapting and resilience in our service territory. 50% are minority or women owned, 60% of the projects focus on greenhouse gas mitigation and the others are on resiliency and adapting to the changing climate environment that we're living in.  
These investments will bring us a step closer to a clean-energy future by helping entrepreneurs translate their ideas for reversing climate change into practical solutions. Finally, we made the difficult decision to retire some uneconomic generation stations. Mystic generation, gas-fired station in Boston will retire in 2024 when the cost service agreement expires. 
And very disappointingly, we announced our Dresden -- Byron and Dresden nuclear stations will retire in 2021. These plants produce 30% of the carbon-free electricity in Illinois. They provide over 1,500 good-paying full-time jobs, and they support 2,000 supplemental workers during refueling outages, most from local union halls, paying $63 million in taxes annually to support local schools, fire departments and other services in their community.  
Despite being among the most efficient, reliable units in the U.S. nuclear fleet, they face revenue shortfalls, declining energy prices, lack of capacity revenue and market rules that allow fossil plants to underbid clean energy resources in the PJM market auction.  
Given these losses, we have made a tough decision to shut these units down and give our employees and the host communities time to manage through the personal and economic challenges ahead. 
Without these plants and others at risk, customers will pay $483 million in increased annual energy cost under the PJM auction structure that is about to incur. The electric sector emissions will increase by 70% and instead of growing 0-carbon energy in Illinois to reach the state's goal of clean energy will fail -- fall decades behind. 
We continue to work with interested parties on the best way to achieve these state goals, but urgent action is needed. We have to protect our consumers from higher bills, our state from dirtier air and our communities from the loss of these irreplaceable power plants and the jobs that they create. 
Turning to operations, even with the pandemic conditions, extreme storms and record heat across our territories, all our utilities have achieved first quartile operating performance in outage duration and frequency. 
Customer service remains at top quartile across all utilities with BGE, ComEd and PECO delivering service in top decile. 
Power dispatch match of 98.9% in renewable energy capture at 91.9%. The Constellation has also had a very strong quarter of execution, and as a result was able to increase the new business targets for the year that we talked about at trouble in the first quarter.  
The nuclear performance was excellent. The plants ran at 96% for the quarter. They led the nation in 0-carbon electricity production, producing almost 38 terawatt hours of emission-free generation. Like all of our plants, Dresden and Byron ran at nearly full power through the hottest summer on record. 
Employees at Dresden and Byron are entirely focused on ensuring the reliability and safety of these plants through their retirement dates. The plants' forced retirement is simply hard to deal with, and it's a shame.  
I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update."
296181,692494589,2127284,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance. Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per sha",1809,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2020 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.51 per share on a GAAP basis and $1.04 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share.  
A key driver in our quarterly EPS performance for both the second and third quarters has been success in managing costs. As you may recall, on our first quarter call, we announced $250 million of savings across the organization to help offset the impacts of COVID. At that time, we expected our offices would reopen in late summer. Since then, we have pushed phase 1 of our reopening for remote-enabled workers until January of next year at the earliest.  
This change in expectations, along with the hard work of the organization, led to higher savings than originally anticipated. 
For the quarter, Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $0.57 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher relative to expectations, driven primarily by favorable O&M and taxes, earlier recognition of bad debt regulatory assets and favorable summer weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions. 
This was partially offset by costs related to tropical storm Isis, which hit the East Coast in August. 
ExGen outperformed expectations for the third quarter, earning $0.47 per share. The upside was largely driven by lower O&M, where targeted savings exceeded our original expectations and were achieved sooner than planned. Additionally, favorable weather and lower cost to serve benefited our gross margin. 
On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter earnings walk. The $1.04 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter of 2019. Exelon Utilities less Holdco earnings were up $0.01 per share compared to last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution and transmission rates associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2019 as well as favorable weather at PECO. 
This was partially offset by storm costs at PHI and PECO. ExGen's earnings were up $0.11 per share compared with last year, benefiting from lower O&M and higher capacity revenues. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are raising our 2020 EPS guidance range to $3 to $3.20 per share from $2.80 to $3.10 per share and are now comfortably within our original 2020 guidance range of $3 to $3.30 per share. When we revised guidance on the first quarter call, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the severity and the length of the impacts of COVID on our business. 
Our updated guidance considers the strong ExGen performance to date, our successful cost management as well as the favorable weather we saw in the third quarter. We are delivering on our financial commitments, and we are confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end.  
Moving to Slide 10. Looking at our Utility returns on a consolidated basis, we have dipped slightly below our consolidated 9% to 10% target range with an 8.9% trailing 12-month ROE as of the third quarter. The 20 basis point decline from last quarter was primarily due to equity infusions at BGE and ComEd to support capital investments. 
This calculation is backward-looking, so you should continue to see some pressure on ROEs over the next couple of quarters. This is simply due to the roll-off of better pre-COVID-19 quarters, the burden of poor first quarter weather, summer storms and the continued impact of lower treasuries on ComEd. 
Looking further into the future, we remain focused on delivering stronger returns at the utilities and supporting our growth targets. 
Turning to Slide 11. Since the last call, we had 2 major developments on the regulatory front. Pepco filed its first multiyear plan in Maryland, and PECO filed its first guest distribution case in 10 years. Pepco was the second utility in Maryland to file a multiyear plan with BGE filing the first plan in May. 
The filing will support capital investments in the electric distribution system made during 2019 and '20 and planned investments through March of 2024. Pepco's planned investments will continue to improve reliability and customer service, advanced technologies and investments to modernize the distribution system, support state environmental goals and provide tools to assist customers in managing their energy use. 
The filing considers the current health emergency and economic challenges in Maryland, while allowing for timely recovery of our investments that benefit our customers. 
A few highlights from the filing include flat distribution rates for the first 2 years of the plan, partially offset in year 3. Residential electric bills are projected to be lower in 2024 than they were in 2011. Recovery of electric vehicle program cost and COVID-19 costs and inclusion of tracking performance incentive mechanisms focused on system reliability, customer service and the environment. We expect an order in May of 2021. 
On September 30, PECO filed a gas distribution case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. PECO is seeking a revenue increase of $69 million for continued investments in its gas distribution system to maintain and increase safety, reliability and customer service. We expect an order in June of '21. 
We also have several rate cases still in progress, 2 of which expect orders on -- 2 of which we expect orders on this year. In October, evidentiary hearings were conducted as part of BGE's pending multiyear rate case. As a reminder, the filing supports planned capital investments from 2020 to '23 as well as investments made in late 2019 to maintain and increased reliability and benefit customer service for our electric and gas distribution systems. We expect an order in December. 
Additionally, ComEd's annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. On October 14, draft proposed orders were filed by ComEd, the ICC staff and intervenors as part of the case. This filing requests a reduction in delivery rates for the third year in a row and the fifth decrease in 10 years. 
Since the formula rate has been in place, ComEd's investments in grid modernization and enabling clean energy growth have improved reliability by 70% while keeping bills lower than they were nearly a decade ago. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 20 through 27 of the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 12. The Utilities continue to deploy capital largely as planned for the year, investing $1.6 billion during the third quarter and year-to-date, we have spent $4.5 billion of capital at our utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our customers. 
Despite some early challenges from the pandemic, our capital plan is on track for the year. Today, I will talk about 2 projects that advance Exelon utility strategy. A key element of that strategy is involving our capabilities to anticipate and meet changing customer needs and expectations of the system. 
The first project is Pepco's streetlight modernization project in Maryland. This project includes conversion of approximately 66,000 existing streetlights to smart LEDs and integration with a central management system. The new streetlights will send automatic notifications to the central management system, improving outage response time, maintenance efficiency and customer billing accuracy. 
Additionally, LEDs improve light quality and benefit public safety and security. This project is included in the Pepco Maryland multiyear plan filing I discussed earlier. 
The second project is the Exelon Utilities' customer information system upgrade, which was completed on time even though it was done almost fully remotely. This is a $130 million project to upgrade BGE's customer care and billing system and implement Oracle's customer experience service cloud at BGE, ComEd and PECO. This new system will provide operational efficiencies as well as improve customer satisfaction. 
It's simply one piece of an ongoing project across the utilities to transform the customer information system. These improvements will support a platform to enable future customer benefits. Improvements will include a more personalized customer experience allowing for more efficient issue resolution and a streamlined and simplified implementation of billing for new customer offerings, such as community solar where energy is produced at different locations than the customers' residents. 
Additionally, it will allow for faster implementation of new rate structures, bringing pricing for new services such as EV charging and storage pricing to market faster. 
Transitioning to Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging position at ExGen. Our disclosures now reflect the impacts of the planned retirements of the Byron and Dresden nuclear plants in September and November of 2021, respectively. 
For 2020, total gross margin is up $50 million. Open gross margin decreased $100 million, primarily due to lower spark spreads in ERCOT, partially offset by higher prices at NiHub and West Hub.
Our mark-to-market of hedges were up $250 million due to our hedge position, which offset the decrease in open gross margin including the execution of $150 million of Power New Business. We also executed $50 million in non-Power New Business during the quarter. 
Based on the higher load volumes associated with favorable third quarter weather and lower cost to serve across the portfolio, we are raising our 2020 new business targets by $50 million. For 2021, total gross margin is down $150 million driven by the retirements of Byron and Dresden nuclear plants, which is flowing through the open gross margin line. However, open gross margin is flat due to higher prices at West Hub, NiHub and New York Zone A. 
Mark-to-market of hedges was down $100 million due to our hedge position being down $150 million, offset by the execution of $50 million of Power New Business inside the quarter. 
As a reminder, the Byron and Dresden retirements are expected to be earnings and cash flow accretive. However, they are essentially flat in 2021 due to the timing of the retirements. The $150 million decrease in gross margin is offset by lower O&M, TOTI and depreciation and amortization totaling $150 million. Additionally, we remained slightly behind our ratable hedging program in 2021 by 2% to 5% when considering cross-commodity hedges. 
Our hedge percentages reflect the removal of Byron and Dresden in the fall of 2021. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Our consolidated FFO to debt is projected to be 18% for 2020, consistent with last quarter. Looking at ExGen, we are ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of 3.0x. For 2020, we expect it to be at 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9x when excluding nonrecourse debt. 
On the ratings front, Moody affirmed its existing ratings for Exelon Corporation and ComEd in the third quarter. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings. 
Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

I want to close as we do each one of these calls, with our value proposition. We are focused on growing our utilities, and now we're targeting a 7.3% rate base growth with a 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2023. We will use the free cash flow from the Genco to support the utility growth, pay down Genco debt and support the external dividend. 
We continue to optimize the value of Exelon Generation business by seeking fair compensation for our 0-emitting generation. And I have to say that many editorials and others call what we're asking for as a bailout. It's not a bailout. We're the -- the nuclear fleet is only 0-emitting fleet that does not get compensation towards value. So this is not a bailout. It's leveling the playing field. 
It comes across nice and political venues or editorial venues, but the last thing it is, is a bailout, it's leveling the competitive field. We'll continue closing uneconomic plants, like we announced the retirement of Dresden, Byron and Mystic, monetizing these assets and maximizing the value through Constellation, retail and wholesale. We'll continue to sustain investment-grade credit metrics and maintain a strong balance sheet while -- and have grown our dividend annually at 5% through 2020. 
Before turning to Q&A, I want to comment on some recent news reports that Exelon is considering separating the Exelon Generation from the Utilities. As discussed recently on our last earnings call, we regularly evaluate whether our corporate structure best serves the interest of our communities, customers and our employees and also our investors. We would consider modifying that structure when we can create value and recognize those interests. The natural -- the nature of our business and the landscape that it's in has been evolving over the years. In addition, you've seen a number of competitive integrated companies in our sector that have shrunk considerably. 
Given those circumstances, a review of our corporate structure is underway, started earlier this year, and we have the help of outside advisers. As we continue this review, we focus on creating value, taking into account, as I've mentioned, all of our stakeholders: the investors, the employees, the customers and the communities we serve. So I want to emphasize that the separation of the companies would involve addressing some complex operational, financial and regulatory issues. 
No decision has been made, but we continue to do the work to determine the best outcome for our stakeholders, and we'll provide you an update on our progress on the next earnings call. So with that, operator, we can now open it up to questions."

I mean you can imagine, this is a complex combination of a competitive integrated. And I wouldn't get on the path of laying out each one of those, but I will tell you that when you start to look at the corporate center, splitting out the IP, splitting out the financials, splitting out the corporate organization, has a lot of design that we have to make sure we're not creating these in-synergies (sic) [ dissynergies ], and we do that properly. 
There's other considerations that we have to make for the employees, for the regulatory bodies to do that and it's not an easy one. Many of the competitive integrateds that have switched and split have not had the complex level of the integration or the size of the scale that we have. 
If you look at our -- we have the most premier retail and wholesale trading organization, nobody that has split had anything like that. So there's value being created, but there's expense there too. So we have to watch how we do it, make sure we do it properly. There's a lot to be said about what we do for the consumer and the 0-carbon market. You haven't seen anybody that has a 0-carbon fleet like ours split-off. You've seen coal plants, you've seen gas plants, you've seen gas infrastructure split-off. 
We have to make sure that when or if we do it, that we have the right compensation for the assets that are being spun-off. And that's not something that's been recognized by the regulators or the legislators or the administrations thus far. They recognize when they recognize solar, but they have not recognized nuclear. 
And if you look at just the state of Illinois right now, 60% of the generation is carbon-free. 90% of it's nuclear. Nuclear is the only one that's not compensated for its low carbon or 0 carbon elements. So there's a lot of different avenues we have to go down to, to get this right. 
But as I said in the last call, the market's changing, and we have to figure out how we change with it."

Right now, I think it's probably a little early to start making calls around balance sheet and capital allocation decisions. You could imagine amongst all the factors we're considering with this review, looking at the credit metrics, working with the agencies, thinking through that is going to be an aspect. 
Thinking about how ExGen would use the free cash flow that's been funding the Utilities to be part of it, thinking about how the Utilities can fund their growth, both with their internally generated and retained cash flows, but also other sources of funding will all go into the decision. 
But those are -- a number of factors will go into our analysis over the coming months."

And these are not the first nuclear plants we've had to shut down. Some will say that we'll -- we make enough money already, we should not shut them down, but that's just not the way businesses work. And so you have to work through the reaction. 
And the 2 major constituents that are going to feel the pain here with us shutting these units down, because we're losing so much money, are the employees and the communities. If you look at the taxes and what we provide in the community as far as employment in commerce and -- it's not easy. And so you can imagine those communities are trying to figure out what they can do to support us staying -- keeping those plants open. 
But haven't heard a lot from the legislative side. And I'll let Kathleen and Bill jump in on that side."

But until the legislature is back in session, we won't have a sense of where that's going. 
But I agree with you that the impact, both on the employees and the communities around the plants, as well as the sort of broader communities in Illinois are watching this because to the extent these plants shut down, what will happen is fossil plants will ramp up, and that will affect communities around the state that are already struggling with air pollution and the effects of COVID. So a lot of folks are watching it for sure."

We hope they do it as a technology-neutral approach versus what some size of the house and the Senate have gone at technologies versus outcomes. But we'll have to see. We're still going to fight at the state level and the market level to make sure that we get the right valuation for our assets. 
We are the largest noncarbon-producing entity with no remunerations for those assets. So -- but like I said earlier, it's nice for editorial or an editor or a politician to say we're looking for a bailout. We're looking to be able to compete with the other noncarbon that people have decided to provide a payment, a valuation for that low carbon output. But when you look at the largest noncarbon-emitting source in the country and the largest noncarbon-emitting company in the country and they're competing against other resources that are getting compensated for the value of that, it is just frustrating.
