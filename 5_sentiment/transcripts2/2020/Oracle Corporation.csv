22247,657404914,1936013,"Oracle Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 12, 2020",2020-03-12,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. B",1128,"Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue. 
It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5% and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year. 
We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base. 
As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues. 
Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. 
Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. 
Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers, and as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4. 
So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year. 
In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I'm going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary. 
My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure.

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers. 
Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of the ERP cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday. 
And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion sales, e-commerce and configure price quote. 
Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion, EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion supply chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. Reco bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM. 
We had a number of SCMs, a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion supply chain. National Oil Wells bought Fusion supply chain. bought supply chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought supply chain. Citrus World brought supply chain. Conagra, supply chain. UC Health bought supply chain. National Convenience Distributors bought supply chain and so did Total SSA buy supply chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite. 
CSX bought HCM, UC Health bought HCM, along with supply chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and supply chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM cloud implementation. Keurig Dr. Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Microfocus bought Fusion marketing, Fusion service, Fusion sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion marketing and Fusion service. 
Comcast, excuse me, Comcast bought Fusion sales. Cargill bought Fusion marketing. Thermo Fisher bought configure price quote. Motorola bought configure price quote. And [indiscernible] bought Fusion marketing, Fusion sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business. 
I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud. 
I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions, a very big commitment from Nomura. 
Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our cloud customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. Workforce software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance in the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them. 
GAP has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint. 
This one is really interesting. Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (sic) [ Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ] 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite. 
Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to the public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM P Series to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud and customer. 
Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins. And with that, I'll turn it back to Safra."

Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers. 
In addition, the database itself database, license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that, that is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that?"

So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's 1 big thing. 
But another thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores, we do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2. 
So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock-defined that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business and we expect this trend to continue."

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of, we think we have the best technology.

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of, we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, ""I don't think they have a better UI,"" and you just talked to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, ""Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17."" 
And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an Autonomous Database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment. 
And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic."

So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what -- at least what this quarter did and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more. 
So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business."

One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate. 
The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site. 
So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more are provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation."

And we're talking about American companies, Asian companies, German companies, large German companies that are giving us divisions to put Fusion into. And there is -- 1 company has given us multiple divisions because the question they're trying to answer is, ""Can I replace all of SAP throughout my company with Fusion? And you're just doing 1 division and my company isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company."" 
So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. It is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming. We program in Java but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us and I have never seen, except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database. And Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand. 
I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be."

As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars.",1129,"Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. 
As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue. 
It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5% and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year. 
We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base. 
As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues. 
Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. 
Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. 
Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4. 
So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year. 
In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary. 
My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. 
Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure.

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers. 
Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday. 
And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote. 
Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM. 
We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite. 
CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion service. 
Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And [ Participia ] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business. 
I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud. 
I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura. 
Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them. 
Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint. 
This one is really interesting. Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (sic) [ Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ] 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite. 
Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer. 
Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Safra (sic) [ Ken ]."

Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers. 
In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that, that is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that."

So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing. 
But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores, we do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2. 
So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue."

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology.

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, ""I don't think they have a better UI,"" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, ""Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17."" 
And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment. 
And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic."

So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large p",291,"Yes. So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what -- at least what this quarter did and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more. 
So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong, and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business."

One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate. 
The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site. 
So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation."

So our business has hit an obvious inflection. I've mentioned that it would accelerate in the second half. I never would have imagined that we would have the kind of reaction worldwide by companies and governments. So I really -- I've done my best at modeling what Q4 will look like. To the extent that next year is -- that this stabilizes, I believe we will be just continuing on in our -- we've changed our model and it's becoming obvious.

And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company."" 
So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming. We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be."

22247,657404914,1936771,"Oracle Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 12, 2020",2020-03-12,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars.",1129,"Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. 
As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue. 
It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5%, and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year. 
We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base. 
As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues. 
Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. 
Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. 
Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4. 
So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year. 
In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary. 
My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.
Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."
22247,657404914,1936771,"Oracle Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 12, 2020",2020-03-12,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Safra. There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure.

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers. 
Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday. 
And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote. 
Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM. 
We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite. 
CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion service. 
Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And [ Participia ] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business. 
I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud. 
I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura. 
Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them. 
Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint. 
This one is really interesting. Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (sic) [ Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ] 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite. 
Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer. 
Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Safra (sic) [ Ken ]."

Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers. 
In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that. That is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that."

So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing. 
But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores. We do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2. 
So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue."

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, ""I don't think they have a better UI,"" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, ""Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17."" 
And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment. 
And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic."

So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what this quarter did, and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more. 
So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong, and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business."

One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate. 
The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site. 
So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation."

And it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with. 
So our business has hit an obvious inflection. I've mentioned that it would accelerate in the second half. I never would have imagined that we would have the kind of reaction worldwide by companies and governments. So I really -- I've done my best at modeling what Q4 will look like. To the extent that next year is -- that this stabilizes, I believe we will be just continuing on in our -- we've changed our model and it's becoming obvious. So I think our stock is obviously a bargain. It was a bargain before, and we are authorized to buy back, and we will let you know after we have done it."

And we're talking about American companies, Asian companies, German companies, large German companies that are giving us divisions to put Fusion into. And there is -- one company has given us multiple divisions because the question they're trying to answer is, ""Can I replace all of SAP throughout my company with Fusion? And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company."" 
So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming. We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be."

As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars.",1129,"Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. 
As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue. 
It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5%, and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year. 
We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base. 
As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues. 
Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. 
Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. 
Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. 
Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4. 
So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year. 
In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue. 
My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary. 
My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.
Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

There are 2 key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers. 
Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday. 
And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion Service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote. 
Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM. 
We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite. 
CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion Service. 
Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And [ Participia ] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business. 
I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud. 
I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura. 
Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them. 
Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint. 
This one is really interesting. Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (sic) [ Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ] 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite. 
Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer. 
Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Safra (sic) [ Ken ]."

Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers. 
In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that. That is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that."

So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing. 
But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores. We do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2. 
So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue."

Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, ""I don't think they have a better UI,"" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, ""Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17."" 
And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment. 
And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic."

So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large p",287,"Yes. So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what this quarter did, and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more. 
So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong, and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business."

One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate. 
The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site. 
So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation."

And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company."" 
So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming. We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be."

Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC and other health authorities around the world or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers and I think we are much closer to them as a result. 
There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology. 
Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, we're also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud. 
COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility, social and machine learning built in. 
Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative. 
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35% and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%. 
As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year, and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter and the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%, below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. 
Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion. During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency. 
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. 
Now before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings. 
We are confident in our growth because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in 1 of 3 distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate. The declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward. 
Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for one, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion. 
Third, we have 4 decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud at Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows. 
Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These 2 are getting to be a large number. 
Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart. In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies, favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year. 
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1. 
Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency, and assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. 
Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."
22247,671196867,2019037,"Oracle Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2020",2020-06-16,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning. Oracle Cloud Infrastru",2513,"Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning. 
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's [ generation 1 ] cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and thus eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal. 
The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change, and it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. 
Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides [ 99.995% ] availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. Furthermore, soon, all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular -- all about popular things truly serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. 
Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity, and even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud. 
Okay. The Oracle public cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud at Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering. 
To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom. And that's the other -- and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about. 
Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom's services has increased almost 20x since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew. 
Okay. Another win in addition to Zoom, 8x8, a great example of our sales process. The customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS -- moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal for 8x8 and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users. 
Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a 3-year contract. They built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud at Customer data center in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI public cloud services to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 public cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements. 
Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest -- world's ninth largest investment firm, plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications. Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud at customer. In the customer's own words, ""The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud at Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50% while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud at Customer, our team could save time and effort and focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database."" 
Quest Diagnostics. Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing, and they continue to invest in the Oracle cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud at Customer environment so that the company could migrate its MyQuest portal in anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business business functions. 
Another win, Santander Bank. Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud at Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation. Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's public cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and autonomous data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment. 
Verizon Business Group, a 4-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission- and business-critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 public cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPS, I/Os per second with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata cloud services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle public cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle. 
Another win, Cybereason, a 4-year contract. Using the OCI public cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with endpoint protection response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's BareMetal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics. 
Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high-performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI public cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year. 
Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a 3-year contract. Moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 public cloud, including a 34,000-user e-business suite application with the goal of lowering costs while improving security, reliability and performance. This win is open doors to the next phase of SGS's transition to the public cloud, focused on peering Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 public cloud. 
Another win, Synacor, 3-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shut down a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. 
Sky.One, a 3-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISV that again has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle cloud. 
Another one, another win for Infrastructure. Manappuram Finance in India, a 5-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle public cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center. With our newly launched hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site. And I'll stop with -- and the last infrastructure win I'll talk about is Altair, a 3-year contract, 5x the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI. 
There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins. 
Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader, with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago. 
Workday has a cloud ERP system but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions. We've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player. 
Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic. First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries, with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over 2 million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system. 
Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me, go look at the reports. They're online. Okay. 
So where we really distinguished ourselves in addition to capabilities and also other things was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report, look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top, and Workday is right in the middle with 3.0 far behind us. 
Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR and payroll system. All right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting. 
Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP and EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing an Oracle Fusion ERP. 
A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations. 
Another -- a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management. 
A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees in multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide-ranging program to modernize their corporate systems and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating costs. 
Another win in the quarter, ERP win in the quarter, was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia. Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins. I'm going to move to HCM wins. 
Okay. First, we won Kroger. North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from the smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application. Chatbox integrated into -- into HCM and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle voice digital assistant. You can do a lot of things, expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone, makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle voice digital assistant. 
Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM. A very large U.S. managed health care company. They acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce. Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm not going to -- I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra."

It's not -- I mean, it's great we have Verizon",453,"Well, I think what we're seeing is now that some people are actually trying -- the people -- the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business of providing their application. It's not -- I mean, it's great we have Verizon. We have end user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. 
Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where there -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud. 
Not everyone believes that -- most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest-cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle, and we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. 
So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, ""Hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger, so they must be better."" Once they look, we win. And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. 
We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in. We've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS, and we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth."

So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud, and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in a public cloud. And we had this",483,"Okay. So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud, and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in a public cloud. And we had this huge installed base. We have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle database. But that's sitting on-premise.  
And the large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database. The only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud at Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing. 
So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud at Customer Exadata -- Exadata Cloud at Customer service offering. And so now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise can now use Cloud at Customer. 
And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying public cloud except we put the database cloud, the Cloud at Customer in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- it's attached to our public cloud and we manage it for you. 
Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers have no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. 
And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just works. So we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of coexistence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer."

So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. 
Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that are -- that use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud. And so we've been incredibly successful with the old base and all that. In addition, the e-business suite customers, which is a massive installed base, has only recently started to upgrade, and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financial, now they're really starting as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that. 
And one of the things, by the way, that was very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers and they wanted to -- they like having a suite. They wanted a full suite, of course, our financials and HCM. But in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product, and now we have many references in supply chain, of course, including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. 
Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers start with us, many of our customers grow over time. So they'll start with some module. And year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some roll in additional capabilities. 
And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionality can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So we have a lot of momentum right now in this business."

I think Safra is absolutely -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. We were -- I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses, and this is another example where we executed very well there. 
I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline, that we don't care much about. I mean, we don't care that the SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. There are a bunch of businesses, we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline, that were lower-margin businesses. And we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our Infrastructure, OCI Gen2 Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products. 
So as some of our lower-margin businesses get smaller and our higher-margin businesses get bigger, it's really -- what's going on is a mix shift, a fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though over the -- if you look at Oracle, and by and large, over the last several years, someone will say, ""Golly, I mean, their top line growth has not been very strong but their bottom line growth has been spectacular. They just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs."" That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the top line is challenged. 
I don't mean to take away anything from the team, which did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those 2 things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter."

I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12 earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks, the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers, and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter.
To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology and, most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC and other health authorities around the world, or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers. And I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.
In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology.
Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, we're also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud.
COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility social and machine learning built in.
Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35%, and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%.
As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year; and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter. And the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%, below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items; and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency.
Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion.
During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
Now before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings.
We are confident in our growth because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of 3 distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate, the declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward.
Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for one, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and, importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion.
Third, we have 4 decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud at Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows.
Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These 2 are getting to be a large number.
Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart.
In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies, favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year.
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 Cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's Generation 1 Cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and, thus, eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal.
The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change. And it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.995% availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. 
Furthermore, soon, all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular -- all of the popular things will be truly serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity. And even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud.
Okay. The Oracle Public Cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud at Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering.
To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom and that's the other -- and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about.
Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom services has increased almost 20x since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew.
Okay. Another win in addition to Zoom, 8x8, a great example of our sales process. The customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS -- moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal for 8x8 and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users.
Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a 3-year contract. They built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud at Customer data center in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI Public Cloud services, to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements.
Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest -- the world's ninth largest investment firm, plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications.
Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud at Customer. In the customer's own words, ""The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud at Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50% while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud at Customer, our team could save time and effort and focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.""
Quest Diagnostics. Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing, and they continue to invest in the Oracle Cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud at Customer environment so that the company could migrate its MyQuest portal in anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business business functions.
Another win, Santander Bank. Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud at Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation.
Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's Public Cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and autonomous data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment.
Verizon Business Group, a 4-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission- and business-critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPS, I/Os per second, with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata cloud services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle public cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle.
Another win, Cybereason, a 4-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with end point protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's BareMetal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics.
Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high-performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year.
Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a 3-year contract, moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000-user E-Business Suite application with the goal of lowering costs while improving security, reliability and performance. This win has opened doors to the next phase of SGS' transition to the public cloud, focused on pairing Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud.
Another win, Synacor, 3-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shut down a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure.
Sky.One, a 3-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISV that, again, has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle Cloud.
Another one, another win for Infrastructure, Manappuram Finance in India, a 5-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center with our newly launched hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site.
And I'll stop with -- and then the last infrastructure win I'll talk about is Altair, a 3-year contract, 5x the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI.
There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins.
Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP, never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion, at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago.
Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates -- as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions, we've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player.
Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic.
First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over 2 million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system.
Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM, and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me. Go look at the reports. They're online.
Okay. So where we really distinguished ourselves, in addition to capabilities and also other things, was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report. Look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top, and Workday is right in the middle with 3.0, far behind us.
Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR and payroll system.
All right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting.
Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP, in EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP.
A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations.
Another is a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management.
A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide-ranging program to modernize their corporate systems and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating costs.
Another win in the quarter, an ERP win in the quarter, was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia.
Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins and move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger. North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from the smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chatbots integrated into HCM and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle voice digital assistant. You can do a lot of things, expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone. What makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle voice digital assistant.
Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM.
A very large U.S. managed health care company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.
Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas and MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra."

It's not -- I mean it's great we have Verizon. We have end-user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where they're -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud.
Not everyone believes that -- most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest-cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle. And we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure, to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, ""Hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger so they must be better."" Once they look, we win.
And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in, and we've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS. And we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base, moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth."

So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud, and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in the public cloud. And we had this huge installed base -- we have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle Database. But that's sitting on-premise. And the large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, the only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud at Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing.
So now, after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud at Customer Exadata -- Exadata Cloud at Customer service offering. And so now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise, can now use Cloud at Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying Public Cloud except we put the Database Cloud, the Cloud at Customer, in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- it's attached to our Public Cloud and we manage it for you.
Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in, and it just works. So we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of coexistence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer."

So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that are -- that use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud. And so we've been incredibly successful with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base, has only recently started to upgrade, and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financial, now they're really starting -- as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that.
And one of the things, by the way, that was very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers, and they wanted to -- they like having a suite. They wanted a full suite, of course, our financials and HCM. But in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product, and now we have many references in supply chain, of course, including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers start with us, many of our customers grow over time. So they'll start with some module. And year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some roll in additional capabilities.
And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is, for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionality can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So we have a lot of momentum right now in this business."

And we really just tried to carefully watch our spending while continuing to invest in our future. We are very, very optimistic about the strength of these products. I cannot say that enough. And as a result, we're also very optimistic about the capability of our field to kind of fan out and share this with our prospects. And so we want to make sure we have a very strong technical team in place and a very strong field. So we just did what are the reasonable smart things to do. Everyone, the entire senior management team -- Larry and I don't take the credit, it is really the credit of the entire management team that just got a lot more careful about extraneous spending, and we were able to bring this in."

I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. We were -- I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses, and this is another example where we executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger, while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean we don't care that the SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. There are a bunch of businesses -- we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower-margin businesses. And we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our Infrastructure, OCI Gen2 Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products.
So as some of our lower-margin businesses get smaller and our higher-margin businesses get bigger, it's really -- what's going on is a mix shift, a fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though over the -- if you look at Oracle, and by and large, over the last several years, someone will say, ""Golly, their top line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs."" That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the top line is challenged.
I don't mean to take away anything from the team who did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those 2 things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses, plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter."

I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12 earnings call when we were all still conducting business",1960,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12 earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks, the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers, and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter.
To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology and, most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC and other health authorities around the world, or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers. And I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.
In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology.
Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, we're also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud.
COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility social and machine learning built in.
Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35%, and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%.
As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year; and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter. And the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%, below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items; and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency.
Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion.
During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
Now before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings.
We are confident in our growth because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of 3 distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate, the declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward.
Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for one, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and, importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion.
Third, we have 4 decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud at Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows.
Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These 2 are getting to be a large number.
Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart.
In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies, favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year.
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins, but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning.Oracle Cloud Infrastru",2510,"Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins, but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 Cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's Generation 1 Cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and, thus, eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal.
The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change. And it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.995% availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. 
Furthermore, soon, all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular -- all of the popular things will be truly serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity. And even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud.
Okay. The Oracle Public Cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud at Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering.
To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom and that's the other -- and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about.
Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom services has increased almost 20x since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew.
Okay. Another win in addition to Zoom, 8x8, a great example of our sales process. The customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS -- moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal for 8x8 and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users.
Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a 3-year contract. They built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud at Customer data center in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI Public Cloud services, to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements.
Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest -- the world's ninth largest investment firm, plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications.
Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud at Customer. In the customer's own words, ""The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud at Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50% while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud at Customer, our team could save time and effort and focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.""
Quest Diagnostics. Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing, and they continue to invest in the Oracle Cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud at Customer environment so that the company could migrate its MyQuest portal in anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business business functions.
Another win, Santander Bank. Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud at Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation.
Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's Public Cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and autonomous data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment.
Verizon Business Group, a 4-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission- and business-critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPS, I/Os per second, with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata cloud services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle public cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle.
Another win, Cybereason, a 4-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with end point protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's BareMetal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics.
Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high-performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year.
Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a 3-year contract, moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000-user E-Business Suite application with the goal of lowering costs while improving security, reliability and performance. This win has opened doors to the next phase of SGS' transition to the public cloud, focused on pairing Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud.
Another win, Synacor, 3-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shut down a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure.
Sky.One, a 3-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISV that, again, has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle Cloud.
Another one, another win for Infrastructure, Manappuram Finance in India, a 5-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center with our newly launched hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site.
And I'll stop with -- and then the last infrastructure win I'll talk about is Altair, a 3-year contract, 5x the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI.
There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins.
Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP, never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion, at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago.
Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates -- as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions, we've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player.
Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic.
First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over 2 million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system.
Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM, and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me. Go look at the reports. They're online.
Okay. So where we really distinguished ourselves, in addition to capabilities and also other things, was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report. Look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top, and Workday is right in the middle with 3.0, far behind us.
Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR and payroll system.
All right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting.
Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP, in EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP.
A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations.
Another is a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management.
A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide-ranging program to modernize their corporate systems and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating costs.
Another win in the quarter, an ERP win in the quarter, was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia.
Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins and move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger. North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from the smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chatbots integrated into HCM and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle voice digital assistant.

Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM.
A very large U.S. managed health care company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.
Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas and MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra."

It's not -- I mean it's great we have Verizon. We have end-user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where they're -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud.
Not everyone believes that -- most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest-cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle. And we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure, to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, ""Hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger so they must be better."" Once they look, we win.
And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in, and we've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS. And we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base, moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth."

So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud, and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in the public cloud. And we had this huge installed base -- we have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle Database. But that's sitting on-premise. And the large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, the only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud at Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing.
So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud at Customer Exadata -- Exadata Cloud at Customer service offering. And so now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise, can now use Cloud at Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying Public Cloud except we put the Database Cloud, the Cloud at Customer, in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- it's attached to our Public Cloud and we manage it for you.
Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in, and it just works. So we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of coexistence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer."

So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that are -- that use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud. And so we've been incredibly successful with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base, has only recently started to upgrade, and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financial, now they're really starting -- as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that.
And one of the things, by the way, that was very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers, and they wanted to -- they like having a suite. They wanted a full suite, of course, our financials and HCM. But in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product, and now we have many references in supply chain, of course, including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers start with us, many of our customers grow over time. So they'll start with some module. And year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some roll in additional capabilities.
And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is, for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionality can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So we have a lot of momentum right now in this business."

I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. We were -- I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses, and this is another example where we executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger, while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean we don't care that the SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. There are a bunch of businesses -- we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower-margin businesses. And we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our Infrastructure, OCI Gen2 Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products.
So as some of our lower-margin businesses get smaller and our higher-margin businesses get bigger, it's really -- what's going on is a mix shift, a fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though over the -- if you look at Oracle, and by and large, over the last several years, someone will say, ""Golly, their top line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs."" That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the top line is challenged.
I don't mean to take away anything from the team who did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those 2 things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses, plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter."

I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic.

I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12 earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks, the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers, and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter.
To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology and, most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC and other health authorities around the world, or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers. And I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.
In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology.
Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, we're also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud.
COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility social and machine learning built in.
Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative.
Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3%, with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35%, and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%.
As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year; and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter. And the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%, below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items; and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency.
Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion.
During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.
Now before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings.
We are confident in our growth because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of 3 distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate, the declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward.
Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for one, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and, importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion.
Third, we have 4 decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud at Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows.
Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These 2 are getting to be a large number.
Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart.
In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies, favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year.
Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."
22247,671196867,2028073,"Oracle Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 16, 2020",2020-06-16,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins, but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning.Oracle Cloud Infrastru",2510,"Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins, but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 Cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's Generation 1 Cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and, thus, eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal.
The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change. And it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.995% availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. 
Furthermore, soon, all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular -- all of the popular things will be truly serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity. And even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud.
Okay. The Oracle Public Cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud at Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering.
To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom and that's the other -- and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about.
Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom services has increased almost 20x since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew.
Okay. Another win in addition to Zoom, 8x8, a great example of our sales process. The customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS -- moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal for 8x8 and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users.
Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a 3-year contract. They built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud at Customer data center in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI Public Cloud services, to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements.
Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest -- the world's ninth largest investment firm, plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications.
Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud at Customer. In the customer's own words, ""The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud at Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50% while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud at Customer, our team could save time and effort and focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.""
Quest Diagnostics. Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing, and they continue to invest in the Oracle Cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud at Customer environment so that the company could migrate its MyQuest portal in anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud at Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business business functions.
Another win, Santander Bank. Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud at Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation.
Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's Public Cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and autonomous data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment.
Verizon Business Group, a 4-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission- and business-critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPS, I/Os per second, with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata cloud services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle public cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle.
Another win, Cybereason, a 4-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with end point protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's BareMetal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics.
Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high-performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year.
Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a 3-year contract, moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000-user E-Business Suite application with the goal of lowering costs while improving security, reliability and performance. This win has opened doors to the next phase of SGS' transition to the public cloud, focused on pairing Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud.
Another win, Synacor, 3-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shut down a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure.
Sky.One, a 3-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISV that, again, has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle Cloud.
Another one, another win for Infrastructure, Manappuram Finance in India, a 5-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center with our newly launched hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site.
And I'll stop with -- and then the last infrastructure win I'll talk about is Altair, a 3-year contract, 5x the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI.
There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins.
Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP, never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion, at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago.
Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates -- as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions, we've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player.
Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic.
First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over 2 million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system.
Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM, and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me. Go look at the reports. They're online.
Okay. So where we really distinguished ourselves, in addition to capabilities and also other things, was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report. Look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top, and Workday is right in the middle with 3.0, far behind us.
Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR and payroll system.
All right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting.
Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP, in EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP.
A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations.
Another is a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management.
A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide-ranging program to modernize their corporate systems and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating costs.
Another win in the quarter, an ERP win in the quarter, was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia.
Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins and move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger. North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from the smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chatbots integrated into HCM and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle voice digital assistant. You can do a lot of things, expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone. What makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle voice digital assistant.
Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM.
A very large U.S. managed health care company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.
Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas and MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra."

It's not -- I mean it's great we have Verizon.",453,"Well, I think what we're seeing is now that some people are actually trying -- the people -- the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business of providing their application. It's not -- I mean it's great we have Verizon. We have end-user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where they're -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud.
Not everyone believes that -- most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest-cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle. And we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure, to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, ""Hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger so they must be better."" Once they look, we win.
And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in, and we've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS. And we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base, moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth."

So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud, and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in the public cloud. And we had this huge installed base -- we have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle Database. But that's sitting on-premise. And the large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, the only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud at Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing.
So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud at Customer Exadata -- Exadata Cloud at Customer service offering. And so now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise, can now use Cloud at Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying Public Cloud except we put the Database Cloud, the Cloud at Customer, in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- it's attached to our Public Cloud and we manage it for you.
Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud at Customer, Gen2 Cloud at Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in, and it just works. So we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of coexistence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud at Customer."

So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that are -- that use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud. And so we've been incredibly successful with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base, has only recently started to upgrade, and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financial, now they're really starting -- as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that.
And one of the things, by the way, that was very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers, and they wanted to -- they like having a suite. They wanted a full suite, of course, our financials and HCM. But in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product, and now we have many references in supply chain, of course, including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers start with us, many of our customers grow over time. So they'll start with some module. And year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some roll in additional capabilities.
And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is, for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionality can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So we have a lot of momentum right now in this business."

And we really just tried to carefully watch our spending while continuing to invest in our future. We are very, very optimistic about the strength of these products. I cannot say that enough. And as a result, we're also very optimistic about the capability of our field to kind of fan out and share this with our prospects.

I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. We were -- I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses, and this is another example where we executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger, while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean we don't care that the SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. There are a bunch of businesses -- we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower-margin businesses. And we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our Infrastructure, OCI Gen2 Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products.
So as some of our lower-margin businesses get smaller and our higher-margin businesses get bigger, it's really -- what's going on is a mix shift, a fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though over the -- if you look at Oracle, and by and large, over the last several years, someone will say, ""Golly, their top line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs."" That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the top line is challenged.
I don't mean to take away anything from the team who did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those 2 things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses, plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter."

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask. 
So now to Oracle's results, as you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, revenue was more than $150 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS was [ $0.07 ] above the midpoint. Currency helped a little but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in 3 years. 
As I've said previously and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our Fusion SaaS momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of Autonomous Database, which will continue to get even better now that we have Autonomous Database available on Cloud at Customer. Our total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 2% from last year and accounted for 74% of total company revenue. 
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.8 billion, up 4%, but our Fusion apps were up 26% with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. On our Fusion retention rate, which are already high, continue to go up. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 1% but with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous Database consumption revenue was up 64%, and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up [ 130% ]. License revenues were $886 million, up 8%, so all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, up 2%. 
As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, and as I said, up 8% from last year and our best operating income growth in 3 years. Obviously, we're thrilled with these results, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 15% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16% and up 15% in constant currency. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion with capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. 
Gross deferred revenue was, in fact, up in constant currency and it was up 2%. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. 
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency though is extremely volatile, as you can see in what happened in this quarter. And -- but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive income effect on EPS for Q2. 
So with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars. And because we will have slightly under a 1% tailwind, so in constant currency, that kind of rounds into 0 to 2% but probably at the higher side. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again, that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind, so non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 and $1.02 in U.S. dollars. 
Now my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it, sometimes, it's a little above it. However, onetime cash events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect in normalizing for these things, it will average to 20% so that's what I targeted in this guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."
22247,686880924,2094796,"Oracle Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 10, 2020",2020-09-10,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Safra. Let's see.

Let's see. Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS, and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only 1 that spans these 2 markets. It's a very interesting dynamic. 
I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the cloud. While analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications #1 in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in HCM, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on. But what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service business. 
I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. ""In the 2020 Industry Cloud Path survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers, on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google, Oracle IaaS, OCI, received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveys said they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future."" 
I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you and many of our competitors, just as Zoom picking Oracle infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past. I know the biggest question for investors has been, can Oracle preserve its huge market-leading database franchise into this new cloud era? Well, interesting question. Obviously, an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle. But if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI, is, in fact, as IDC describes it, the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction and that same IaaS, OCI is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database, where do you think the Oracle database -- installed base is going to go? 
What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle public cloud, the only place you could get the Autonomous Database and Oracle Cloud at Customer -- excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reasons, much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are -- and I'll talk about being people like 8x8 are -- another video conferencing system are moving entirely from AWS on to the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle about moving to the Oracle Cloud. 
VIM is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI in Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company name become a verb. At Oracle, we love to Zoom as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple-digit revenue growth in sequential quarters, from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. 
OCI cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions. And we'll be adding at least another 10 regions in the next 9 months. We're not slowing down, we're speeding up. Oracle Database Cloud at Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle database in the public cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to database Cloud at Customer, which is a unique Oracle offering and they're going directly into our public cloud. The price is the same in both cases, the database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases. 
We are seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud at Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first Autonomous Database. And the Oracle -- the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only Autonomous Database. Then in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today, Oracle Autonomous Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system. 
Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates site downtime. If a data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically -- immediately and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption. And no human labor is required to set up and configure Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do. You just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this autonomous reliability feature. 
Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region, Gen 2 Cloud at Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen 2 public cloud behind their firewall in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle database behind your firewall, it's every service that's in our public cloud, compute, storage, Fusion applications, plus the Autonomous Database, Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything. And we manage it and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall. 
Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous revenue grew -- Autonomous Database revenue grew 64% in annualized consumption. Our Gen 2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market and we're taking market share in the process. With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And so we were -- what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the cloud. And does have implications on license because options grew not only -- database options grew not only double digits but actually 20-something percent. And analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our cloud. 
But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle-specific hardware that's very strategic, still continues to do well. But really, the big barn beaters are the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly and now OCI and our Database Cloud products, services are growing and they're getting larger and larger. And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over 100% and this kind of -- this is now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses, I'll give you an example, On-premise Consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster. 
And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then, of course, you have the cases that Larry talked about where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen 2 is just so good and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the covers, and it's a very easy extrapolation as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow."

And for Safra, are there any leading indicators you can point to, maybe backlog or anything else, to help us understand the leading demand for these products and -- which I assume it supports your confidence in the overall business accelerating?"

So we've been working on Oracle Autonomous Database for several years. As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you -- but if you're an on-premise user, there was",330,"Yes. I think I can explain it very clearly. So we've been working on Oracle Autonomous Database for several years. As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you -- but if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So the Oracle Autonomous Database was available in our public cloud and has been for 3 years, and it keeps getting better and better. But if you're a big on-premise customer, you didn't have the late assets to our latest and greatest database. It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our late technology was not available to the vast majority of our customers. 
All of a sudden, with Cloud at Customer, with Database Cloud at Customer at very low prices, our -- you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database and have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think the growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version 1 -- I'll just -- full disclosure. We had a version 1 of this that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version 2 is kind of the extreme office that we learned a lot. And version 2 is really a plug and play. It goes in very, very fast and it's very simple to use, incredibly reliable. And we're -- and we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth, Oracle Database Cloud at Customer. 
And the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's 2 ways that -- people are going to make the choice to upgrade and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database, and once in Autonomous Database, they're not going anywhere."

Let me start but I know Larry is going to want to say 2 things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our new Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all things",375,"Okay. Let me start but I know Larry is going to want to say 2 things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our new Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all things, they're on the Oracle database, they're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen 2, which is powerful enough, secure enough and scalable enough for their crown jewels. 
And they've literally waited, and I know and I have visibility into sort of the future because often, they want to do what we call BYOL, bring your own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads. Now it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us, the communications industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high-performance applications that run on Oracle, they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. 
Now some of them are putting it into public cloud. Many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others are doing Cloud at Customer. And this second generation of Cloud at Customer now with Autonomous Database is just so powerful for our customers. So we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications. And then there are applications that otherwise just run as some of the competing cloud services that when they do, just like Zoom did, like 8x8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network, a lot of compute, they use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performant, and since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack, and it's really very, very, very broad-based for us. I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about -- add some more to that."

A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle in AWS. They tried. It just didn't work very well. So they've decided maybe they should wait. And so they did. So they did try. They looked around, they experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. 
We have an Exadata cloud service. We have -- Autonomous Database is not available any place but the Oracle Cloud. Exadata database service isn't available any place but the Oracle Cloud. We're much better -- you'd expect it to be much better at running Oracle applications than anybody else and we are and a significant percentage of enterprise applications. I don't know, 40% -- 30%, 40% are Oracle applications. So that's just a gigantic installed base that we think is going to be moving to the Oracle -- we're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. That's 1 fact. So they tried, didn't work. So they're coming to us. 
Next thing. A lot of our application customers. We've got well over 7,000 customer, Fusion application customer, 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data. Everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle infrastructure services. The Oracle Analytics Cloud, Oracle Infrastructure Service and OCI service, the Autonomous Database and OCI service. So our application customers, pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become, in the not-too-distant future, will become infrastructure customers. 
A lot -- again, and you've got to add them on to. So these are people that are SaaS customers that are going to become infrastructure customers. On-premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud at Customer or public cloud. Then there are surprises like Zoom and 8x8. And -- but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performant and economical. They pick it because there's nothing to do with the Oracle database. It has nothing with being a SaaS customer. That was just purely an evaluation of our cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon's. 
And another example of that is high-performance computing. Car companies simulating crashes. Now why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high-performance computing when you can go to Google or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore, we're much, much faster. And therefore, they get the simulations on faster but they've got to be willing to pay less. Almost every car company -- well, that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high-performance computing or evaluating our high-performance computing because we benchmark so well against the competition. 
And this is all new business like the video conferencing business. So the OCI team did a spectacular job of building a second generation, learning from what Microsoft did, what Google did, what Amazon did and then building the next generation. And it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So -- and again -- and these are very early days. Gen 2 OCI is relatively new, and Gen 2 Cloud at Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years."

Probably is true for everybody else but it's not true for us. We have this thing called bring your own license to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses, buy more licenses. And our pitch is you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the cloud and get big discounts running database in the cloud. 
So you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old -- a revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people, we have -- when we see and these big contracts for database, the reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them, not all of them, but a lot -- majority of them is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our public cloud, to Cloud at Customer and getting big discounts, getting a benefit, getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So again, don't translate license to mean not cloud. A lot of the license is, in fact, cloud as well as on"

This is the first quarter we've seen without negative growth in a long time and to see you hitting 70% gross margin, pretty impressive and far sooner than what we would have thought.

So the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata. Revenue in Exadata was up 15%.

And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog, really the largest -- it's actually double what it was -- more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strong. We -- it has now gotten large enough. And the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain and that's taking a while to resolve itself. But we were able to make and ship a lot of Exadatas but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating. 
And of course, what that points to is a commitment by our customers to Oracle. You don't buy an Exadata to run anything but Oracle database application, database systems. And that commitment to the Oracle platform has really shown up in this area. Cloud at Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud at Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the cloud line when they go online and they consume credit, so -- cloud credit. So it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all."

And as that gets smaller, sometimes replaced by Fusion, that's why that business is really doing very, very well because the ERP -- everything Fusion but Fusion ERP, HCM, this whole area really growing quickly. 
I mean, what you see is many of our customers, both e-business suite, JD Edwards customers, but we also see a new phenomena, which is, historically, it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer, too. But now we find that many of those doors are not only can be -- basically are already open for us. So as the only provider of ERP in the cloud for large, medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers simply because they're really very frustrated with their -- with the vendors that they have installed on-premise.

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.
So now to Oracle's results. As you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, revenue was more than $150 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS was $0.07 above the midpoint. Currency helped a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in 3 years.
As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our Fusion SaaS momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of Autonomous Database, which will continue to get even better now that we have Autonomous Database available on Cloud at Customer.
Our total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 2% from last year, and accounted for 74% of total company revenue.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.8 billion, up 4%. Our Fusion apps were up 26%, with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. And our Fusion retention rate, which are already high, continue to go up.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 1%, with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous Database consumption revenue was up 64%, and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. License revenues were $886 million, up 8%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, up 2%.
As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending, with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion and, as I said, up 8% from last year, and our best operating income growth in 3 years. Obviously, we're thrilled with these results, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 15% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16% and up 15% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion with capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was, in fact, up in constant currency, and it was up 2%.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency, though, is extremely volatile as you can see in what happened in this quarter and -- but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive effect on EPS for Q2.
So with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars. And because we will have slightly under a 1% tailwind, so in constant currency, that kind of rounds into 0 to 2% but probably at the higher side.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again, that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind, so non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 and $1.02 in U.S. dollars.
Now my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it; sometimes, it's a little above it. However, onetime cash events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect, in normalizing for these things, it will average to 20% so that's what I targeted in this guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Let's see, Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are",1060,"Thanks, Safra. Let's see, Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these 2 markets. It's a very interesting dynamic.
I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the cloud. While analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications #1 in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time: we're #1 in customer satisfaction in HCM, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service business.
I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020 Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers, on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google, Oracle IaaS, OCI, received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveys said they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you and many of our competitors, just as Zoom picking Oracle infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past.
I know the biggest question for investors has been can Oracle preserve its huge market-leading database franchise into this new cloud era. Well, interesting question; obviously, an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle. But if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI, is, in fact, as IDC describes it: the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction, and that same IaaS, OCI, is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database, where do you think the Oracle database -- installed base is going to go?
What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle Public Cloud, the only place you could get the Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud at Customer -- excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reasons: much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are -- and I'll talk about being -- people like 8x8, another video conferencing system, are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle about moving to the Oracle Cloud.
Vim is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI in Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company name become a verb. At Oracle, we love to Zoom as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple-digit revenue growth in sequential quarters, from Q4 last year to Q1 this year.
OCI cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions. And we'll be adding at least another 10 regions in the next 9 months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle Database Cloud at Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database and the Public Cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud at Customer, which is a unique Oracle offering, and they're going directly into our Public Cloud. The price is the same in both cases, the Database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases.
We are seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud at Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database. And the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. Then in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today, Oracle Autonomous Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system.
Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates site downtime. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically -- immediately and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do. You just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this autonomous reliability feature.
Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen2 public cloud behind their firewall in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall, it's every service that's in our public cloud: compute, storage, Fusion applications, plus the Autonomous Database, Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything. And we manage it and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall.
Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous revenue grew -- Autonomous Database revenue grew 64% in annualized consumption. Our Gen2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market, and we're taking market share in the process.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And so we were -- what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the cloud. And that does have implications on license because options grew not only -- Database options grew not only double digits but actually 20-something percent. And Analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our cloud.
But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle-specific hardware that's very strategic still continues to do well. But really, the big barn beaters are the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now, OCI and our Database Cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger. And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over 100%, and this kind of -- this now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses -- I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster.
And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then, of course, you have the cases that Larry talked about where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen2 is just so good and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the covers, and it's a very easy extrapolation as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow."

As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So the Oracle Autonomous Database was available in our public cloud and has been for 3 years, and it keeps getting better and better. But if you're a big on-premise customer, you didn't have the late -- assets to our latest and greatest database. It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our latest technology was not available to the vast majority of our customers.
All of a sudden, with Cloud at Customer, with Database Cloud at Customer, at very low prices, you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database and have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think the growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version 1. I'll just -- full disclosure, we had a version 1 of this that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version 2 is kind of the extreme opus that we learned a lot. And version 2 is really a plug-and-play. It goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use, incredibly reliable. And we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth, Oracle Database Cloud at Customer.
And the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's 2 ways that -- people are going to make the choice to upgrade and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once in Autonomous Database, they're not going anywhere."

Let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say a few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all custom things that are on the Oracle Database, they're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen2, which is powerful enough, secure enough and scalable enough for their crown jewels. And they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future, because often they want to do what we call BYOL, bring your own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads.
Now it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communications industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high-performance applications that run on Oracle, they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it into public cloud. Many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others, are doing Cloud at Customer. And this second generation of Cloud at Customer, now with Autonomous Database, is just so powerful for our customers. So we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications.
And then there are applications that otherwise just run at some of the competing cloud services that when they do, just like Zoom did, like 8x8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network, a lot of compute, may use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performant. And since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack, and it's really very, very, very broad-based for us.
I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about -- add some more to that."

A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle with AWS. They tried. It just didn't work very well. So they've decided maybe they should wait. And so they did. So they did try. They looked around, they experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata cloud service. We have -- Autonomous Database is not available any place but the Oracle Cloud. Exadata database service isn't available any place but the Oracle Cloud. We're much better at -- you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle applications than anybody else, and we are. And a significant percentage of enterprise applications, I don't know, 40% -- 30%, 40% are Oracle applications. So that's just a gigantic installed base that we think is going to be moving to the Oracle -- we're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. That's one fact. So they tried, didn't work. So they're coming to us.
Next thing. A lot of our application customers, we've got well over 7,000 customer -- Fusion application customer -- 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data. Everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle infrastructure services. The Oracle Analytics Cloud is in Oracle infrastructure services, in OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So our application customers, pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become, in the not-too-distant future, infrastructure customers. A lot -- again, and you've got to add them onto it. So these are people that are SaaS customers that are going to become infrastructure customers.
On-premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud at Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are the surprises like Zoom and 8x8. And -- but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performant and economical. They picked it because there's nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them being a SaaS customer. That was just purely an evaluation of our cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon's.
And another example of that is high-performance computing, car companies simulating crashes. Now why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high-performance computing when you can go to Google or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore -- we're much, much faster. And therefore, they get the simulations done faster, but they've got to be willing to pay less. Almost every car  -- well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high-performance computing or evaluating our high-performance computing because we benchmark so well against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business.
So the OCI team did a spectacular job of building a second generation, learning from what Microsoft did, what Google did, what Amazon did and then building the next generation. And it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So -- and again -- and these are very early days. Gen2 OCI is relatively new, and Gen2 Cloud at Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years."

We encourage our customers to buy licenses -- buy more licenses. And our pitch is you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the cloud and get big discounts running database in the cloud.
So you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old -- a revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people, we have -- when we see -- ULAs and these big contracts for database, the reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them -- not all of them but a majority of them -- is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our Public Cloud, to Cloud at Customer and getting big discounts, getting a benefit, getting better prices by doing that.

But we also see a new phenomena, which is, historically, it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer, too. But now we find that many of those doors are not only can be -- basically are already open for us. So as the only provider of ERP in the cloud for large -- medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers simply because they're really very frustrated with their -- with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So this business for us is an enormous opportunity, and it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact."

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.So now to Oracle's results. As you can see, we had a gre",890,"Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.
So now to Oracle's results. As you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, revenue was more than $150 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS was $0.07 above the midpoint. Currency helped a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in 3 years.
As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our Fusion SaaS momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of Autonomous Database, which will continue to get even better now that we have Autonomous Database available on Cloud at Customer.
Our total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 2% from last year, and accounted for 74% of total company revenue.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.8 billion, up 4%. Our Fusion apps were up 26%, with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. And our Fusion retention rate, which are already high, continue to go up.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 1%, with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous Database consumption revenue was up 64%, and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. License revenues were $886 million, up 8%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, up 2%.
As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending, with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion and, as I said, up 8% from last year, and our best operating income growth in 3 years. Obviously, we're thrilled with these results, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 15% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16% and up 15% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion with capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was, in fact, up in constant currency, and it was up 2%.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency, though, is extremely volatile as you can see in what happened in this quarter and -- but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive effect on EPS for Q2.
So with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars. And because we will have slightly under a 1% tailwind, so in constant currency, that kind of rounds into 0 to 2% but probably at the higher side.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again, that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind, so non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 and $1.02 in U.S. dollars.
Now my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it; sometimes, it's a little above it. However, onetime cash events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect, in normalizing for these things, it will average to 20% so that's what I targeted in this guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are",1060,"Thanks, Safra. Let's see, Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these 2 markets. It's a very interesting dynamic.
I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the cloud. While analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications #1 in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time: we're #1 in customer satisfaction in HCM, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service business.
I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020 Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers, on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google, Oracle IaaS, OCI, received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveys said they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you and many of our competitors, just as Zoom picking Oracle infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past.
I know the biggest question for investors has been can Oracle preserve its huge market-leading database franchise into this new cloud era. Well, interesting question; obviously, an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle. But if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI, is, in fact, as IDC describes it: the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction, and that same IaaS, OCI, is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database, where do you think the Oracle database -- installed base is going to go?
What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle Public Cloud, the only place you could get the Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud at Customer -- excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reasons: much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are -- and I'll talk about being -- people like 8x8, another video conferencing system, are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle about moving to the Oracle Cloud.
Vim is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI in Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company name become a verb. At Oracle, we love to Zoom as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple-digit revenue growth in sequential quarters, from Q4 last year to Q1 this year.
OCI cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions. And we'll be adding at least another 10 regions in the next 9 months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle Database Cloud at Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database and the Public Cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud at Customer, which is a unique Oracle offering, and they're going directly into our Public Cloud. The price is the same in both cases, the Database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases.
We are seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud at Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database. And the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. Then in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today, Oracle Autonomous Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system.
Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates site downtime. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically -- immediately and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do. You just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this autonomous reliability feature.
Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen2 public cloud behind their firewall in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall, it's every service that's in our public cloud: compute, storage, Fusion applications, plus the Autonomous Database, Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything. And we manage it and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall.
Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous revenue grew -- Autonomous Database revenue grew 64% in annualized consumption. Our Gen2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market, and we're taking market share in the process.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And so we were -- what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the cloud. And that does have implications on license because options grew not only -- Database options grew not only double digits but actually 20-something percent. And Analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our cloud.
But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle-specific hardware that's very strategic still continues to do well. But really, the big barn beaters are the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now, OCI and our Database Cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger. And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over 100%, and this kind of -- this now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses -- I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster.
And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then, of course, you have the cases that Larry talked about where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen2 is just so good and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the covers, and it's a very easy extrapolation as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow."

As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So the Oracle Autonomous Database was available in our public cloud and has been for 3 years, and it keeps getting better and better. But if you're a big on-premise customer, you didn't have the late -- assets to our latest and greatest database. It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our latest technology was not available to the vast majority of our customers.
All of a sudden, with Cloud at Customer, with Database Cloud at Customer, at very low prices, you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database and have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think the growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version 1. I'll just -- full disclosure, we had a version 1 of this that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version 2 is kind of the extreme opus that we learned a lot. And version 2 is really a plug-and-play. It goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use, incredibly reliable. And we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth, Oracle Database Cloud at Customer.
And the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's 2 ways that -- people are going to make the choice to upgrade and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once in Autonomous Database, they're not going anywhere."

Let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say a few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all custom things that are on the Oracle Database, they're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen2, which is powerful enough, secure enough and scalable enough for their crown jewels. And they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future, because often they want to do what we call BYOL, bring your own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads.
Now it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communications industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high-performance applications that run on Oracle, they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it into public cloud. Many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others, are doing Cloud at Customer. And this second generation of Cloud at Customer, now with Autonomous Database, is just so powerful for our customers. So we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications.
And then there are applications that otherwise just run at some of the competing cloud services that when they do, just like Zoom did, like 8x8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network, a lot of compute, may use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performant. And since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack, and it's really very, very, very broad-based for us.
I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about -- add some more to that."

A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle with AWS. They tried. It just didn't work very well. So they've decided maybe they should wait. And so they did. So they did try. They looked around, they experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata cloud service. We have -- Autonomous Database is not available any place but the Oracle Cloud. Exadata database service isn't available any place but the Oracle Cloud. We're much better at -- you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle applications than anybody else, and we are. And a significant percentage of enterprise applications, I don't know, 40% -- 30%, 40% are Oracle applications. So that's just a gigantic installed base that we think is going to be moving to the Oracle -- we're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. That's one fact. So they tried, didn't work. So they're coming to us.
Next thing. A lot of our application customers, we've got well over 7,000 customer -- Fusion application customer -- 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data. Everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle infrastructure services. The Oracle Analytics Cloud is in Oracle infrastructure services, in OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So our application customers, pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become, in the not-too-distant future, infrastructure customers. A lot -- again, and you've got to add them onto it. So these are people that are SaaS customers that are going to become infrastructure customers.
On-premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud at Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are the surprises like Zoom and 8x8. And -- but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performant and economical. They picked it because there's nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them being a SaaS customer. That was just purely an evaluation of our cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon's.
And another example of that is high-performance computing, car companies simulating crashes. Now why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high-performance computing when you can go to Google or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore -- we're much, much faster. And therefore, they get the simulations done faster, but they've got to be willing to pay less. Almost every car  -- well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high-performance computing or evaluating our high-performance computing because we benchmark so well against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business.
So the OCI team did a spectacular job of building a second generation, learning from what Microsoft did, what Google did, what Amazon did and then building the next generation. And it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So -- and again -- and these are very early days. Gen2 OCI is relatively new, and Gen2 Cloud at Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years."

People think our -- they see license business and they translate in their brain, license means on-premise. That is not true for us. It may be true for everybody else, by the way; probably is true for everybody else, but it's not true for us. We have this thing called Bring Your Own License to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses -- buy more licenses. And our pitch is you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the cloud and get big discounts running database in the cloud.
So you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old -- a revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people, we have -- when we see -- ULAs and these big contracts for database, the reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them -- not all of them but a majority of them -- is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our Public Cloud, to Cloud at Customer and getting big discounts, getting a benefit, getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So again, don't translate license to mean not cloud. A lot of the license is, in fact, cloud as well as on-premise."

It's not -- it's generally not going to be staying on-premise. Some, of course, stays on-premise and some will stay on-premise indefinitely, but many companies will be either hybrid or will be Cloud at Customer or, of course, in the public cloud.

So the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata. Revenue in Exadata was up 15%; bookings in our strategic hardware, also up very, very high double digits. And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog, really the largest -- it's actually double what it was -- more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strong. We -- it has now gotten large enough. And the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain. And that's taking a while to resolve itself, but we were able to make and ship a lot of Exadatas but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating.
And of course, what that points to is a commitment by our customers to Oracle. You don't buy an Exadata to run anything but Oracle database application -- database systems. And that commitment to the Oracle platform has really shown up in this area. Cloud at Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud at Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the cloud line when they go online and they consume credit, so -- cloud credit. So it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all."

And that is the less strategic part of our business. And as that gets smaller, it's sometimes replaced by Fusion. That's why that business is really doing very, very well because the ERP -- everything Fusion, Fusion ERP, HCM, this whole area really growing quickly.
I mean what you see is many of our customers, both E-Business Suite, SQL stuff, JD Edwards customers. But we also see a new phenomena, which is, historically, it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer, too. But now we find that many of those doors are not only can be -- basically are already open for us. So as the only provider of ERP in the cloud for large -- medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers simply because they're really very frustrated with their -- with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So this business for us is an enormous opportunity, and it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact."

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.
So now to Oracle's results. As you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, revenue was more than $150 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS was $0.07 above the midpoint. Currency helped a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in 3 years.
As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our Fusion SaaS momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of Autonomous Database, which will continue to get even better now that we have Autonomous Database available on Cloud at Customer.
Our total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 2% from last year, and accounted for 74% of total company revenue.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.8 billion, up 4%. Our Fusion apps were up 26%, with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. And our Fusion retention rate, which are already high, continue to go up.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 1%, with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous Database consumption revenue was up 64%, and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. License revenues were $886 million, up 8%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, up 2%.
As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending, with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion and, as I said, up 8% from last year, and our best operating income growth in 3 years. Obviously, we're thrilled with these results, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 15% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16% and up 15% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion with capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was, in fact, up in constant currency, and it was up 2%.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency, though, is extremely volatile as you can see in what happened in this quarter and -- but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive effect on EPS for Q2.
So with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars. And because we will have slightly under a 1% tailwind, so in constant currency, that kind of rounds into 0 to 2% but probably at the higher side.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again, that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind, so non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 and $1.02 in U.S. dollars.
Now my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it; sometimes, it's a little above it. However, onetime cash events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect, in normalizing for these things, it will average to 20% so that's what I targeted in this guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."
22247,686880924,2109993,"Oracle Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 10, 2020",2020-09-10,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Safra. Let's see, Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are",1060,"Thanks, Safra. Let's see, Oracle occupies a unique position in the cloud market. Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these 2 markets. It's a very interesting dynamic.
I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the cloud. While analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications #1 in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time: we're #1 in customer satisfaction in HCM, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service business.
I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020 Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers, on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google, Oracle IaaS, OCI, received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveys said they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you and many of our competitors, just as Zoom picking Oracle infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past.
I know the biggest question for investors has been can Oracle preserve its huge market-leading database franchise into this new cloud era. Well, interesting question; obviously, an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle. But if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI, is, in fact, as IDC describes it: the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction, and that same IaaS, OCI, is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database, where do you think the Oracle database -- installed base is going to go?
What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle Public Cloud, the only place you could get the Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud at Customer -- excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reasons: much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are -- and I'll talk about being -- people like 8x8, another video conferencing system, are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle about moving to the Oracle Cloud.
Vim is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI in Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company name become a verb. At Oracle, we love to Zoom as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple-digit revenue growth in sequential quarters, from Q4 last year to Q1 this year.
OCI cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions. And we'll be adding at least another 10 regions in the next 9 months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle Database Cloud at Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database and the Public Cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud at Customer, which is a unique Oracle offering, and they're going directly into our Public Cloud. The price is the same in both cases, the Database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases.
We are seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud at Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database. And the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. Then in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today, Oracle Autonomous Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system.
Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates site downtime. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically -- immediately and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do. You just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this autonomous reliability feature.
Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen2 public cloud behind their firewall in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall, it's every service that's in our public cloud: compute, storage, Fusion applications, plus the Autonomous Database, Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything. And we manage it and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall.
Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous revenue grew -- Autonomous Database revenue grew 64% in annualized consumption. Our Gen2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market, and we're taking market share in the process.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And so we were -- what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the cloud. And that does have implications on license because options grew not only -- Database options grew not only double digits but actually 20-something percent. And Analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our cloud.
But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle-specific hardware that's very strategic still continues to do well. But really, the big barn beaters are the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now, OCI and our Database Cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger. And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over 100%, and this kind of -- this now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses -- I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster.
And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then, of course, you have the cases that Larry talked about where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen2 is just so good and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the covers, and it's a very easy extrapolation as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow."

Clearly, there's a lot of excitement for how it can enable very large customers to adopt Autonomous Database and have all the benefits of OCI behind the firewall. And I appreciate it's only really become available in the last few months. But maybe for Larry, from a product market fit perspective, could you explain why this is such a big deal? And for Safra, are there any leading indicators you can point to, maybe backlog or anything else, to help us understand the leading demand for these products and which I assume it supports your confidence in the overall business accelerating?"

As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So the Oracle Autonomous Database was available in our public cloud and has been for 3 years, and it keeps getting better and better. But if you're a big on-premise customer, you didn't have the late -- assets to our latest and greatest database. It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our latest technology was not available to the vast majority of our customers.
All of a sudden, with Cloud at Customer, with Database Cloud at Customer, at very low prices, you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database and have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think the growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version 1. I'll just -- full disclosure, we had a version 1 of this that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version 2 is kind of the extreme opus that we learned a lot. And version 2 is really a plug-and-play. It goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use, incredibly reliable. And we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth, Oracle Database Cloud at Customer.
And the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's 2 ways that -- people are going to make the choice to upgrade and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once in Autonomous Database, they're not going anywhere."

Let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say a few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all custom things that are on the Oracle Database, they're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen2, which is powerful enough, secure enough and scalable enough for their crown jewels. And they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future, because often they want to do what we call BYOL, bring your own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads.
Now it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communications industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high-performance applications that run on Oracle, they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it into public cloud. Many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others, are doing Cloud at Customer. And this second generation of Cloud at Customer, now with Autonomous Database, is just so powerful for our customers. So we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications.
And then there are applications that otherwise just run at some of the competing cloud services that when they do, just like Zoom did, like 8x8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network, a lot of compute, may use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performant. And since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack, and it's really very, very, very broad-based for us.
I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about -- add some more to that."

A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle with AWS. They tried. It just didn't work very well. So they've decided maybe they should wait. And so they did. So they did try. They looked around, they experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata cloud service. We have -- Autonomous Database is not available any place but the Oracle Cloud. Exadata database service isn't available any place but the Oracle Cloud. We're much better at -- you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle applications than anybody else, and we are. And a significant percentage of enterprise applications, I don't know, 40% -- 30%, 40% are Oracle applications. So that's just a gigantic installed base that we think is going to be moving to the Oracle -- we're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. That's one fact. So they tried, didn't work. So they're coming to us.
Next thing. A lot of our application customers, we've got well over 7,000 customer -- Fusion application customer -- 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data. Everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle infrastructure services. The Oracle Analytics Cloud is in Oracle infrastructure services, in OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So our application customers, pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become, in the not-too-distant future, infrastructure customers. A lot -- again, and you've got to add them onto it. So these are people that are SaaS customers that are going to become infrastructure customers.
On-premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud at Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are the surprises like Zoom and 8x8. And -- but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performant and economical. They picked it because there's nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them being a SaaS customer. That was just purely an evaluation of our cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon's.
And another example of that is high-performance computing, car companies simulating crashes. Now why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high-performance computing when you can go to Google or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore -- we're much, much faster. And therefore, they get the simulations done faster, but they've got to be willing to pay less. Almost every car -- well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high-performance computing or evaluating our high-performance computing because we benchmark so well against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business.
So the OCI team did a spectacular job of building a second generation, learning from what Microsoft did, what Google did, what Amazon did and then building the next generation. And it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So -- and again -- and these are very early days. Gen2 OCI is relatively new, and Gen2 Cloud at Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years."

People think our -- they see license business and they translate in their brain, license means on-premise. That is not true for us. It may be true for everybody else, by the way; probably is true for everybody else, but it's not true for us. We have this thing called Bring Your Own License to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses -- buy more licenses. And our pitch is you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the cloud and get big discounts running database in the cloud.
So you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old -- a revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people, we have -- when we see -- ULAs and these big contracts for database, the reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them -- not all of them but a majority of them -- is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our Public Cloud, to Cloud at Customer and getting big discounts, getting a benefit, getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So again, don't translate license to mean not cloud. A lot of the license is, in fact, cloud as well as on-premise."

So the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata.

And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog, really the largest -- it's actually double what it was -- more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strong. We -- it has now gotten large enough. And the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain. And that's taking a while to resolve itself, but we were able to make and ship a lot of Exadatas but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating.
And of course, what that points to is a commitment by our customers to Oracle. You don't buy an Exadata to run anything but Oracle database application -- database systems. And that commitment to the Oracle platform has really shown up in this area. Cloud at Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud at Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the cloud line when they go online and they consume credit, so -- cloud credit. So it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all."

And that is the less strategic part of our business. And as that gets smaller, it's sometimes replaced by Fusion. That's why that business is really doing very, very well because the ERP -- everything Fusion, Fusion ERP, HCM, this whole area really growing quickly.
I mean what you see is many of our customers, both E-Business Suite, SQL stuff, JD Edwards customers. But we also see a new phenomena, which is, historically, it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer, too. But now we find that many of those doors are not only can be -- basically are already open for us. So as the only provider of ERP in the cloud for large -- medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers simply because they're really very frustrated with their -- with the vendors that they have installed on-premise.

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask.
So now to Oracle's results. As you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, revenue was more than $150 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS was $0.07 above the midpoint. Currency helped a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in 3 years.
As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our Fusion SaaS momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of Autonomous Database, which will continue to get even better now that we have Autonomous Database available on Cloud at Customer.
Our total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 2% from last year, and accounted for 74% of total company revenue.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.8 billion, up 4%. Our Fusion apps were up 26%, with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. And our Fusion retention rate, which are already high, continue to go up.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 1%, with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous Database consumption revenue was up 64%, and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. License revenues were $886 million, up 8%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.4 billion, up 2%.
As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending, with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion and, as I said, up 8% from last year, and our best operating income growth in 3 years. Obviously, we're thrilled with these results, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 15% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16% and up 15% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.1 billion with capital expenditures of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was, in fact, up in constant currency, and it was up 2%.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency, though, is extremely volatile as you can see in what happened in this quarter and -- but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive effect on EPS for Q2.
So with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars. And because we will have slightly under a 1% tailwind, so in constant currency, that kind of rounds into 0 to 2% but probably at the higher side.
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again, that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind, so non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 and $1.02 in U.S. dollars.
Now my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it; sometimes, it's a little above it. However, onetime cash events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect, in normalizing for these things, it will average to 20% so that's what I targeted in this guidance.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

Oracle is the only cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market, SaaS; and the infrastructure-as-a-service market, IaaS. Our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these 2 markets. It's a very interesting dynamic.
I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the cloud. While analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications #1 in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time: we're #1 in customer satisfaction in HCM, we're #1 in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service business.
I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020 Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers, on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors, including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM and Google, Oracle IaaS, OCI, received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveys said they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you and many of our competitors, just as Zoom picking Oracle infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past.
I know the biggest question for investors has been can Oracle preserve its huge market-leading database franchise into this new cloud era. Well, interesting question; obviously, an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle. But if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI, is, in fact, as IDC describes it: the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction, and that same IaaS, OCI, is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database, where do you think the Oracle database -- installed base is going to go?
What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle Public Cloud, the only place you could get the Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud at Customer -- excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reasons: much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are -- and I'll talk about being -- people like 8x8, another video conferencing system, are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle about moving to the Oracle Cloud.
Vim is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI in Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company name become a verb. At Oracle, we love to Zoom as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple-digit revenue growth in sequential quarters, from Q4 last year to Q1 this year.
OCI cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions. And we'll be adding at least another 10 regions in the next 9 months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle Database Cloud at Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database and the Public Cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud at Customer, which is a unique Oracle offering, and they're going directly into our Public Cloud. The price is the same in both cases, the Database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases.
We are seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud at Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database. And the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. Then in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today, Oracle Autonomous Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system.
Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates site downtime. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically -- immediately and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do. You just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this autonomous reliability feature.
Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region, Gen2 Cloud at Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen2 public cloud behind their firewall in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall, it's every service that's in our public cloud: compute, storage, Fusion applications, plus the Autonomous Database, Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything. And we manage it and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall.
Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous revenue grew -- Autonomous Database revenue grew 64% in annualized consumption. Our Gen2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market, and we're taking market share in the process.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken."

And so we were -- what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the cloud. And that does have implications on license because options grew not only -- Database options grew not only double digits but actually 20-something percent. And Analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our cloud.
But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle-specific hardware that's very strategic still continues to do well. But really, the big barn beaters are the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now, OCI and our Database Cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger. And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over 100%, and this kind of -- this now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses -- I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster.
And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then, of course, you have the cases that Larry talked about where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen2 is just so good and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the covers, and it's a very easy extrapolation as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow."

As I mentioned in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018. But if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So the Oracle Autonomous Database was available in our public cloud and has been for 3 years, and it keeps getting better and better. But if you're a big on-premise customer, you didn't have the late -- assets to our latest and greatest database. It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our latest technology was not available to the vast majority of our customers.
All of a sudden, with Cloud at Customer, with Database Cloud at Customer, at very low prices, you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database and have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think the growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version 1. I'll just -- full disclosure, we had a version 1 of this that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version 2 is kind of the extreme opus that we learned a lot. And version 2 is really a plug-and-play. It goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use, incredibly reliable. And we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth, Oracle Database Cloud at Customer.
And the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's 2 ways that -- people are going to make the choice to upgrade and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once in Autonomous Database, they're not going anywhere."

Let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say a few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves, all custom things that are on the Oracle Database, they're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen2, which is powerful enough, secure enough and scalable enough for their crown jewels. And they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future, because often they want to do what we call BYOL, bring your own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads.
Now it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communications industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high-performance applications that run on Oracle, they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it into public cloud. Many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others, are doing Cloud at Customer. And this second generation of Cloud at Customer, now with Autonomous Database, is just so powerful for our customers. So we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications.
And then there are applications that otherwise just run at some of the competing cloud services that when they do, just like Zoom did, like 8x8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network, a lot of compute, may use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performant. And since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack, and it's really very, very, very broad-based for us.
I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about -- add some more to that."

A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle with AWS. They tried. It just didn't work very well. So they've decided maybe they should wait. And so they did. So they did try. They looked around, they experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata cloud service. We have -- Autonomous Database is not available any place but the Oracle Cloud. Exadata database service isn't available any place but the Oracle Cloud. We're much better at -- you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle applications than anybody else, and we are. And a significant percentage of enterprise applications, I don't know, 40% -- 30%, 40% are Oracle applications. So that's just a gigantic installed base that we think is going to be moving to the Oracle -- we're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. That's one fact. So they tried, didn't work. So they're coming to us.
Next thing. A lot of our application customers, we've got well over 7,000 customer -- Fusion application customer -- 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data. Everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle infrastructure services. The Oracle Analytics Cloud is in Oracle infrastructure services, in OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So our application customers, pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become, in the not-too-distant future, infrastructure customers. A lot -- again, and you've got to add them onto it. So these are people that are SaaS customers that are going to become infrastructure customers.
On-premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud at Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are the surprises like Zoom and 8x8. And -- but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performant and economical. They picked it because there's nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them being a SaaS customer. That was just purely an evaluation of our cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon's.
And another example of that is high-performance computing, car companies simulating crashes. Now why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high-performance computing when you can go to Google or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore -- we're much, much faster. And therefore, they get the simulations done faster, but they've got to be willing to pay less. Almost every car -- well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high-performance computing or evaluating our high-performance computing because we benchmark so well against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business.
So the OCI team did a spectacular job of building a second generation, learning from what Microsoft did, what Google did, what Amazon did and then building the next generation. And it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So -- and again -- and these are very early days. Gen2 OCI is relatively new, and Gen2 Cloud at Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years."

We encourage our customers to buy licenses -- buy more licenses. And our pitch is you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the cloud and get big discounts running database in the cloud.
So you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old -- a revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people, we have -- when we see -- ULAs and these big contracts for database, the reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them -- not all of them but a majority of them -- is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our Public Cloud, to Cloud at Customer and getting big discounts, getting a benefit, getting better prices by doing that.

That's why that business is really doing very, very well because the ERP -- everything Fusion, Fusion ERP, HCM, this whole area really growing quickly.
I mean what you see is many of our customers, both E-Business Suite, SQL stuff, JD Edwards customers. But we also see a new phenomena, which is, historically, it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer, too. But now we find that many of those doors are not only can be -- basically are already open for us. So as the only provider of ERP in the cloud for large -- medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers simply because they're really very frustrated with their -- with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So this business for us is an enormous opportunity, and it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact."

Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. I first want to highlight that since",977,"Yes, I'm here. Sorry. Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. 
I first want to highlight that since our own migration to Fusion ERP, we've continued to close our books faster and faster. This quarter, we are reporting our results for our entire global operations 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter. In fact, using Fusion ERP, we submit our 10-K and 10-Q filings faster than any other company in the S&P 500. In fact, 21 days faster than the average. Understanding our business performance sooner is an advantage that we enjoy by use Fusion ERP, and it's one our Fusion customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. 
On to the quarter. So this quarter, revenue was $40 million above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS beat the high end of guidance by $0.04. The impact of currency movement was in line with guidance, meaning that our outperformance reflects both continuing execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations. 
Operating income grew 12%, our best result in 8 years. Our total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Over the last 4 years, we have doubled the percentage of revenue that is being derived from our cloud services. That is what's driving our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue higher and higher, now reaching 73% of total company revenue. We anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services continue to grow. 
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, with strategic back office applications, up 26%; including Fusion ERP, which was up 33%; NetSuite ERP, up 20%; and Fusion HCM, up 24%. Also, retention rates for strategic back office cloud applications, which are already high, continue to go even higher. 
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.2 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue, up 5%. Consumption revenue was up 64% for Autonomous Database and up 139% for OCI, our cloud Gen 2. License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 5%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 2% in USD, up 1% in constant currency. 
As usual, we've continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses down 7% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 billion, up 12% from last year. Obviously, we're delighted with this result as we're continuing to see operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. 
I continue to have a very high level of confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate as our cloud business continues to become a much bigger portion of total revenue. The operating margin percentage was 47%, up more than 450 basis points from 42% last year, and as I said, our best result since 2012. 
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.7%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. EPS was USD 1.06, up 19%, and up 17% in constant currency, despite interest income being $120 million lower than last [ 3 ] [ year ] and interest expense being $135 million higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 17.8% as a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was USD 0.80, up 16% and up 13% in constant currency. 
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.1 billion over the same period. 
Q2 operating cash flow was $1.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion last year, with collections especially strong this quarter from a bigger book of business, and to a lesser extent, delayed payments received from customers affected by the pandemic.  We now have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. 
The short-term deferred revenue balance is unchanged at $8.1 billion. However, the short-term gross deferred revenue grew 6% in U.S. dollars. The difference between the 2 growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. 
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased more than 68 million shares for a total of $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 338 million shares for a total of $18.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 42%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. 
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% positive impact on total revenue, maybe even a little bit more like 1.5ish, and potentially, a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 2% to 4% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 10% to 14% and be between $1.06 and $1.10 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 13% and 17% and be between $1.09 and $1.30 in USD. 
My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20%, but however, as you can see, onetime tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average this year at 20% or so. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we",620,"Thank you, Safra. We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we have supply. To remedy this capacity shortfall, we are adding OCI capacity and building new OCI data centers as fast as we can. We are now up to 29 regional data centers around the world, more than AWS. OCI added customers and grew revenue at a rate well in excess of 100% year-over-year in Q2. The Oracle Autonomous Database was up over 60%. We also introduced several new OCI manager services during the quarter. The most interesting of these new OCI managed services is for the popular open source database, MySQL, featuring an all-new Oracle-developed, massively parallel query accelerator called Heat Wave. MySQL plus Heat Wave processes queries hundreds of times faster, hundreds of times faster than the current version of MySQL by itself and other MySQL-compatible databases, such as Amazon's Aurora. MySQL plus Heatwave is so much faster, so much easier to use and less expensive than Post Rest, Red Shift, Snowflake or any other database available on Amazon AWS. 
The amazing thing about Heat Wave is that you don't have to move your data out of MySQL and build a separate data warehouse to get the huge performance gains. You simply take any existing MySQL or Aurora database, run that exact same database on the new MySQL version that includes Heat Wave, and immediately, your queries run hundreds of times faster. You don't have to change a single line of code. It can't get any easier to use than that. 
Now I'd like to change subject and talk about our multibillion-dollar application businesses in the cloud. Fusion EPS -- Fusion ERP grew 33% in Q2 to over 7,500 customers. NetSuite grew 21% to over 24,000 customers. We have the top-rated ERP products on both Gartner and IDC. 
There is no large-scale enterprise application business in the cloud that's growing as fast as we are. In the coming months, our fab ERP market leadership will become even more obvious when we announce that several major large-scale SAP ERP customers are leading SAP and moving to our Fusion ERP cloud. Work is the clear market leader in cloud ERP. 
Finally, I'd like to talk about our all-new, cloud-based national electronic health record system and health management application suite the Oracle built in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This system has already been used to register more than 0.5 million people for clinical trials run in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. 
Last month, in partnership with the Tony Blair Institute, we used this same exact national electronic health record system to manage the distribution of yellow fever vaccine in Africa. 7,000 people in Ghana were vaccinated during the first week of the program. We're very proud of that. 
We are currently in discussions with dozens of countries around the world to adopt Oracle's new national electronic health record system to modernize their national public health infrastructure, thus enabling efficient COVID-19 vaccine management therapeutic monitoring and diagnostic testing. 
Normally, at this point, I begin to read a list of notable new customers that we acquired during the quarter. But our new more efficient track we'll be to provide you with a list of those customers attached to our detailed financial quarterly numbers. Commercial, you will be able to read the list for yourself and no longer will you have to endure me reading it to you. 
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken."

And so obviously, our hospitality customers have had a very difficult time of it in the main. Some of our retail customers have done horribly, some have done very, very well. 
What has become very clear to our customers is that those that are digitally forward and that can work also under -- with a lot of automation using a digital tool, using our technology, using the cloud, they are faring far, far better. And as a result, we see change occurring. And you can see it in our ERP SaaS numbers, in our HCM numbers, NetSuite numbers. You can just see that those numbers continue to do very, very well. 
And then, of course, our Gen 2 cloud, whether it's compute, where many of our customers are using way more than they expected to, and as Larry said, just blowing out our internal forecast, such that we will need a few more weeks to really catch up with our demand, while we're also expanding globally, simultaneously. So we actually believe that this is -- remains very consistent. Obviously, there was uncertainty before because of the pandemic. At this point, I think it's very clear that our business is accelerating. Our stable businesses remain stable. And our shrinking businesses, whether it's nonstrategic hardware or other things, those continue to get smaller. But generally, the overall revenue number will be showing acceleration even in this pandemic, and I almost feel badly saying, maybe it helped ultimately because many of our customers have realized the importance of using technology to deal with their customers, their employees, their suppliers."

Larry, I've got maybe a bigger question -- a bigger picture question for you. I know you appreciate there are generational aspects to IT, where most often the winner in the last generation isn't the winner in the next. But under your leadership and vision and Safra's operational discipline, Oracle has been an industry leader for over 4 decades by thinking strategically about the future. And today, we hear amazing feedback on Oracle's latest innovations, the actual underlying technology like OCI and autonomous. And by that alone, it would seem the future is bright for Oracle. But we've also seen in the past where the best technology doesn't always win. What gives you confidence that Oracle can remain successful and appeal to a younger generation, many who think cloud-first and want to move really, really fast?"

It is the only",741,"All right. Well, let me start in 2 areas. I've always said there are 2 key aspects of Oracle future, one is the autonomous database, which is a cloud-only product. It works with cloud and cloud and customer. So it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing work much faster than Snowflake -- like the market's current darling. And in transaction processing, we're much faster than anybody. So we have a single unified database that is fully autonomous. It never goes down. It patches itself. Nobody else is making claims anything like that. So we have a vast leadership in -- plus we have, by far, the largest installed base. And our database business continues to grow. Some of our other businesses, our middleware businesses, have declined, but our database business continued to grow throughout the move to the cloud. So we're very confident we're going to hold on to our database franchise. 
We're convinced that -- I mean, they really don't have any strong competition. One of -- and you can see there's not a lot of strong competition from Amazon because what's going on with Snow, you're curious what's happening with Snowflake. Snowflake is a decent product, a good product, I think. And it's just killing Redshift over at Amazon. So it's doing extremely well. But it doesn't remotely compare to Oracle's Autonomous Database. It doesn't do transactions at all. And in fact, in query processing, it's not even close to a SaaS as the Oracle database. So we're -- but it's much better than what Amazon has. And when it's competing inside of AWS, it does very well. It will kill Redshift. Redshift is not very good. But we think we have a huge lead in database. And -- but no one's trying to do it what we're doing. I mean, none of the stuff patches itself. None of the stuff never goes down. That's true. The -- okay, that's holding on to our database franchise. 
The next thing is ERP. SAP forgot to move their ERP system to the cloud. They just built -- they decided instead to go compete with Oracle with HANA. They don't have a cloud product. We have -- if you look at Gartner and SAP, SAP has to be moved off the Gartner list because SAP was in the lower left-hand corner. They're not even considered a cloud system by Gartner SAP for ERP. 
So we are -- we have dominant -- we have over 30,000 customers in the cloud, running our cloud ERP systems. Who's second? Workday with a few hundred? I mean, it's not close. And that's the largest applications business. That's the largest application business on premise, and it will be the largest applications business in the cloud. And we're the overwhelming technology and market leader.  So I think those 2 lynchpins, the Autonomous Database and the Oracle ERP in the cloud, secure our future. 
Now add to that, OCI, which is new for us, we've never been a platform company. We -- Linux is a platform and the old on-premise days. Linux was a platform, Windows was the most famous platform. There was HPUs and IBM operating. So there were a lot of platform. We weren't ever in that business. We were reportable and ran on lots of different platforms. Now we have our own platform for the first time. And our platform is competing very well against AWS and Microsoft. And we think we have way better technology on our platform than the other guys. And we're winning lots and lots of customers to our platform. That's an all-new initiative for us to go into the platform business. 
So again, we're moving from #2 to #1 in cloud applications. Again, we have the fastest-growing, cloud -- large-scale cloud applications business on the planet. 
Who has a multibillion-dollar cloud business that's growing at 33%? I mean, maybe there's somebody, I don't know, know what it is. Who has anything like autonomous database technology? And who has a cloud platform that's being picked by some of the most sophisticated technology companies on earth over AWS and Microsoft? So I guess, those are the 3 pieces. OCI, Autonomous Database and Fusion ERP in the cloud that gives me confidence that we're going to get our fair share of the new generation of cloud applications and infrastructure."

So again, the interesting thing about Cloud at Customer, I'll give the change in our business model. So you've got to remember, when we sign a huge Cloud At Customer deal and we deliver a bunch of Exadatas to a customer, we recognized, let's see, how much revenue? Nothing, versus selling a bunch of Exadatas. So what's happened, remember, we're going from selling Exadata machine to delivering them for free and then charging, if you will, rental or usage on the machines as we go from selling hardware to selling Exadata cloud to customer. So our accounting model, you say, well, wow, Oracle's revenue is flat. Well, flat, maybe not so bad, actually it's growing somewhat. But keep in mind, where we used to get paid for Exadata machines right away, we now deliver them to Cloud at Customer, and we have to wait to get those monthly revenues over a 4- year period. So what you're seeing is this change in model, and Cloud at Customer is already doing pretty well. It's just there's a huge lag. There's histories from the time. There's a lag that time we start selling a bunch of these things until all the revenue starts coming in. So that's what's going on right now, where it's already a very successful product. We're selling a lot of them. Our sales are accelerating, but there's this time lag between sales and the revenue, very different than selling a database license or selling an Exadata machine. As we move to the new model, it's a more profitable model long term, but it doesn't have the instantaneous impact. So there's this time line. And that's what you're saying."

It's got a recommendations engine. And it will tell -- it will also tell the salesperson, what are the best references, what are the best references when you're selling customer A Fusion ERP. And then it will actually go out and find those references and prepare a micro, a website, a micro site for that prospect to go to. So we are enhancing our sales automation which, heretofore, sales automation really has not been about automating sales. Sales automation, which was pioneered by Salesforce.com, sales automation is all about opportunity management and forecasting. Our new sales automation is all about giving salespeople tools, enabling them to sell more. It automatically generates proposals. It automatically generates reference list. It automatically generates micro sites. It automatically generates recommendations of what the salesperson should be selling to this customer next, what module. So these are the kind of products, what we call, automated-lead generation and qualification built into the selling system, the product and reference system. 
We also have another new product that's coming out in CX, which we think is very important, which is the ability to launch an advertising campaign from a computer console without going through ad agencies. This disintermediates the ad business, so that you can, again, target, let's say, we're selling Fusion ERP to an oil company, a large oil company, and we want to advertise to people in that oil company, the decision makers, the CEO, the CFO, people in accounting, all of that. We can then launch an ad campaign, targeting those people and with references for Fusion ERP. So rather than when they log on to look at Google News, rather than them seeing ads for Nike shoes where they were recently browsing the website, they're going to see ads for Oracle Fusion ERP. So we have an ad system. 
So we're doing a bunch of that -- no one by way, no one is doing this but us. We're the only one that's doing this ability to target people and launch ads from a console. We're the only ones that -- I mean, people do it on the consumer side, but not on the B2B side. We're doing that on the B2B side. We're the only ones that are using the recommendation engine, the way that we are, not only to recommend what to Cellnex, but who the best references are and actually preparing the micro site for the prospect to examine those references. 
So I think the CX is a huge opportunity for us. The fact that we have CX linked to our ERP, we have front office linked to our ERP -- linked to our HCM system, is a huge advantage that we have front office, we have HCM, we have back office, we link it all together. It's much more valuable when you have all the front office and back office data in a single database. It allows you to do the kind of innovative things we're doing in the front office. So again, that's -- you're going to see a major improvement in our portfolio in the front office over the coming months."

Our data, we're going to 1 data center, 1 -- an OCI data center that runs not only all of our technology, like Autonomous Database and our high-performance computing, all of that stuff, but it runs all of our applications as well. So we're seeing demand for these products all over the world, and we are going into more countries. We've decided -- our strategy is because we have a large existing business, we have a large existing installed base, we believe we just have to get into more countries than someone than Amazon, let's say, because we have to serve those countries where we have a large installed base, like Indonesia, let's say, which is a very big country, but a lot of people don't have data centers in Indonesia. Israel, I mean, it's very important to get a good data centers in Israel. Some of the cloud companies has been late to get there. We think that's a very important marketplace. So we think we have been building as fast as we can, but we've been trying not to build ahead of demand. And we were doing a pretty good job actually until this last quarter, where demand was actually turned out to exceed our ambitions, where our plan for growth, though it's a very ambitious plan, still on the demand side, we have some large customers that just wanted more capacity than we could supply. And that bid us in Q2. Hopefully, it will be -- as Safra said, we're probably a month or 2 away from correcting that and getting ahead of that curve. But we just see, right now, there's more demand than we can supply. So we're going -- what are we doing? We're going as fast as we possibly can."

And in addition, some of them have extremely a large requirement and are basically a private region. Those aren't in the numbers you were mentioning as far as data center build-outs, but that's another area where we are expanding and consumption is increasing at very, very large rate.

Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.I first want to highlight that since",972,"Yes, I'm here. Sorry. Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.
I first want to highlight that since our own migration to Fusion ERP, we've continued to close our books faster and faster. This quarter, we are reporting our results for our entire global operations 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter. In fact, using Fusion ERP, we submit our 10-K and 10-Q filings faster than any other company in the S&P 500. In fact, 21 days faster than the average. Understanding our business performance sooner is an advantage that we enjoy by use Fusion ERP, and it's one our Fusion customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate.
On to the quarter. So this quarter, revenue was $40 million above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS beat the high end of guidance by $0.04. The impact of currency movement was in line with guidance, meaning that our outperformance reflects both continuing execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations.
Operating income grew 12%, our best result in 8 years. Our total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Over the last 4 years, we have doubled the percentage of revenue that is being derived from our cloud services. That is what's driving our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue higher and higher, now reaching 73% of total company revenue. We anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services continue to grow.
GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, with strategic back-office applications, up 26%, including Fusion ERP, which was up 33%; NetSuite ERP, up 20%; and Fusion HCM, up 24%. Also, retention rates for strategic back-office cloud applications, which are already high, continue to go even higher.
GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.2 billion, up 3%, with database subscription revenue, up 5%. Consumption revenue was up 64% for Autonomous Database and up 139% for OCI, our cloud Gen 2. License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 5%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 2% in USD, up 1% in constant currency. As usual, we've continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses down 7% this quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 billion, up 12% from last year. Obviously, we're delighted with this result as we're continuing to see operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth.
I continue to have a very high level of confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate as our cloud business continues to become a much bigger portion of total revenue. The operating margin percentage was 47%, up more than 450 basis points from 42% last year and, as I said, our best result since 2012.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.7%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.06 in USD, up 19%, and up 17% in constant currency, despite interest income being $120 million lower than last year and interest expense being $135 million higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 17.8% as a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.80 in USD, up 16% and up 13% in constant currency.
Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.1 billion over the same period.
Q2 operating cash flow was $1.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion last year, with collections especially strong this quarter from a bigger book of business and, to a lesser extent, delayed payments received from customers affected by the pandemic. We now have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities.
The short-term deferred revenue balance is unchanged at $8.1 billion. However, the short-term gross deferred revenue grew 6% in U.S. dollars. The difference between the 2 growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased more than 68 million shares for a total of $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 338 million shares for a total of $18.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 42%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24.
Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% positive impact on total revenue, maybe even a little bit more like 1.5-ish and potentially, a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 2% to 4% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 10% to 14% and be between $1.06 and $1.10 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 13% and 17% and be between $1.09 and $1.30 in USD.
My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20%, but however, as you can see, onetime tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average this year at 20% or so.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments."

We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we",630,"Thank you, Safra. We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we have supply. To remedy this capacity shortfall, we are adding OCI capacity and building new OCI data centers as fast as we can. We are now up to 29 regional data centers around the world, more than AWS. OCI added customers and grew revenue at a rate well in excess of 100% year-over-year in Q2. The Oracle Autonomous Database was up over 60%.
We also introduced several new OCI managed services during the quarter. The most interesting of these new OCI managed services is for the popular open source database, MySQL, featuring an all-new, Oracle-developed, massively parallel query accelerator called [ Heat Wave ]. MySQL plus [ Heat Wave ] processes queries hundreds of times faster, hundreds of times faster than the current version of MySQL by itself and other MySQL-compatible databases, such as Amazon's Aurora. MySQL plus [ Heat Wave ] is so much faster, so much easier to use and less expensive than PostgreS, Redshift, Snowflake or any other database available on Amazon AWS.
The amazing thing about [ Heat Wave ] is that you don't have to move your data out of MySQL and build a separate data warehouse to get the huge performance gains. You simply take any existing MySQL or Aurora database, run that exact same database on the new MySQL version that includes [ Heat Wave ], and immediately, your queries run hundreds of times faster. You don't have to change a single line of code. It can't get any easier to use than that.
Now I'd like to change subject and talk about our multibillion-dollar application businesses in the cloud. Fusion EPS -- Fusion ERP grew 33% in Q2 to over 7,500 customers. NetSuite grew 21% to over 24,000 customers. We have the top-rated ERP products on both Gartner and IDC.
There is no large-scale enterprise application business in the cloud that's growing as fast as we are. In the coming months, our cloud ERP market leadership will become even more obvious when we announce that several major large-scale SAP ERP customers are leaving SAP and moving to our Fusion ERP cloud. Oracle is the clear market leader in cloud ERP.
Finally, I'd like to talk about our all-new, cloud-based national electronic health record system and health management application suite that Oracle built in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This system has already been used to register more than 0.5 million people for clinical trials run in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies.
Last month, in partnership with the Tony Blair Institute, we used this same exact national electronic health record system to manage the distribution of yellow fever vaccine in Africa. 7,000 people in Ghana were vaccinated during the first week of the program. We're very proud of that.
We are currently in discussions with dozens of countries around the world to adopt Oracle's new national electronic health record system to modernize their national public health infrastructure, thus enabling efficient COVID-19 vaccine management therapeutic monitoring and diagnostic testing.
Normally, at this point, I'd begin to read a list of notable new customers that we acquired during the quarter. But our new more efficient track will be to provide you with a list of those customers attached to our detailed financial quarterly numbers. So immersively, you will be able to read the list for yourself and no longer will you have to endure me reading it to you.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken."

And so obviously, our hospitality customers have had a very difficult time of it in the main. Some of our retail customers have done horribly. Some have done very, very well.
What has become very clear to our customers is that those that are digitally forward and that can work also under -- with a lot of automation using a digital tool, using our technology, using the cloud, they are faring far, far better. And as a result, we see change occurring. And you can see it in our ERP SaaS numbers, in our HCM numbers, NetSuite numbers, you can just see that those numbers continue to do very, very well.
And then, of course, our Gen 2 cloud, whether it's compute where many of our customers are using way more than they expected to and, as Larry said, just blowing out our internal forecast such that we will need a few more weeks to really catch up with our demand while we're also expanding globally simultaneously. So we actually believe that this remains very consistent. Obviously, there was uncertainty before because of the pandemic. At this point, I think it's very clear that our business is accelerating. Our stable businesses remain stable. And our shrinking businesses, whether it's nonstrategic hardware or other things, those continue to get smaller.
But generally, the overall revenue number will be showing acceleration even in this pandemic, and I almost feel badly saying, maybe it helped ultimately because many of our customers have realized the importance of using technology to deal with their customers, their employees, their suppliers."

I know you appreciate there are generational aspects to IT where, most often, the winner in the last generation isn't the winner in the next. But under your leadership and vision and Safra's operational discipline, Oracle has been an industry leader for over 4 decades by thinking strategically about the future. And today, we hear amazing feedback on Oracle's latest innovations, the actual underlying technology like OCI and Autonomous. And by that alone, it would seem the future is bright for Oracle. But we've also seen in the past that the best technology doesn't always win. What gives you confidence that Oracle can remain successful and appeal to a younger generation, many who think cloud-first and want to move really, really fast?"

It works with Cloud and Cloud at Customer. So it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market's current darling. And in transaction processing, we're much faster than anybody. So we have a single unified database that is fully autonomous. It never goes down. It patches itself. Nobody else is making claims anything like that.
So we have a vast leadership in -- plus we have, by far, the largest installed base. And our database business continues to grow. Some of our other businesses, our middleware businesses, have declined, but our database business continued to grow throughout the move to the cloud. So we're very confident we're going to hold on to our database franchise. We're convinced that -- I mean, they really don't have any strong competition.
One of -- and you can see there's not a lot of strong competition from Amazon because what's going on with Snow -- if you're curious what's happening with Snowflake, Snowflake is a decent product, a good product, I think. And it's just killing Redshift over at Amazon. So it's doing extremely well. But it doesn't remotely compare to Oracle's Autonomous Database. It doesn't do transactions at all. And in fact, query processing is not even close to assess as the Oracle database. So we're -- but it's much better than what Amazon has. And when it's competing inside of AWS, it does very well. It will kill Redshift. Redshift is not very good. So we think we have a huge lead in database. And -- but no one's trying to do what we're doing. I mean none of the stuff patches itself. None of the stuff never goes down. That's true. The -- okay, that's holding on to our database franchise.
The next thing is ERP. SAP forgot to move their ERP system to the cloud. They just built -- they decided instead to go compete with Oracle with HANA. They don't have a cloud product. We have -- if you look at Gartner and SAP, SAP asked to be moved off the Gartner list because SAP was in the lower left-hand corner. They're not even considered a cloud system by Gartner SAP for ERP. So we are -- we have dominant -- we have over 30,000 customers in the cloud, running our cloud ERP systems. Who's second? Workday with a few hundred? I mean it's not close. And that's the largest applications business. That's the largest applications business on-premise, and it will be the largest applications business in the cloud, and we're the overwhelming technology and market leader. So I think those 2 lynchpins, the Autonomous Database and the Oracle ERP in the cloud secure our future.
Now add to that, OCI, which is new for us, we've never been a platform company. We -- Linux is a platform. In the old on-premise days, Linux was a platform, Windows was the most famous platform. There was HP-UX and IBM [ Metazone ] offering. So there were a lot of platforms. We weren't ever in that business. We were portable and ran on lots of different platforms. Now we have our own platform for the first time. And our platform is competing very well against AWS and Microsoft, and we think we have way better technology on our platform than the other guys. And we're winning lots and lots of customers to our platform. That's an all-new initiative for us to go into the platform business.
So again, we're moving from #2 to #1 in cloud applications. Again, we have the fastest-growing, cloud -- large-scale cloud applications business on the planet.  Who has a multibillion-dollar cloud business that's growing at 33%? I mean maybe there's somebody, I don't know who it is. Who has anything like autonomous database technology? And who has a cloud platform that's being picked by some of the most sophisticated technology companies on earth over AWS and Microsoft? So I guess those are the 3 pieces: OCI, Autonomous Database and Fusion ERP in the cloud that gives me confidence that we're going to get our fair share of the new generation of cloud applications and infrastructure."

So again, the interesting thing about Cloud at Customer, the change in our business model. So you've got to remember, when we sign a huge Cloud at Customer deal and we deliver a bunch of Exadata to a customer, we recognized, let's see, how much revenue, nothing, versus selling a bunch of Exadata. So what's happened -- remember, we're going from selling Exadata machine to delivering them for free and then charging, if you will, rental or usage on the machines as we go from selling hardware to selling Exadata Cloud at Customer.
So our accounting model, you say, well, wow, Oracle's revenue is flat. Well, flat, maybe not so bad, actually it's growing somewhat. But keep in mind, where we used to get paid for Exadata machines right away, we now deliver them at Cloud at Customer, and we have to wait to get those monthly revenues over a 4-year period. So what you're seeing is this change in model, and Cloud at Customer is already doing pretty well. It's just there's a huge lag. There's histories. From the time -- there's a lag from the time we start selling a bunch of these things until all the revenue starts coming in.
So that's what's going on right now where it's already a very successful product. We're selling a lot of them. Our sales are accelerating, but there's this time lag between sales and the revenue, very different than selling a database license or selling an Exadata machine. As we move to the new model, it's a more profitable model long term, but it doesn't have the instantaneous impact. So there's this time lag. And that's what you're seeing."

22247,696942785,2162187,"Oracle Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 10, 2020",2020-12-10,"Earnings Calls","Oracle Corporation","Executives","Yes. Well, they are actually because we're making -- actually, I've been directly involved with a major push in CX. And we've come out with several new CX products, one of which is our product and references system where we have a product references datab",613,"Yes. Well, they are actually because we're making -- actually, I've been directly involved with a major push in CX. And we've come out with several new CX products, one of which is our product and references system where we have a product references database that we sell, and we have an AI engine that sits on top of it. And what it does, it tells -- it interfaces to our sales automation system. And it tells customers or it tells salespeople what product they should be selling this particular customer next. It's got a recommendations engine. And it will tell -- it will also tell the salesperson what are the best references when you're selling customer A Fusion ERP. And then it will actually -- go out and find those references and prepare a micro -- a website, a micro site for that prospect to go to.
So we are enhancing our sales automation which, heretofore, sales automation really has not been about automating sales. Sales automation, which was pioneered by salesforce.com, sales automation is all about opportunity management and forecasting. Our new sales automation is all about giving salespeople tools, enabling them to sell more. It automatically generates proposals. It automatically generates reference list. It automatically generates micro sites. It automatically generates recommendations of what the salesperson should be selling to this customer next, what module. So these are the kind of products, what we call automated lead generation and qualification built into the selling system, the product reference system.
We also have another new product that's coming out in CX, which we think is very important, which is the ability to launch an advertising campaign from a computer console without going through ad agencies. It's funny, this disintermediates the ad business, so that you can, again, target -- let's say, we're selling Fusion ERP to an oil company, a large oil company, and we want to advertise to people in that oil company, the decision makers, the CEO, the CFO, people in accounting, all of that, we can then launch an ad campaign targeting those people and with references for Fusion ERP. So rather than when they log on to look at Google News, rather than them seeing ads for Nike shoes where they were recently browsing the website, they're going to see ads for Oracle Fusion ERP. So we have an ad system.
So we're doing a bunch of that -- by the way, no one is doing this but us. We're the only one that's doing this ability to target people and launch ads from a console. We're the only ones that -- I mean people do it on the consumer side but not on the B2B side. We're doing that on the B2B side. We're the only ones that are using the recommendation engine the way that we are not only to recommend what to sell next but who the best references are and actually preparing the micro site for the prospects to examine those references.
So I think the CX is a huge opportunity for us. The fact that we have CX linked to our ERP, we have front office linked to our ERP, linked to our HCM system, it's a huge advantage that we have front office, we have HCM, we have back office, we link it all together. It's much more valuable when you have all the front office and back-office data in a single database. It allows you to do the kind of innovative things we're doing in the front office. So again, that's -- you're going to see a major improvement in our portfolio in the front office over the coming months."

Our data -- we're going to 1 data center, an OCI data center, that runs not only all of our technology, like Autonomous Database and our high-performance computing, all of that stuff, but it runs all of our applications as well. So we're seeing demand for these products all over the world, and we are going into more countries. We've decided -- our strategy is, because we have a large existing business, we have a large existing installed base, we believe we just have to get into more countries than someone -- than Amazon, let's say, because we have to serve those countries where we have a large installed base, like Indonesia, let's say, which is a very big country, but a lot of people don't have data centers in Indonesia.
Israel, I mean, it's very important to get a good data center in Israel. Some of the cloud companies has been late to get there. We think that's a very important marketplace. So we think we have been building as fast as we can, but we've been trying not to build ahead of demand. And we were doing a pretty good job actually until this last quarter where demand was actually turned out to exceed our ambitions, where our plan for growth, though it's a very ambitious plan, still on the demand side, we have some large customers that just wanted more capacity than we could supply. And that bit us in Q2. Hopefully, it will be -- as Safra said, we're probably a month or 2 away from correcting that and getting ahead of that curve. But we just see right now there's more demand than we can supply. So we're going -- as I said, what are we doing? We're going as fast as we possibly can."
