Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Ou",528,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Our same-store occupancy ended the year at 92.4%, the highest year-end mark since 2015. Our same-store revenue increased 3.5%, NOI increased 2.9% and core FFO growth per share increased 4.5%, demonstrating the durability of our diversified portfolio and the progress of our platform and team. 
We had impressive external growth, acquiring 47 stores with an additional 177 stores added to our third-party management platform. The majority of these stores were new to the platform, meaning we brought a new property into the system every 1.3 business days on average. We also found other innovative ways to enhance our external growth, including redevelopment and net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, a preferred equity investment with SmartStop and the launch of a new bridge loan program. All of these efforts helped Extra Space invest approximately $650 million at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
The fourth quarter not only marks the end of another solid year, but an incredible decade of performance. Over that time, we grew our store count by more than 1,000 stores, an increase of 137%. We developed proprietary technology that helped us optimize performance and consistently outperform our peers. We delevered our balance sheet and achieved a BBB stable rating from S&P. Most importantly, Extra Space Storage provided the highest 10-year return to shareholders of any publicly traded REIT and the 11th highest of all companies in the S&P 500, regardless of sector. 
We are proud of the growth we experienced over the past 10 years and the value it created for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors, lenders and partners who contributed to our growth and success over the past decade. We also acknowledge the vital contributions, hard work and dedication of over 4,000 employees who made such performance possible. The culture and values of this team led us to be named a top 100 best place to work by Glassdoor out of over 1 million companies. While we are proud of our accomplishments, and while we believe it is important to celebrate our past successes, we are even more focused on the future. Most of the headwinds faced in 2019 will continue to be present in 2020. The supply cycle, we find ourselves in, will continue to dampen performance, but it is moderating and will reverse. But even while in the depths of this cycle, we are in an incredible business, marked by high occupancies, increasing customer demand, longer average length of stay used by all age demographics, no real disruptor on the horizon and an increasing advantage of the large operators over the mom-and-pops. The stable and increasing cash flows we have all enjoyed continue to be a hallmark of self storage. We are committed to leveraging our experience, our technological sophistication and our diversified portfolio to continue to provide solid returns in 2020 and in the decade ahead of us. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance",449,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance revenue were in line with expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth and higher occupancy with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax, marketing expense and payroll. We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. After obtaining our BBB credit rating from S&P, we now qualify for improved pricing on our credit facility that will lower interest expense going forward. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2020. Our new same-store pool will increase by 42 stores for a total of 863 stores. We expect the change in the same-store pool to benefit our revenue growth by only 10 basis points or less over the year. We experienced gradual moderation in our same-store revenue growth through the end of 2019 due to new supply and expect that moderation to continue into 2020. Same-store revenue growth is expected to increase 0.75% to 1.75%. 2020 same-store expense growth is expected to increase 4% to 5%. We do not expect as much pressure from property taxes and marketing expenses in 2020, but we do expect them to continue to be outsized. 
The projected increases in property taxes are heavily weighted to Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. In addition, we anticipate higher payroll expense due to a difficult 2019 comp. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth expectations of negative 0.5% on the low end of the range to a positive 1% on the high end. For 2020, we expect to invest $230 million in acquisitions, approximately $55 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to invest an additional $60 million in bridge loans. Our guidance assumes external growth will be financed with net operating income and debt. As always, we are committed to being disciplined, but we will be opportunistic and innovative in seeking additional ways to grow externally. We have plenty of liquidity and capacity and will proactively pursue accretive growth opportunities as they become available. 
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.99 to $5.08 per share. In 2020, we anticipate $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.13 of dilution from CFO stores for total dilution of $0.20, down $0.03 from 2019 levels. 
With that, let's now turn it over to Latif to start our question-and-answer session."

I think it's important that we be clear about what marketing spend is. Marketing spend is akin to an investment. But when we choose to spend marketing dollars, we're doing so because we can track a positive ROI on that dollar. And marketing spend is less than 3% of revenue for us. So it doesn't have a giant impact when you have a high-margin business and you can generate rentals by that spend. That being said, our 2020 budget do have a moderate increase in marketing spend. We will see and feel a greater impact of that increase, excuse me, in the first quarter due to a bad comp with first quarter 2019. But we do have a moderate impact over the life of the year. And frankly, if we end up spending more than our budgets say we do, it's because we chose to spend that money and we believe it's going to have and we know it's going to have a good return."

But it's pretty similar to what we've done throughout the entire year. The quarter looked a little different because it's when we lapped our current discounting policy with how we did things last year. So discounting had less of a benefit in the fourth quarter than it had for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our discounting trend in 2020 is assumed to be very similar to what we did in 2019. If you look at rates in 2019, you probably need to start at the first of the year. But at the first of the year, we had low to mid single-digit rate growth and our occupancy fell. So by mid-year, we were about 50 basis points below year-over-year in our occupancy. And we made a decision to be a little bit more aggressive not only in marketing spend but also in our -- on our rate. So starting with July 4, we ran a special where we dropped rates 7% or 8% during the month of July and primarily related with that special is when we started doing that and we would tell you it worked. The additional marketing spend and the lower rates in July caused occupancy to jump. We then pushed rates up throughout the remainder of the year and finished the year close to flat. So we were slightly negative on our achieved rates, but our occupancy grew by about 140 basis points from the end of June through the end of the year. So that combination of increased marketing spend and lower rates caused occupancy to grow. And towards the end of the year as we push rates back up to closer to flat, we continued to maintain that occupancy and actually expanded it a little bit."

And we're entering into this year with $54 million, $55 million worth of deals in the pipeline. So we have less -- kind of less in the bag that we know is going to come about. A lot of that is due to we significantly slowed down our commitments to co deals and developments several years ago. So there's much fewer of those delivering now. And that turned out to be a good decision. I'm happy we don't have more new product being delivered into today's market. On the acquisitions side, we see very few leased, stable, good properties, good mark -- good markets on the market. There's just very few of those. Most of what we see in the market are stores that are in some stage of lease-up, and we price those and bid on them. But our view of lease-up and the future returns on those is less than the market. And frankly, we're not very competitive. And we don't rely on being an active purchaser of broker deals in 2020, just like we weren't in 2019 and prior years. So that means we're going to have to get creative, and we're going to have to try to talk to a lot of people in the market and see what their needs are and find the capital voids and see how we can use our advantages and try to create deals that produce accretive long-term value for our shareholders. And I can't tell you what that is, just like I couldn't tell you in the beginning of 2019 that we were going to do a preferred equity investment, where then our bridge loan program was going to be so successful or that, I guess, we were talking to W.P. Carey at that time, but we didn't know we were going to ultimately get to a deal. So I can't give you specifics of how we're going to grow externally, but I do tell you we got a bunch of smart people who are working every day out in the market trying to create good deals for us."

Thank you, everyone, for your participation today and interest in Extra Space Storage. We certainly understand everyone's concern over declining revenue growth and the impact of new supply in the market. However, I think it's important to step back and look at some big picture items. Even in the toughest part of the development cycle, we project to deliver over 4% core FFO growth, which, given where we are, I would say, is not a bad result. We can do so because we have many tools, including innovative ways to grow to support this FFO growth, and we'll continue to explore and execute smart innovative strategies with good risk-adjusted returns. Even with all this new supply delivered, we are at an extremely high occupancy, and this is a direct result of our ability to acquire customers. Our machine works. We have positive same-store revenue growth, even though 2/3 of our property have had new supply delivered in their markets. We have an improved rated, flexible balance sheet and access to multiple sources of debt and equity capital that will allow us to take advantage of opportunities presented in the market. And we've been disciplined in the acquisition market. We're not stretching to get deals. We're not buying things just to grow. We're remaining very disciplined. We continue to grow our management plus business without compromising our pricing structure. So I know we're in difficult times, but I am very excited about our opportunity to outperform in 2020 and beyond. Thank you very much."

We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Ou",528,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Our same-store occupancy ended the year at 92.4%, the highest year-end mark since 2015. Our same-store revenue increased 3.5%, NOI increased 2.9% and core FFO growth per share increased 4.5%, demonstrating the durability of our diversified portfolio and the progress of our platform and team. 
We had impressive external growth, acquiring 47 stores with an additional 177 stores added to our third-party management platform. The majority of these stores were new to the platform, meaning we brought a new property into the system every 1.3 business days on average. We also found other innovative ways to enhance our external growth, including redevelopment and net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, a preferred equity investment with SmartStop and the launch of a new bridge loan program. All of these efforts helped Extra Space invest approximately $650 million at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
The fourth quarter not only marks the end of another solid year, but an incredible decade of performance. Over that time, we grew our store count by more than 1,000 stores, an increase of 137%. We developed proprietary technology that helped us optimize performance and consistently outperform our peers. We delevered our balance sheet and achieved a BBB stable rating from S&P. Most importantly, Extra Space Storage provided the highest 10-year return to shareholders of any publicly traded REIT and the 11th highest of all companies in the S&P 500, regardless of sector. 
We are proud of the growth we experienced over the past 10 years and the value it created for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors, lenders and partners who contributed to our growth and success over the past decade. We also acknowledge the vital contributions, hard work and dedication of over 4,000 employees who made such performance possible. The culture and values of this team led us to be named in top 100 best place to work by Glassdoor out of over 1 million companies. While we are proud of our accomplishments, and while we believe it is important to celebrate our past successes, we are even more focused on the future. Most of the headwinds faced in 2019 will continue to be present in 2020. The supply cycle, we find ourselves in, will continue to dampen performance, but it is moderating and will reverse. But even while in the depths of this cycle, we are in an incredible business, marked by high occupancies, increasing customer demand, longer average length of stay used by all age demographics, no real disruptor on the horizon and an increasing advantage of the large operators over the mom-and-pops. The stable and increasing cash flows we have all enjoyed continue to be a hallmark of self storage. We are committed to leveraging our experience, our technological sophistication and our diversified portfolio to continue to provide solid returns in 2020 and in the decade ahead of us. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance",449,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance revenue were in line with expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth and higher occupancy with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax, marketing expense and payroll. We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. After obtaining our BBB credit rating from S&P, we now qualify for improved pricing on our credit facility that will lower interest expense going forward. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2020. Our new same-store pool will increase by 42 stores for a total of 863 stores. We expect the change in the same-store pool to benefit our revenue growth by only 10 basis points or less over the year. We experienced gradual moderation in our same-store revenue growth through the end of 2019 due to new supply and expect that moderation to continue into 2020. Same-store revenue growth is expected to increase 0.75% to 1.75%. 2020 same-store expense growth is expected to increase 4% to 5%. We do not expect as much pressure from property taxes and marketing expenses in 2020, but we do expect them to continue to be outsized. 
The projected increases in property taxes are heavily weighted to Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. In addition, we anticipate higher payroll expense due to a difficult 2019 comp. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth expectations of negative 0.5% on the low end of the range to a positive 1% on the high end. For 2020, we expect to invest $230 million in acquisitions, approximately $55 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to invest an additional $60 million in bridge loans. Our guidance assumes external growth will be financed with net operating income and debt. As always, we are committed to being disciplined, but we will be opportunistic and innovative in seeking additional ways to grow externally. We have plenty of liquidity and capacity and will proactively pursue accretive growth opportunities as they become available. 
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.99 to $5.08 per share. In 2020, we anticipate $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.13 of dilution from CFO stores for total dilution of $0.20, down $0.03 from 2019 levels. 
With that, let's now turn it over to Latif to start our question-and-answer session."

But when we choose to spend marketing dollars, we're doing so because we can track a positive ROI on that dollars. And marketing spend is less than 3% of revenue for us. So it doesn't have a giant impact when you have a high-margin business and you can generate rentals by that spend. That being said, our 2020 budgets do have a moderate increase in marketing spend. We will see and feel a greater impact of that increase, excuse me, in the first quarter due to a bad comp with first quarter 2019. But we do have a moderate impact over the life of the year. And frankly, if we end up spending more than our budgets say we do, it's because we chose to spend that money and we believe it's going to have and we know it's going to have a good return."

But it's pretty similar to what we've done throughout the entire year. The quarter looked a little different because it's when we lapped our current discounting policy with how we did things last year. So discounting had less of a benefit in the fourth quarter than it had for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our discounting trend in 2020 is assumed to be very similar to what we did in 2019. If you look at rates in 2019, you probably need to start at the first of the year. At the first of the year, we had low to mid single-digit rate growth and our occupancy fell. So by mid-year, we were about 50 basis points below year-over-year in our occupancy. And we made a decision to be a little bit more aggressive not only in marketing spend but also in our -- on our rate. So starting with July 4, we ran a special where we dropped rates 7% or 8% during the month of July and primarily related with that special is when we started doing that and we tell you it worked. The additional marketing spend and the lower rates in July caused occupancy to jump. We then pushed rates up throughout the remainder of the year and finished the year close to flat. So we were slightly negative on our achieved rates, but our occupancy grew by about 140 basis points from the end of June through the end of the year. So that combination of increased marketing spend and lower rates caused occupancy to grow. And towards the end of the year as we push rates back up to closer to flat, we continued to maintain that occupancy and actually expanded it a little bit."

A lot of that is due to we significantly slowed down our commitments to CO deals and developments several years ago. So there's much fewer of those delivering now. And that turned out to be a good decision. I'm happy we don't have more new product being delivered into today's market. On the acquisitions side, we see very few leased, stable, good properties, good mark -- good markets on the market. There's just very few of those. Most of what we see in the market are stores that are in some stage of lease-up, and we price those and bid on them. But our view of lease-up and the future returns on those is less than the market. And frankly, we're not very competitive. And we don't rely on being an active purchaser of broker deals in 2020, just like we weren't in 2019 and prior years. So that means we're going to have to get creative, and we're going to have to try to talk to a lot of people in the market and see what their needs are and find the capital voids and see how we can use our advantages and try to create deals that produce accretive long-term value for our shareholders. And I can't tell you what that is, just like I couldn't tell you in the beginning of 2019 that we were going to do a preferred equity investment, whether our bridge loan program was going to be so successful or that, I guess, we were talking to W.P.

We certainly understand everyone's concern over declining revenue growth and the impact of new supply in the market. However, I think it's important to step back and look at some big picture items. Even in the toughest part of the development cycle, we project to deliver over 4% core FFO growth, which, given where we are, I would say, is not a bad result. We can do so because we have many tools, including innovative ways to grow to support this FFO growth, and we'll continue to explore and execute smart innovative strategies with good risk-adjusted returns. Even with all this new supply delivered, we are at an extremely high occupancy, and this is a direct result of our ability to acquire customers. Our machine works. We have positive same-store revenue growth, even though 2/3 of our property have had new supply delivered in their markets. We have an improved rated, flexible balance sheet and access to multiple sources of debt and equity capital that will allow us to take advantage of opportunities presented in the market. And we've been disciplined in the acquisition market. We're not stretching to get deals. We're not buying things just to grow. We're remaining very disciplined, and we continue to grow our management plus business without compromising our pricing structure. So I know we're in difficult times, but I am very excited about our opportunity to outperform in 2020 and beyond. Thank you very much."

Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Our same-store occupancy ended the year at 92.4%, the highest year-end mark since 2015. Our same-store revenue increased 3.5%, NOI increased 2.9% and core FFO growth per share increased 4.5%, demonstrating the durability of our diversified portfolio and the progress of our platform and team. 
We had impressive external growth, acquiring 47 stores with an additional 177 stores added to our third-party management platform. The majority of these stores were new to the platform, meaning we brought a new property into the system every 1.3 business days on average. We also found other innovative ways to enhance our external growth, including redevelopment and net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, a preferred equity investment with SmartStop and the launch of a new bridge loan program. All of these efforts helped Extra Space invest approximately $650 million at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
The fourth quarter not only marks the end of another solid year, but an incredible decade of performance. Over that time, we grew our store count by more than 1,000 stores, an increase of 137%. We developed proprietary technology that helped us optimize performance and consistently outperform our peers. We delevered our balance sheet and achieved a BBB stable rating from S&P. Most importantly, Extra Space Storage provided the highest 10-year return to shareholders of any publicly traded REIT and the 11th highest of all companies in the S&P 500, regardless of sector. 
We are proud of the growth we experienced over the past 10 years and the value it created for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors, lenders and partners who contributed to our growth and success over the past decade. We also acknowledge the vital contributions, hard work and dedication of over 4,000 employees who made such performance possible. The culture and values of this team led us to be named in top 100 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor out of over 1 million companies.
While we are proud of our accomplishments, and while we believe it is important to celebrate our past successes, we are even more focused on the future. Most of the headwinds faced in 2019 will continue to be present in 2020. The supply cycle, we find ourselves in, will continue to dampen performance, but it is moderating and will reverse. But even while in the depths of this cycle, we are in an incredible business, marked by high occupancies, increasing customer demand, longer average lengths of stay used by all age demographics, no real disruptor on the horizon and an increasing advantage of the large operators over the mom-and-pops. The stable and increasing cash flows we have all enjoyed continue to be a hallmark of self storage. We are committed to leveraging our experience, our technological sophistication and our diversified portfolio to continue to provide solid returns in 2020 and in the decade ahead of us. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance",451,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance revenue were in line with expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth and higher occupancy with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax, marketing expense and payroll. We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. After obtaining our BBB credit rating from S&P, we now qualify for improved pricing on our credit facility that will lower interest expense going forward. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2020. Our new same-store pool will increase by 42 stores for a total of 863 stores. We expect the change in the same-store pool to benefit our revenue growth by only 10 basis points or less over the year. We experienced gradual moderation in our same-store revenue growth through the end of 2019 due to new supply and expect that moderation to continue into 2020. Same-store revenue growth is expected to increase 0.75% to 1.75%. 2020 same-store expense growth is expected to increase 4% to 5%. We do not expect as much pressure from property taxes and marketing expenses in 2020, but we do expect them to continue to be outsized. 
The projected increases in property taxes are heavily weighted to Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. In addition, we anticipate higher payroll expense due to a difficult 2019 comp. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth expectations of negative 0.5% on the low end of the range to a positive 1% on the high end. For 2020, we expect to invest $230 million in acquisitions, approximately $55 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to invest an additional $60 million in bridge loans. Our guidance assumes external growth will be financed with net operating income and debt. As always, we are committed to being disciplined, but we will be opportunistic and innovative in seeking additional ways to grow externally. We have plenty of liquidity and capacity and will proactively pursue accretive growth opportunities as they become available. 
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.99 to $5.08 per share. In 2020, we anticipate $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.13 of dilution from C of O stores for total dilution of $0.20, down $0.03 from 2019 levels. 
With that, let's now turn it over to Latif to start our question-and-answer session."

I think it's important that we be clear about what marketing spend is. Marketing spend is akin to an investment. When we choose to spend marketing dollars, we're doing so because we can track a positive ROI on that dollars. And marketing spend is less than 3% of revenue for us. So it doesn't have a giant impact when you have a high-margin business and you can generate rentals by that spend. That being said, our 2020 budgets do have a moderate increase in marketing spend. We will see and feel a greater impact of that increase, excuse me, in the first quarter due to a bad comp with first quarter 2019. But we do have a moderate impact over the life of the year. And frankly, if we end up spending more than our budgets say we do, it's because we chose to spend that money and we believe it's going to have and we know it's going to have a good return."

But it's pretty similar to what we've done throughout the entire year. The quarter looked a little different because it's when we lapped our current discounting policy with how we did things last year. So discounting had less of a benefit in the fourth quarter than it had for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our discounting trend in 2020 is assumed to be very similar to what we did in 2019.

So by mid-year, we were about 50 basis points below year-over-year in our occupancy. And we made a decision to be a little bit more aggressive not only in marketing spend but also in our -- on our rate. So starting with July 4, we ran a special where we dropped rates 7% or 8% during the month of July and primarily related with that special is when we started doing that, and we tell you it worked. The additional marketing spend and the lower rates in July caused occupancy to jump. We then pushed rates up throughout the remainder of the year and finished the year close to flat. So we were slightly negative on our achieved rates, but our occupancy grew by about 140 basis points from the end of June through the end of the year. So that combination of increased marketing spend and lower rates caused occupancy to grow. And towards the end of the year as we push rates back up to closer to flat, we continued to maintain that occupancy and actually expanded it a little bit."

So I think it's important to recall that we went into 2019 with over $300 million of deals in the pipeline. And we're entering into this year with $54 million, $55 million worth of deals in the pipeline. So we have less -- kind of less in the bag that we know is going to come about. A lot of that is due to we significantly slowed down our commitments to CO deals and developments several years ago. So there's much fewer of those delivering now. And that turned out to be a good decision. I'm happy we don't have more new product being delivered into today's market. On the acquisition side, we see very few, least stable, good properties, good markets on the market. There's just very few of those. Most of what we see in the market are stores that are in some stage of lease-up, and we price those and bid on them. But our view of the lease-up and the future returns on those is less than the market. And frankly, we're not very competitive. And we don't rely on being an active purchaser of broker deals in 2020, just like we weren't in 2019 and prior years. So that means we're going to have to get creative, and we're going to have to try to talk to a lot of people in the market and see what their needs are and find the capital voids and see how we can use our advantages and try to create deals that produce accretive long-term value for our shareholders. And I can't tell you what that is, just like I couldn't tell you in the beginning of 2019 that we were going to do a preferred equity investment, whether our bridge loan program was going to be so successful or that, I guess, we were talking to W.P. Carey at that time, but we didn't know we were going to ultimately get to a deal. So I can't give you specifics of how we're going to grow externally, but I do tell you we got a bunch of smart people who are working every day out in the market trying to create good deals for us."

Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Ou",527,"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter and year-end call, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space Storage. We delivered solid results in 2019 despite significant competition from new supply and for external growth. Our same-store occupancy ended the year at 92.4%, the highest year-end mark since 2015. Our same-store revenue increased 3.5%, NOI increased 2.9% and core FFO growth per share increased 4.5%, demonstrating the durability of our diversified portfolio and the progress of our platform and team. 
We had impressive external growth, acquiring 47 stores with an additional 177 stores added to our third-party management platform. The majority of these stores were new to the platform, meaning we brought a new property into the system every 1.3 business days on average. We also found other innovative ways to enhance our external growth, including redevelopment and net lease transaction with W.P. Carey, a preferred equity investment with SmartStop and the launch of a new bridge loan program. All of these efforts helped Extra Space invest approximately $650 million at attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
The fourth quarter not only marks the end of another solid year, but an incredible decade of performance. Over that time, we grew our store count by more than 1,000 stores, an increase of 137%. We developed proprietary technology that helped us optimize performance and consistently outperform our peers. We delevered our balance sheet and achieved a BBB stable rating from S&P. Most importantly, Extra Space Storage provided the highest 10-year return to shareholders of any publicly traded REIT and the 11th highest of all companies in the S&P 500, regardless of sector. 
We are proud of the growth we experienced over the past 10 years and the value it created for our shareholders. We appreciate the support of our investors, lenders and partners who contributed to our growth and success over the past decade. We also acknowledge the vital contributions, hard work and dedication of over 4,000 employees who made such performance possible. The culture and values of this team led us to be named in top 100 Best Place to Work by Glassdoor out of over 1 million companies.
While we are proud of our accomplishments, and while we believe it is important to celebrate our past successes, we are even more focused on the future. Most of the headwinds faced in 2019 will continue to be present in 2020. The supply cycle, we find ourselves in, will continue to dampen performance, but it is moderating and will reverse. But even while in the depths of this cycle, we are in an incredible business, marked by high occupancies, increasing customer demand, longer average lengths of stay used by all age demographics, no real disruptor on the horizon and an increasing advantage of the large operators over the mom-and-pops. The stable and increasing cash flows we have all enjoyed continue to be a hallmark of self-storage. We are committed to leveraging our experience, our technological sophistication and our diversified portfolio to continue to provide solid returns in 2020 and in the decade ahead of us. 
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott."

Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance",451,"Thanks, Joe, and hello, everyone. Our core FFO for the year was $4.88 per share, ahead of the high end of our guidance. The beat was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and income taxes. During the fourth quarter, rental and tenant insurance revenue were in line with expectations. Revenue growth was primarily driven by achieved rate growth and higher occupancy with lower discount usage also providing a benefit. Same-store expenses were elevated due to increases in property tax, marketing expense and payroll. We continue to be pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our access to all types of capital. After obtaining our BBB credit rating from S&P, we now qualify for improved pricing on our credit facility that will lower interest expense going forward. 
Last night, we provided guidance and annual assumptions for 2020. Our new same-store pool will increase by 42 stores for a total of 863 stores. We expect the change in the same-store pool to benefit our revenue growth by only 10 basis points or less over the year. We experienced gradual moderation in our same-store revenue growth through the end of 2019 due to new supply and expect that moderation to continue into 2020. Same-store revenue growth is expected to increase 0.75% to 1.75%. 2020 same-store expense growth is expected to increase 4% to 5%. We do not expect as much pressure from property taxes and marketing expenses in 2020, but we do expect them to continue to be outsized. 
The projected increases in property taxes are heavily weighted to Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas. In addition, we anticipate higher payroll expense due to a difficult 2019 comp. Our revenue and expense guidance results in same-store NOI growth expectations of negative 0.5% on the low end of the range to a positive 1% on the high end. For 2020, we expect to invest $230 million in acquisitions, approximately $55 million of which is closed or under contract. We also expect to invest an additional $60 million in bridge loans. Our guidance assumes external growth will be financed with net operating income and debt. As always, we are committed to being disciplined, but we will be opportunistic and innovative in seeking additional ways to grow externally. We have plenty of liquidity and capacity and will proactively pursue accretive growth opportunities as they become available. 
Our full year core FFO is estimated to be $4.99 to $5.08 per share. In 2020, we anticipate $0.07 of dilution from value-add acquisitions and an additional $0.13 of dilution from C of O stores for total dilution of $0.20, down $0.03 from 2019 levels. 
With that, let's now turn it over to Latif to start our question-and-answer session."

So we've been discussing revenue growth moderation and a soft landing for several years now. And we experienced a decline, this moderation in revenue growth in 2019, but it was somewhat delayed from our initial guidance. It was somewhat later in the year.

I think it's important that we be clear about what marketing spend is. Marketing spend is akin to an investment. When we choose to spend marketing dollars, we're doing so because we can track a positive ROI on that dollars. And marketing spend is less than 3% of revenue for us. So it doesn't have a giant impact when you have a high-margin business and you can generate rentals by that spend. That being said, our 2020 budgets do have a moderate increase in marketing spend. We will see and feel a greater impact of that increase, excuse me, in the first quarter due to a bad comp with first quarter 2019. But we do have a moderate impact over the life of the year. And frankly, if we end up spending more than our budgets say we do, it's because we chose to spend that money and we believe it's going to have and we know it's going to have a good return."

But it's pretty similar to what we've done throughout the entire year. The quarter looked a little different because it's when we lapped our current discounting policy with how we did things last year. So discounting had less of a benefit in the fourth quarter than it had for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our discounting trend in 2020 is assumed to be very similar to what we did in 2019. If you look at rates in 2019, you probably need to start at the first of the year. At the first of the year, we had low to mid-single-digit rate growth and our occupancy fell. So by mid-year, we were about 50 basis points below year-over-year in our occupancy. And we made a decision to be a little bit more aggressive not only in marketing spend but also in our -- on our rate. So starting with July 4, we ran a special where we dropped rates 7% or 8% during the month of July and primarily related with that special is when we started doing that, and we tell you it worked. The additional marketing spend and the lower rates in July caused occupancy to jump. We then pushed rates up throughout the remainder of the year and finished the year close to flat. So we were slightly negative on our achieved rates, but our occupancy grew by about 140 basis points from the end of June through the end of the year. So that combination of increased marketing spend and lower rates caused occupancy to grow. And towards the end of the year as we push rates back up to closer to flat, we continued to maintain that occupancy and actually expanded it a little bit."

And we're entering into this year with $54 million, $55 million worth of deals in the pipeline. So we have less -- kind of less in the bag that we know is going to come about. A lot of that is due to we significantly slowed down our commitments to CO deals and developments several years ago. So there's much fewer of those delivering now. And that turned out to be a good decision. I'm happy we don't have more new product being delivered into today's market. On the acquisition side, we see very few, least stable, good properties, good markets on the market. There's just very few of those. Most of what we see in the market are stores that are in some stage of lease-up, and we price those and bid on them. But our view of the lease-up and the future returns on those is less than the market. And frankly, we're not very competitive. And we don't rely on being an active purchaser of broker deals in 2020, just like we weren't in 2019 and prior years. So that means we're going to have to get creative, and we're going to have to try to talk to a lot of people in the market and see what their needs are and find the capital voids and see how we can use our advantages and try to create deals that produce accretive long-term value for our shareholders. And I can't tell you what that is, just like I couldn't tell you in the beginning of 2019 that we were going to do a preferred equity investment, whether our bridge loan program was going to be so successful or that, I guess, we were talking to W.P.

Thank you, everyone, for your participation today and interest in Extra Space Storage. We certainly understand everyone's concern over declining revenue growth and the impact of new supply in the market. However, I think it's important to step back and look at some big picture items. Even in the toughest part of the development cycle, we project to deliver over 4% core FFO growth, which, given where we are, I would say, is not a bad result. We can do so because we have many tools, including innovative ways to grow to support this FFO growth, and we'll continue to explore and execute smart innovative strategies with good risk-adjusted returns. Even with all this new supply delivered, we are at an extremely high occupancy, and this is a direct result of our ability to acquire customers. Our machine works. We have positive same-store revenue growth, even though 2/3 of our property have had new supply delivered in their markets. We have an improved, rated, flexible balance sheet and access to multiple sources of debt and equity capital that will allow us to take advantage of opportunities presented in the market. And we've been disciplined in the acquisition market. We're not stretching to get deals. We're not buying things just to grow. We're remaining very disciplined.

Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response, I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly, our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis, it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees, regardless of role or region of the country, have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe. And all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up extra space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead, this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding extra spaces values.
With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March, property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations, and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of guidance. We continue to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity.
External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk-reward metrics.
Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners, and we are very comfortable that we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities and as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment.
We are proud of our strong start to the year. And while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic, such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases, and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders, create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes, some of which fall outside of our initial guidance.
What we considered simply revising our annual guidance range, we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance, one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions, is the timing of lifting stay at home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio, multiple California markets where rental activity is improving. But the uncertainty of when other major markets like New York City, will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year.
Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market, we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point and time metrics, we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product while temporarily slowed will continue. The life transitions that have made man so durable in the past will continue.
The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever, and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail."

To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy delta to 90 basis points, while also increasing achieved rates. By early March, our achieved rates were flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March, stay-at-home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country, the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly.
Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April, partially offset by vacates, which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down, it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic, which is expected. Web traffic remains steady, indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30 was 91.1%, which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year, but still very healthy.
To give you some context, occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis, and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue.
In April, achieved rates for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases, which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders, we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April. And this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same-store pool due to increased accounts receivable and pausing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls for aggressively following up with past due accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May, and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline.
As Joe mentioned, while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19, our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate.
With that, let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A."

If you look at the first quarter and look at which expense line items were elevated, the ones that pop-out to your payroll, marketing and then property taxes. I think property taxes are pretty close to what we were expecting, and we expect them to be somewhat elevated. But as if revenues fall, then you potentially get some reprieve, but that typically lags by as much as a year or 2.
In terms of payroll, part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year, we actually had negative 4% payroll growth, and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more an inflationary, call it, 3% to 4%, but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open.
The last one is really marketing and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated, partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year. And it was elevated throughout the year, and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year, and we expect to continue to use marketing this year, but I don't think you'll see the elevated spend quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year."

So I think that's really the difficult question, and one of the reasons we pulled guidance is, one is the occupancy in the summer as well as how long are we on pause in terms of our existing customer rate increases. In terms of historically, how has it added? It actually has added between 10 and 30 basis points to our annual growth rate. It's not a significant driver because we do it on a year-over-year basis. Now where it could hurt you this year, for instance, is if we have to pause these for months on end. Now if this pause happens for a month or 2, it obviously impacts us, but it's much less than if we pause them for 5 or 6 months. And so that's obviously one of the big reasons why we hoped not to update our guidance and pull our guidance."

And I know part of that is just an operating side of things, and all of it was a greater adoption to. But there is an element from a same-store NOI perspective, just trying to frame how negative it can be, right?

Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that ever",823,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.
Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that every one of us has had our daily routines interrupted, stress put on our lives and may have dealt with the illness of family and friends. I sympathize with the difficulties everyone has endured and greatly appreciate the professionalism, positive attitude and support shown by everyone on this call. If times of crisis reveal our true nature, then our industry can be very proud of itself. I hope you and your loved ones are well, healthy and managing through this.
Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response, I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly, our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis, it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees, regardless of role or region of the country, have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe. And all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up Extra Space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead, this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding Extra Space's values.
With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March, property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations, and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of guidance. We continue to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity. External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk-reward metrics.
Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners, and we are very comfortable that we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment.
We are proud of our strong start to the year. And while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic, such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases, and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders, create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes, some of which fall outside of our initial guidance.
What we considered simply revising our annual guidance range, we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance, one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions is the timing of lifting stay-at-home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio, multiple California markets where rental activity is improving. But the uncertainty of when other major markets, like New York City, will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year.
Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market, we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point-in-time metrics, we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product, while temporarily slowed, will continue. The life transitions that have made demand so durable in the past will continue.
The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever, and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail."
8057672,663010484,1976336,"Extra Space Storage Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Extra Space Storage Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-ove",447,"Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy delta to 90 basis points, while also increasing achieved rates. By early March, our achieved rates were flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March, stay-at-home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country, the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly.
Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April, partially offset by vacates, which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down, it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic, which is expected. Web traffic remains steady, indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30 was 91.1%, which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year, but still very healthy.
To give you some context, occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis, and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue.
In April, achieved rates for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases, which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders, we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April. And this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same-store pool due to increased accounts receivable and pausing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls or aggressively following up with past due accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May, and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline.
As Joe mentioned, while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19, our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate.
With that, let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A."

If you look at the first quarter and look at which expense line items were elevated, the ones that pop-out to your payroll, marketing and then property taxes.

If you look at the first quarter and look at which expense line items were elevated, the ones that pop-out to your payroll, marketing and then property taxes. I think property taxes are pretty close to what we were expecting, and we expect them to be somewhat elevated. But as -- if revenues fall, then you potentially get some reprieve, but that typically lags by as much as a year or 2.
In terms of payroll, part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year, we actually had negative 4% payroll growth, and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more at inflationary, call it, 3% to 4%, but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open.
The last one is really marketing, and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated, partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year. And it was elevated throughout the year, and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year, and we expect to continue to use marketing this year, but I don't think you'll see the elevated spend quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year."

And so our decision to do this was very customer-focused and recognizing that they're feeling some strain as they're staying at home, as you've had -- people sick around them, a lot of fear and so our decision was to move away from auctions to pause those and then also to move away from collection calls. We did do some reminder calls, letting people know. But starting the first part of May as things open up, we are moving back to auction. So as states open up, following the state mandates, we will open up auctions if it's allowed.
We will try to work first to pay to vacate a unit. So we'll try to work with the customer to take -- get whatever we can to have them vacate versus moving to auction. It's a better experience. And we will now begin more of a collection call versus a collection reminder or a payment reminder where you are calling now instead of saying your rent is due, we're saying your rent is due and do you have a credit card?

Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that ever",823,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.
Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that every one of us has had our daily routines interrupted, stress put on our lives and may have dealt with the illness of family and friends. I sympathize with the difficulties everyone has endured and greatly appreciate the professionalism, positive attitude and support shown by everyone on this call. If times of crisis reveal our true nature, then our industry can be very proud of itself. I hope you and your loved ones are well, healthy and managing through this.
Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response, I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly, our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis, it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees, regardless of role or region of the country, have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe. And all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up Extra Space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead, this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding Extra Space's values.
With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March, property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations, and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of guidance. We continued to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity. External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk-reward metrics.
Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners, and we are very comfortable that we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment.
We are proud of our strong start to the year. And while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic, such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases, and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders, create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes, some of which fall outside of our initial guidance.
While we considered simply revising our annual guidance range, we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance, one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions is the timing of lifting stay-at-home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio, multiple California markets where rental activity is improving. But the uncertainty of when other major markets like New York City will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets, reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year.
Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market, we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point-in-time metrics, we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product, while temporarily slowed, will continue. The life transitions that have made demand so durable in the past will continue.
The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever, and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail."

To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-ove",447,"Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy delta to 90 basis points, while also increasing achieved rates. By early March, our achieved rates were flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March, stay-at-home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country, the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly.
Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April, partially offset by vacates, which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down, it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic, which is expected. Web traffic remains steady, indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30 was 91.1%, which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year, but still very healthy.
To give you some context, occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis, and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue.
In April, achieved rates for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases, which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders, we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April. And this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same-store pool due to increased accounts receivable and pausing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls or aggressively following up with past due accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May, and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline.
As Joe mentioned, while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19, our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate.
With that, let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A."

If you look at the first quarter and look at which expense line items were elevated, the ones that pop-out here are payroll, marketing and then property taxes. I think property taxes are pretty close to what we were expecting, and we expect them to be somewhat elevated. But as -- if revenues fall, then you potentially get some reprieve, but that typically lags by as much as a year or 2.
In terms of payroll, part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year, we actually had negative 4% payroll growth, and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more at inflationary, call it, 3% to 4%, but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open.
The last one is really marketing, and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated, partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year. And it was elevated throughout the year, and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year, and we expect to continue to use marketing this year, but I don't think you'll see the elevated spend quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year."

The whole industry is now in that low 90s. And I know part of that is just an operating side of things, and all of it was a greater adoption to.

Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that ever",823,"Thank you, Jeff. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for your interest in Extra Space.
Before I discuss the first quarter and the balance of 2020, I would like to make a couple of introductory remarks. First, I understand that every one of us has had our daily routines interrupted, stress put on our lives and may have dealt with the illness of family and friends. I sympathize with the difficulties everyone has endured and greatly appreciate the professionalism, positive attitude and support shown by everyone on this call. If times of crisis reveal our true nature, then our industry can be very proud of itself. I hope you and your loved ones are well, healthy and managing through this.
Secondly, I'm frequently asked what makes Extra Space different or special. In response, I describe our portfolio, our operating and technology platforms and most importantly, our people. While all of these have performed well during this crisis, it is our people, particularly our store managers, who have really stepped up and delivered in an extraordinary manner. All of our employees, regardless of role or region of the country, have adapted quickly to changing operating procedures and requirements and have gone to great efforts to keep our stores open and our customers safe. And all of this was done while they were under the same personal stress and worry that we all are feeling. I could not be prouder of the people who make up Extra Space and feel extremely lucky to be part of such a great team. I know that whatever challenges lie ahead, this team will strive to optimize performance while upholding Extra Space's values.
With respect to performance, Q1 was a strong quarter. Even with the impact of COVID-19 in the latter part of March, property revenue for the quarter was in line with expectations, and same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Core FFO per share growth was 6.9%, $0.04 higher than the top end of guidance. We continued to see strong external growth through third-party management with 48 stores added to the platform and in bridge loan activity. External growth through acquisitions is currently muted as we patiently wait for opportunities that present attractive risk-reward metrics.
Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have been in contact with all of our lenders and partners, and we are very comfortable that we have sufficient capital options to satisfy upcoming maturities as well as having additional capacity to be opportunistic if attractive investments become available in this unusual environment.
We are proud of our strong start to the year. And while we are fortunate that we have been able to keep our stores open, execute new leases and continue to provide our customers access to their belongings, we certainly have not been immune to the impacts of COVID-19. The financial impact of the changes to our operations caused by the pandemic, such as the decision to pause auctions, temporarily suspend existing customer rent increases, and a reduction in rental activity due to stay-at-home orders, create a wide range of possible FFO outcomes, some of which fall outside of our initial guidance.
While we considered simply revising our annual guidance range, we recognized that in order to provide accurate guidance, one key driver impacting all primary revenue assumptions is the timing of lifting stay-at-home orders across the country and subsequent customer behavior. We are encouraged by the activity we see in markets like Detroit, Salt Lake City and most impactful to our portfolio, multiple California markets where rental activity is improving. But the uncertainty of when other major markets like New York City will reopen and how customers will respond in such dense urban markets, reduces our performance visibility for the balance of the year.
Therefore, since these key factors remain unclear and will vary from market to market, we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance that would reasonably capture the full span of possibilities. It would also encourage us to produce guidance that may be overly cautious in order to include even remote possibilities. However, we believe it is important to be transparent with the information that we have to help our investors understand our company and the sector so they can make informed decisions. As we provide point-in-time metrics, we urge you not to lose sight of the big picture. It is still a very good time to be invested in storage. Demand for our need-based product, while temporarily slowed, will continue. The life transitions that have made demand so durable in the past will continue.
The advantages over smaller operators with our diversified portfolio, sophisticated platform and top-notch team are still in place. Our balance sheet quality is better than ever, and external growth opportunities will likely increase going forward.
I would now like to turn the time over to Scott to walk through some of those metrics in more detail."
8057672,663010484,2010389,"Extra Space Storage Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","Extra Space Storage Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-ove",447,"Thank you, Joe, and hello, everyone. To understand our current operating trends, it is helpful to have some context as to what has taken place over the last few months. From January of this year until early March, we further expanded our positive year-over-year occupancy delta to 90 basis points, while also increasing achieved rates. By early March, our achieved rates were flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. Beginning in mid-March, stay-at-home orders caused a gradual reduction in rental activity. This was partially offset by increased college student rentals. However, as more orders were issued across the country, the reduction in rentals and vacates increased significantly.
Rentals were down 35% to 40% for the 30 days from mid-March to mid-April, partially offset by vacates, which were down approximately 25% during the same period. Over the last 15 days of April, rental velocity improved with 25 of our top 30 markets experiencing an increase in rental velocity compared to the previous 30 days. While rental volume has been down, it is primarily due to lower walk-in traffic, which is expected. Web traffic remains steady, indicating that people are still looking for storage. Occupancy as of April 30 was 91.1%, which is 60 basis points lower than this time last year, but still very healthy.
To give you some context, occupancy at the end of the first quarter in 2008 was 84.1%. Our ability to acquire customers is significantly better today than leading up to the financial crisis, and we believe we'll be able to continue to drive traffic to our properties and to maximize revenue.
In April, achieved rates for new rentals were down approximately 10% year-over-year. In March, we postponed sending existing customer rate increases, which is having an adverse impact on our revenue growth. As municipalities lift stay-at-home orders, we are resuming rate increases market by market. We collected 93% of rent in April. And this is down approximately 5% on a year-over-year basis for the same-store pool due to increased accounts receivable and pausing auctions. It is important to note that these levels were attained without making collection calls or aggressively following up with past due accounts from mid-March until the end of April. We have resumed these practices in May, and we expect accounts receivable balances to decline.
As Joe mentioned, while we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19, our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution, and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate.
With that, let's turn it over to Daniel to start our Q&A."

If you look at the first quarter and look at which expense line items were elevated, the ones that pop-out here are payroll, marketing and then property taxes. I think property taxes are pretty close to what we were expecting, and we expect them to be somewhat elevated. But as -- if revenues fall, then you potentially get some reprieve, but that typically lags by as much as a year or 2.
In terms of payroll, part of the reason it is elevated in Q1 this year is it's a tough comp. Q1 last year, we actually had negative 4% payroll growth, and so very difficult comp. We would expect payroll to continue to be elevated more at inflationary, call it, 3% to 4%, but not necessarily at that 7% range. We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open.
The last one is really marketing, and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated, partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year. And it was elevated throughout the year, and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year, and we expect to continue to use marketing this year, but I don't think you'll see the elevated spend quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year."

So as states open up, following the state mandates, we will open up auctions if it's allowed.
We will try to work first to pay to vacate a unit. So we'll try to work with the customer to take -- get whatever we can to have them vacate versus moving to auction. It's a better experience.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and extra space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees who have continued to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling that allows us to optimize our performance. 
All this good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crisis does not create character but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial and justice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color. And I am proud that recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent has been a focus of our company for many years and is not a new initiative. 
However, the tragic events of the last 2 months reinforced to me that while Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values. And I'm committed that our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. 
Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all-time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry-specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. 
While our occupancy is at an all-time high, until recently, we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represent approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result, at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from nonpaying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states. But due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak leasing season for retenanting these units. 
Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacates. I do not personally believe that the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume, and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy when we may not have a full set of tools available to optimize returns due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe that pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects in planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is suppressing rate growth. 
So while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have, and we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders' long-term value. 
I'd now like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned."

All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective. And as demand started to pick up through the quarter, our rentals rebounded, improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. And as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from nonpaying customers. In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful. 
Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels. However, due to delayed auctions in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels. And we have recognized the loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors, together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May, will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue, and we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. 
Property level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self-storage space. We have closed $52 million in bridge loans year-to-date, with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital-light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving nonsame-store income. 
We also -- we are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we'll act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted average debt maturity. 
As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage, and our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. 
With that, let's turn it over to Orin to start our Q&A."

You really don't know what their occupancy rate expenses are until they want to sell it, and you can take a look at their financials. In general, when we see smaller operators either because they want us to take over management of their stores or because they're putting their store for sale, we can do better than they can. It's just as simple as that. We can run the stores better, we can fill them up more and we can get higher rates. And I don't think that has changed at all because of COVID.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and Extra Space.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and Extra Space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees who have continued to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling that allows us to optimize our performance. 
All this good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crisis does not create character but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial injustice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color. And I am proud that recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent has been a focus of our company for many years and is not a new initiative. 
However, the tragic events of the last 2 months reinforced to me that while Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values. And I'm committed that our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. 
Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all-time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry-specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. 
While our occupancy is at an all-time high, until recently, we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represent approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result, at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from nonpaying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states. But due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak-leasing season for retenanting these units. 
Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacates. I do not personally believe that the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume, and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy when we may not have our full set of tools available to optimize returns due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe that pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects in planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is suppressing rate growth.
So while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have. And we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders' long-term value. 
I'd now like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned."

All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective. And as demand started to pick up through the quarter, our rentals rebounded, improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. And as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from nonpaying customers. 
In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful.
Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels. However, due to the delayed -- due to delayed auctions in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels. And we have recognized the loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors, together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May, will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue. And we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. 
Property-level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self-storage space. We have closed $52 million in bridge loans year-to-date, with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital-light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving nonsame-store income. 
We also -- we are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we'll act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted average debt maturity. 
As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage, and our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. 
With that, let's turn it over to Oren to start our Q&A."

So the example I would give you is pre-COVID, I think most people enjoyed working with a manager, liked their managers. They were very successful in leasing units. Since this has happened, we've gone to a touchless process where our managers are involved via telephone. And we have expanded that even further where they can do a complete rental online at 3:00 a.m. with no manager involvement. And that's at, I believe, about 1,200 of our stores as of today.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and Extra Space.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and Extra Space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees who have continued to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling that allows us to optimize our performance. 
All this good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crisis does not create character but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial injustice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color. And I am proud that recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent has been a focus of our company for many years and is not a new initiative. 
However, the tragic events of the last 2 months reinforced to me that while Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values. And I'm committed that our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. 
Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all-time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry-specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. 
While our occupancy is at an all-time high, until recently, we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represent approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result, at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from nonpaying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states. But due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak-leasing season for retenanting these units. 
Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacates. I do not personally believe that the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume, and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy when we may not have our full set of tools available to optimize returns due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe that pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects in planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is suppressing rate growth.
So while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have. And we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders' long-term value. 
I'd now like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned."

All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective. And as demand started to pick up through the quarter, our rentals rebounded, improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. And as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from nonpaying customers. 
In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful.
Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels. However, due to the delayed -- due to delayed auctions in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels. And we have recognized the loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors, together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May, will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue. And we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. 
Property-level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self-storage space. We have closed $52 million in bridge loans year-to-date, with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital-light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving nonsame-store income. 
We also -- we are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we'll act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted average debt maturity. 
As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage, and our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. 
With that, let's turn it over to Oren to start our Q&A."

One thing that I will tell you that a company like Extra Space that has a large portfolio has an advantage is we don't have to guess too much of things. So as we were going -- as we were faced with many of these new situations, we very quickly tried different things in a test basis in several hundred stores and learned what worked and what didn't. So we didn't have to make kind of final decisions for the whole portfolio. And that was very beneficial because we were faced with new customer situation, new customer behavior.

Now that sounds great, if you don't put that in context. And the context I would give you is, one, July was an easy comp. Last year, we actually dropped rates in July to increase our occupancy. And then 2, we've seen a shift in channel in July, where we've seen more tenants coming -- walking in and renting an effective through our highest channel. It's our highest-priced channel.

The second quarter presented unique challenges to our country, our industry and Extra Space. I am incredibly thankful to our employees who have continued to operate our stores, service our customers, grow our company, strengthen our balance sheet and to do all the day-to-day blocking and tackling that allows us to optimize our performance. 
All this good work was done in unusual and sometimes difficult working situations and often with added personal and family stress and uncertainty. It is said that crisis does not create character but reveals character. And I could not be prouder of the character the Extra Space team has shown during these past several months. This quarter also presented a stark reminder of racial injustice in our country. Approximately 40% of our teammates are black or other people of color. And I am proud that recruiting, developing and retaining diverse talent has been a focus of our company for many years and is not a new initiative. 
However, the tragic events of the last 2 months reinforced to me that while Extra Space is a values-driven company with a great inclusive culture, we can do better. In response, we have enhanced our existing diversity and inclusion initiatives and have taken several concrete steps to improve as a company. These steps are consistent with our company values. And I'm committed that our response will not be limited to making statements or temporary steps, but we'll be continuing and substantive. 
Turning to our performance in the second quarter. Most importantly, we were able to grow FFO in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. We have started to see several positive trends on which Scott will provide further detail. Our platform is able to find and capture high-value customers. Rentals have normalized and vacates remain muted. As a result, our occupancy is at an all-time high and prices have begun to move in the right direction. Where we can, we have resumed more normal pricing, operational practices and auctions. However, these positive trends should not obscure the macro and industry-specific risks we still face. There are still uncertainties with respect to the course and length of the virus, its economic impact and its effect on consumers and their willingness to pay for storage. 
While our occupancy is at an all-time high, until recently, we have not been allowed to initiate the auction process in several markets, which represent approximately 47% of our same-store NOI. As a result, at the end of June, approximately 150 basis points of our occupancy is from nonpaying tenants due to delays in auction. By the end of July, this inflated occupancy increased to approximately 200 basis points. We are now moving forward with auctions in most states. But due to notice periods, actual auctions in several states won't begin until September, which will be outside of the peak-leasing season for retenanting these units. 
Occupancy has also benefited from lower-than-normal vacates. I do not personally believe that the moderation in vacates represents a permanent behavioral shift of our customers. Instead, at some point, more historically normal activity will resume, and we will see vacates increase, putting further pressure on occupancy when we may not have our full set of tools available to optimize returns due to government state emergency orders or regulations. Also the non-COVID headwinds that we had coming into 2020 are still present. While we believe that pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects in planning, properties are still being delivered, and there is still excess inventory leasing up in many markets, which is suppressing rate growth.
So while we are encouraged by recent results, there are enough remaining uncertainties and risks that we are not in a position to reinstate guidance. The possible outcomes remain too broad for guidance to be meaningful, depending on how the risks I've outlined play out. We will continue to be transparent on all metrics and answer questions that you may have. And we will continue to work hard every day and remain laser-focused on maximizing shareholders' long-term value. 
I'd now like to wish Scott a happy birthday and turn the time over him to walk through some of the metrics that I mentioned."

All of our properties are open and have been fully operating since May. We modified our stores by adding plexiglass partitions stantions to direct the flow of traffic and sanitation stations to provide a safer experience for our customers and our employees. These updates have been effective. And as demand started to pick up through the quarter, our rentals rebounded, improving from a negative 35% year-over-year delta in April to a positive 4% rental growth rate in June. Vacates for the quarter were approximately 17% lower year-over-year, resulting in strong occupancy growth, which went from a negative 60 basis point year-over-year gap at the end of April to a positive 100 basis point gap at the end of the quarter. At the end of July, this has expanded to 150 basis points. However, this increased occupancy came at a price. Our average achieved rate for the quarter was down approximately 17%. And as Joe mentioned, our quarter end occupancy was inflated by 150 basis points from nonpaying customers. 
In May, we restarted our collection efforts, which have been successful.
Accounts receivable less than 60 days have dropped back to historical levels. However, due to the delayed -- due to delayed auctions in key states such as California, New Jersey and New York, we are still working accounts receivable greater than 60 days through the system. Today, accounts receivable greater than 60 days as a percentage of rental income are running approximately 325 basis points higher than historical levels. And we have recognized the loss on aged accounts receivable based on estimated collections. All of these factors, together with temporarily pausing existing customer rate increases in March, April and May, will continue to drag on revenue growth in the back half of the year. 
While street rates and rental activity have improved significantly, it will take time for the impact of May and June's lower achieved rates to flow through to revenue. And we do not anticipate positive same-store revenue growth in the second half of the year. While we are being proactive with controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, we will continue to have expense pressure from payroll, property taxes and marketing expense. 
Property-level performance will continue to be challenged in the back half of the year, but we are finding success in other parts of the business and have strengthened our balance sheet. We continue to find ways to grow externally and to accretively deploy capital in the self-storage space. We have closed $52 million in bridge loans year-to-date, with another $170 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. In July, we purchased a $103 million senior mezzanine note at a discount with an anticipated yield to maturity of 6.1%. Our third-party management platform provides capital-light growth, providing management fees and tenant insurance driving nonsame-store income. 
We also -- we are also vigilantly pursuing acquisition opportunities, and we'll act swiftly when we identify transactions that we believe add value to our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with the addition of a new $300 million revolving credit facility and the closing of a $425 million private placement transaction during the quarter. Funds from the private placement transaction will be taken through delayed draw to pay off our convertible notes and will increase our weighted average debt maturity. 
As Joe mentioned, we haven't been immune to the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our business. That said, it is good to be in storage, and our company is well positioned to navigate the current landscape. Our team has a track record of consistent, high level execution and we will continue to find ways to provide value to our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. 
With that, let's turn it over to Oren to start our Q&A."

I trust everyone and their families remain healthy and are managing through this difficult time. 
2020 has been a challenging and eventful year, an unprecedented conditions related to the pandemic have made it difficult to forecast performance. On our last call, we discussed the tailwinds we are experiencing in terms of rental activity, muted vacates, positive achieved rate trends and the resumption of normal operations. We also discussed the potential headwinds that we believe we could face, including economic and political risk as well as changing customer behavior and new supply. 
During the third quarter and to date, the tailwinds have proved stronger than we expected, while the headwinds have not been as significant or have not materialized. 
Rental volume remains healthy, while vacate volume remains muted, resulting in all-time high occupancy of approximately 96%. Through July, occupancy was inflated with nonpaying customers due to the inability to auction delinquent units. However, as the quarter continued and auctions resumed, we have been able to maintain our high occupancy and collections have returned to historically normal levels. 
Our elevated occupancy resulted in the return of pricing power during the third quarter. In short, our stores are performing significantly better than we expected earlier in the pandemic. 
On the last call, we stated that we expected to have negative same-store revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the continuation of the tailwinds we are experiencing, we have achieved positive revenue growth in October and are confident we will produce positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter. 
We remain mindful of the potential macro and industry-specific uncertainties that we have referenced during the third quarter. However, at present, these risks do not appear to be negatively impacting the demand for storage or consumers' ability and willingness to pay for our product. The primary headwind impacting performance is new supply in certain markets. While the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered and excess inventory is still leasing up, which will continue to suppress rate growth in high supply markets. 
Despite the improving trends, our same-store NOI remained negative in the third quarter. However, even with the disruption COVID-19 caused to our operations, we continue to grow core FFO per share, which is our ultimate goal. In the third quarter, FFO per share increased 5.6%, and FFO growth for the first 3 quarters was 5%, both sizable beats over consensus. 
Our flexible organizational structure and focus on innovative capital-light strategies have enhanced FFO through new external growth channels and non-same-store income streams. These contributions paired with improving same-store trends lead us to believe that our 2020 FFO will comfortably exceed the high end of our pre-COVID expectations. 
Turning to external growth. Acquisition volume has picked up in the sector as markets have started to settle. But pricing for widely brokered deals, particularly for stabilized properties, remains very competitive. During the quarter, we have closed or put under contract an additional $140 million of acquisitions, bringing our total expected investment in 2020 to $287 million. 
In addition to acquisitions, we continue to find ways to creatively invest capital in the storage sector. Our bridge loan program continues to grow with approximately $315 million in bridge loans scheduled to close in 2020, with the expectation to sell 70% to 80% of the balances. We have also approved $167 million of loans to close in 2021. 
We also purchased $103 million senior mezzanine note at a small discount. And subsequent to quarter end, we invested an additional $50 million in SmartStop through our previously negotiated preferred equity investment. And through 3 quarters, we have added 72 stores net to our third-party management platform. 
In short, we continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value through optimizing property level operations efficiently and creatively investing capital in the storage sector at acceptable risk levels. 
I'll now turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we've seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter.

As Joe mentioned, we've seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter. During September and October, we typically see occupancy and achieved rates start to moderate due to seasonality. This year, this has not been the case. Rentals remained steady while vacates are still down, and October occupancy remained relatively similar to this summer's highs at just under 96%, a positive year-over-year delta of approximately 260 basis points, with less than 20 basis points of inflated occupancy-related to non-paying tenants. 
New customer rates also remain strong. Achieved rates to new customers were flat year-over-year in July and improved to approximately 11% in August, September and October. We have completed the rollout of our online leasing platform, rapid rental and have seen approximately 20% of rentals come through this channel. We have also reinstated existing customer rent increases in most markets with a focus on bringing customers with below market rates closer to current levels. To date, such increases have not caused outsized vacate activity. 
Despite these strong trends, same-store revenue remained negative in the quarter, primarily driven by lower other income due to fewer assessed late fees and auction fees. We've tried to work with our customers and have been lenient where appropriate, given challenges related to the pandemic. 
We have been proactively controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, while ensuring we aren't hurting the long-term value of our properties or our business. Expense growth from property taxes was generally offset by savings in utilities and repairs and maintenance, and we managed to keep payroll generally flat without furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts. 
We continue to view marketing spend as an investment in top line revenue growth, and we'll continue to use this lever to drive revenue when the return warrants it. We've been tracking the results of California's Proposition 15 carefully, and it appears that it will not pass and have an impact on property tax expense. 
We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and have access to many types of capital at attractive pricing. We received $425 million from our previously completed private placement transaction. And subsequent to quarter end, we used these funds, revolver capacity and shares to settle our $500 million convertible notes. 
All in all, 2020 has been an eventful year, and we have certainly seen the landscape shift rapidly over the last 2 quarters. While we can't predict all the future challenges we may face, we believe our flexible organizational structure, our focus on innovation and, ultimately, our people position us to react quickly to change and to capitalize on various opportunities that follow. We operate in a fantastic sector, and our diversified portfolio, advanced platform and talented team will continue to maximize shareholder value regardless of the economic climate. 
With that, let's turn it back over to Jenny to start our Q&A."

A risk of the future is that customer behavior returns to normal, vacates return to normal and that puts pressure on occupancy. However, we don't think there's any way to encourage people to stay in Storage. Storage is a need based product and at some point, people won't need the storage anymore. And at that point, they'll leave. They may not leave immediately because of inertia. But sooner or later, they're going to realize I don't need this anymore. And even if we cut their rent to $1, they don't need it, and. They're going to go and move on and do whatever they need. So we can't encourage people to stay. What we can do is make sure that we can replace those tenants in the most efficient manner at the lowest cost, at the best rate that we can."

The product has to be completed and operating. We manage each of these loans. So in addition to the economics of the loan, we get the economics of the management contract. We look somewhat at the borrowers' financial capacity, particularly because they have obligations -- personal obligations to replenish operating and interest reserves. But our primary collateral is the real estate. We underwrite the real estate, as if we're going to buy it, to the same team that underwrites our acquisitions. And we make loans where we're comfortable. If we have to own the property at our loan balance, then we'll be happy that we did that. 
The second question with regard to pacing, this program has grown, frankly, faster this year than we thought. And we did $100 million in our first year. We will fund or approve for funding probably close to over $500 million this year. And I think the acceleration is because where people are just looking for a way to get to a better tomorrow. We're in this weird position. They just want to get some financing that will let them get their store to a more stabilized number, and then they can put permanent financing or sell or do whatever. 
It's important to remember that we sell 70% to 80% of the balances of the loan. So they're structured as first in mezz or A and B will sell the first position and retain the second position that both leverages our return and allows us to control the amount of capital that's allocated to this program.

Or is it that you just see more value in the bridge loan program, and that's attracting your capital?"

I trust everyone and their families remain healthy and are managing through this difficult time.
2020 has been a challenging and eventful year, an unprecedented conditions related to the pandemic have made it difficult to forecast performance. On our last call, we discussed the tailwinds we are experiencing in terms of rental activity, muted vacates, positive achieved rate trends and the resumption of normal operations. We also discussed the potential headwinds that we believe we could face, including economic and political risk as well as changing customer behavior and new supply.
During the third quarter and to date, the tailwinds have proved stronger than we expected, while the headwinds have not been as significant or have not materialized.
Rental volume remains healthy, while vacate volume remains muted, resulting in all-time high occupancy of approximately 96%. Through July, occupancy was inflated with nonpaying customers due to the inability to auction delinquent units. However, as the quarter continued and auctions resumed, we have been able to maintain our high occupancy and collections have returned to historically normal levels.
Our elevated occupancy resulted in the return of pricing power during the third quarter. In short, our stores are performing significantly better than we expected earlier in the pandemic.
On the last call, we stated that we expected to have negative same-store revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters. Due to the continuation of the tailwinds we are experiencing, we have achieved positive revenue growth in October and are confident we will produce positive revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
We remain mindful of the potential macro and industry-specific uncertainties that we have referenced during the third quarter. However, at present, these risks do not appear to be negatively impacting the demand for storage or consumers' ability and willingness to pay for our product. The primary headwind impacting performance is new supply in certain markets. While the pandemic has delayed new deliveries and may reduce new projects and planning, properties are still being delivered and excess inventory is still leasing up, which will continue to suppress rate growth in high supply markets.
Despite the improving trends, our same-store NOI remained negative in the third quarter. However, even with the disruption COVID-19 caused to our operations, we continue to grow core FFO per share, which is our ultimate goal. In the third quarter, FFO per share increased 5.6%, and FFO growth for the first 3 quarters was 5%, both sizable beats over consensus.
Our flexible organizational structure and focus on innovative capital-light strategies have enhanced FFO through new external growth channels and non-same-store income streams. These contributions paired with improving same-store trends lead us to believe that our 2020 FFO will comfortably exceed the high end of our pre-COVID expectations.
Turning to external growth. Acquisition volume has picked up in the sector as markets have started to settle. But pricing for widely brokered deals, particularly for stabilized properties, remains very competitive. During the quarter, we have closed or put under contract an additional $140 million of acquisitions, bringing our total expected investment in 2020 to $287 million.
In addition to acquisitions, we continue to find ways to creatively invest capital in the storage sector. Our bridge loan program continues to grow with approximately $315 million in bridge loans scheduled to close in 2020, with the expectation to sell 70% to 80% of the balances. We have also approved $167 million of loans to close in 2021.
We also purchased $103 million senior mezzanine note at a small discount. And subsequent to quarter end, we invested an additional $50 million in SmartStop through our previously negotiated preferred equity investment. And through 3 quarters, we have added 72 stores net to our third-party management platform.
In short, we continue to execute on our strategy to maximize shareholders' long-term value through optimizing property level operations and efficiently and creatively investing capital in the storage sector at acceptable risk levels.
I'll now turn the time over to Scott."

As Joe mentioned, we've seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter.

As Joe mentioned, we've seen a number of positive trends during the quarter that are continuing into the fourth quarter. During September and October, we typically see occupancy and achieved rates start to moderate due to seasonality. This year, this has not been the case. Rentals remained steady while vacates are still down, and October occupancy remained relatively similar to this summer's highs at just under 96%, a positive year-over-year delta of approximately 260 basis points, with less than 20 basis points of inflated occupancy-related to non-paying tenants.
New customer rates also remain strong. Achieved rates to new customers were flat year-over-year in July and improved to approximately 11% in August, September and October. We have completed the rollout of our online leasing platform, Rapid Rental, and have seen approximately 20% of rentals come through this channel. We have also reinstated existing customer rent increases in most markets with a focus on bringing customers with below market rates closer to current levels. To date, such increases have not caused outsized vacate activity.
Despite these strong trends, same-store revenue remained negative in the quarter, primarily driven by lower other income due to fewer assessed late fees and auction fees. We've tried to work with our customers and have been lenient where appropriate, given challenges related to the pandemic.
We have been proactively controlling expenses to offset lower revenue, while ensuring we aren't hurting the long-term value of our properties or our business. Expense growth from property taxes was generally offset by savings in utilities and repairs and maintenance, and we managed to keep payroll generally flat without furloughs, layoffs or pay cuts.
We continue to view marketing spend as an investment in top line revenue growth, and we'll continue to use this lever to drive revenue when the return warrants it. We've been tracking the results of California's Proposition 15 vote carefully, and it appears that it will not pass and have an impact on property tax expense.
We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and have access to many types of capital at attractive pricing. We received $425 million from our previously completed private placement transaction. And subsequent to quarter end, we used these funds, revolver capacity and shares to settle our $500 million convertible notes.
All in all, 2020 has been an eventful year, and we have certainly seen the landscape shift rapidly over the last 2 quarters. While we can't predict all of the future -- while we can't predict all the future challenges we may face, we believe our flexible organizational structure, our focus on innovation and, ultimately, our people position us to react quickly to change and to capitalize on various opportunities that follow. We operate in a fantastic sector, and our diversified portfolio, advanced platform and talented team will continue to maximize shareholder value regardless of the economic climate.
With that, let's turn it back over to Jenny to start our Q&A."

But one of the factors -- a strong factor in our very high occupancy is that vacates are muted. And I agree with you. A risk of the future is that customer behavior returns to normal, vacates return to normal and that puts pressure on occupancy. However, we don't think there's any way to encourage people to stay in storage. Storage is a need-based product and at some point, people won't need the storage anymore. And at that point, they'll leave. They may not leave immediately because of inertia. But sooner or later, they're going to realize I don't need this anymore. And even if we cut their rent to $1, they don't need it and they're going to go and move on and do whatever they need. So we can't encourage people to stay. What we can do is make sure that we can replace those tenants in the most efficient manner at the lowest cost, at the best rate that we can."

The product has to be complete and operating. We manage each of these loans. So in addition to the economics of the loan, we get the economics of the management contract. We look somewhat at the borrowers' financial capacity, particularly because they have obligations -- personal obligations to replenish operating and interest reserves. But our primary collateral is the real estate. We underwrite this real estate, as if we're going to buy it, to the same team that underwrites our acquisitions. And we make loans where we're comfortable. If we have to own the property at our loan balance, then we'll be happy that we did that.
The second question with regard to pacing, this program has grown, frankly, faster this year than we thought. And we did $100 million in our first year. We will fund or approve for funding probably close to over $500 million this year. And I think the acceleration is because where people are just looking for a way to get to a better tomorrow. We're in this weird position. They just want to get some financing that will let them get their store to a more stabilized number, and then they can put permanent financing or sell or do whatever.
It's important to remember that we sell 70% to 80% of the balances of the loan. So they're structured as first in mezz or A and B, will sell the first position and retain the second position that both leverages our return and allows us to control the amount of capital that's allocated to this program.

So at the end of the day, we're not seeking to buy the most, we're seeking to make the most money."

Just going back to the demand question and the customer behavior, just asking in a different way. Just thematically, when you're doing the analysis and you're looking at the customer behavior, is there anything that stands out to sort of explain sort of the demand drivers, whether it's be college students or small businesses, work-from-home demand or people leaving a city, just thematically, is there anything to call out there? And the corollary to that would be, as we think about a normalization scenario, what is onetime versus what's going to recur as well as what are we thinking about when things normalize that could actually be a demand positive?"

One is, the demand for storage is driven by life events, at least, on the non-business side. And those life events occurred during a pandemic. Some of those life events occurred during a pandemic and not during a pandemic, right? People are getting divorced there. People are dying, moving to folks -- to old folks' home, all the stuff that gives rice to storage demand before the pandemic is still happening. In addition, you have unique things like college students not going back to college, restaurants having to store half their tables and chairs, people leaving the city to work from home, people leaving the city to move back with their parents because they don't want to be in the city. And that stuff -- some of that stuff may eventually go back to normal. Some of it may be more permanent in nature, and we don't know the mix of that. But we do know that we live in a dynamic country where there's economic movement where there's movement of people and that will continue. And people will continue to use storage based on that. And our customer acquisition platform will continue to reach out and acquire those customers."

And then not to beat the dead horse on external growth, but just thinking about it sort of a different way in terms of just the run rate, I think you said earlier about, obviously, you could buy more deals if you wanted to. But clearly, the focus is about making money. But 6 months ago, when COVID hit, I think we were all trying to get their arms around it. Clearly, the sector has done that really well. Should we just expect a level run rate activity acquisitions to increase simply because maybe there's a little bit more confidence, a little bit more visibility? Could we get back to $200 million, $300 million, maybe even more in acquisitions, assuming those opportunities are out there and they -- and again, they sort of meet your return requirements? How should we think about that?"
