Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, and we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. 
I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. 
We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies. 
Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern, and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our individual life business and higher-than-typical expenses in our international businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. 
We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our international businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. businesses benefited from record account values in retirement and individual annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and other related revenues. Our international businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability Board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year. 
In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook."

I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutio",797,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our group insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. 
As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth and retirement, group insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our individual annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. 
Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and international businesses. 
Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and has grown over the last 3 years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion. For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our international businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year-ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. 
Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from the voluntary separation program. 
As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020 leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."

There's really 2 major impacts that we're seeing in the annuities business. One, as you pointed out, is the outflow. That really is coming from -- we are being very disciplined in our pricing of product and then our return on new sales. And if you look backward, we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect."

I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity business is very profitable, and that is evident by the higher ROE that's in the high teens. And that high ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again, due to our robust risk management."

Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from guaranteed universal life, which obviously is highly interest-rate-sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates.

A very positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform. As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million. And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the platform. I will tell you that we're already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. So it's a completely rectifiable situation and we're well out in front of it."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, and we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. 
I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. 
We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies.
Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern, and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business and higher-than-typical expenses in our International Businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. 
We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our International Businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products.
Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and Individual Annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and Other Related Revenues. Our International Businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year. 
In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook."

I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutio",797,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. Businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. 
As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. Businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth in Retirement, Group Insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our Individual Annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. 
Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and International Businesses. 
Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year-ago quarter and has grown over the last 3 years as we balanced business reinvestment with margin expansion. 
For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.
Turning to Slide 7. Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year-ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. 
Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from the voluntary separation program. 
As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020, leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."

That really is coming from -- we are being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales. And if you look backward, we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect."

I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity business is very profitable, and that is evident by the higher ROE that's in the high teens. And that high ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again, due to our robust risk management."

Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from Guaranteed Universal Life, which obviously is highly interest-rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates.

We just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of things that we're excited about. We're, as we sit here today, even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business. In fourth quarter, we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers. And just to define that for you, we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that's willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That's compared against $3.5 million in the year-ago quarter. So we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform. 
As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million. And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the platform. I will tell you that we're already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. So it's a completely rectifiable situation and we're well out in front of it."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. 
I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. 
We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies.
Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern, and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business and higher-than-typical expenses in our International Businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. 
We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our International Businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products.
Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and Individual Annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and Other Related Revenues. Our International Businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year. 
In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook."

I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutio",801,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. Businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. 
As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. Businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth in Retirement, Group Insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our Individual Annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. 
Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and International Businesses. 
Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last 3 years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion. 
For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.
Turning to Slide 7. Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. 
Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from the voluntary separation program. 
As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020, leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."

And if you look backward, we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect."

I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity business is very profitable, and that is evident by the high ROE that's in the high teens. And that high ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again, due to our robust risk management."

As far as you referenced the assumption updates, we're seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter. 
Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from Guaranteed Universal Life, which obviously is highly interest-rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates. So pleased with what we're seeing. The success is really coming from we have a very, very strong brand name. We believe our product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top-notch."

We just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of things that we're excited about. We're, as we sit here today, even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business. In fourth quarter, we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers. And just to define that for you, we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that's willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That's compared against $3.5 million in the year ago quarter. So we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform. 
As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million. And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the platform. I will tell you that we're already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. So it's a completely rectifiable situation and we're well out in front of it."

We have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our current clients but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. 
I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. 
We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies.
Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern, and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business and higher-than-typical expenses in our International Businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. 
We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our International Businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products.
Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and Individual Annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and Other Related Revenues. Our International Businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year. 
In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook."

I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutio",801,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. Businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. 
As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. Businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth in Retirement, Group Insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our Individual Annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. 
Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and International Businesses. 
Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last 3 years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion. 
For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.
Turning to Slide 7. Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. 
Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from the voluntary separation program. 
As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020, leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."

And if you look backward, we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect."

I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity business is very profitable, and that is evident by the high ROE that's in the high teens. And that high ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again, due to our robust risk management."

This year, a little bit better than that. And this should -- we then distribute in both the forms of dividends and share repurchases. Our dividends have increased actually 12 years in a row now. And if you look at the average increase over the last 5 years, it's been 11%. And now that dividend represents, as I mentioned in my opening comments, a 4.4% yield on book value. Our Board has also authorized $2 billion of share repurchases for 2020. So generally, a very consistent approach to our shareholder distributions, which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share repurchases."

As far as you referenced the assumption updates, we're seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter. 
Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from Guaranteed Universal Life, which obviously is highly interest-rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates. So pleased with what we're seeing. The success is really coming from we have a very, very strong brand name.

We just closed the acquisition in October, but I'll tell you, there's a lot of things that we're excited about. We're, as we sit here today, even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business. In fourth quarter, we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers. And just to define that for you, we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that's willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That's compared against $3.5 million in the year ago quarter. So we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform. 
As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million. And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the platform. I will tell you that we're already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4Q of 2020. So it's a completely rectifiable situation and we're well out in front of it."

Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.33. We also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12.1% for the full year. Looking back on 2019, we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term. As a result, we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives, against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance. 
I'll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019. First, we launched a process, talent and technology transformation initiative, which is on track to realize $500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022. As part of this program, we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our U.S. workforce during the fourth quarter, which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce. Second, we returned approximately $4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The 10% increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on book value in excess of 4%. Third, we completed our acquisition of Assurance IQ in October, adding a leading direct-to-consumer financial wellness solutions platform. 
We're encouraged by the growth in customer demand, the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well-known technology companies.
Finally, we made progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern, and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance. In 2019, our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment, the annual assumption update in our Individual Life business and higher-than-typical expenses in our International Businesses. In 2020, we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead. 
We're focused on executing 3 key initiatives. First, we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long-term sustainable growth while generating $140 million in cost savings this year. Second, in our International Businesses, we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets. Supporting this objective, this quarter, we closed on the acquisition of a Colombian pension fund manager with Habitat, expanding our presence in Latin America. We also completed the sale of our Italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets, including Korea. We'll share further details at the appropriate time. And third, we're continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment, such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products.
Turning to Slide 3. I'll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results, which Rob will cover in more detail. Our U.S. Businesses benefited from record account values in Retirement and Individual Annuities. Earnings increased from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business. PGIM, our global asset manager, reported record assets under management of $1.3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and Other Related Revenues. Our International Businesses increased earnings, driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth, partly offset by higher-than-typical expenses. 
Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to touch briefly on 4 ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way. First, we are a purpose-driven company. We strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders. Second, in December, our Board introduced a multi-stakeholder framework that extends the Board's accountability to investors, employees, customers and society at large, reinforcing the Board's commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns. Third, this multi-stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental, social and governance practices. Finally, we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress. We disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board's task force on climate-related financial disclosures. This includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and water usage. In addition, we publish metrics in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
We continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold. Just last month, Fortune included us on its list of World's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. We are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year. 
In closing, we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place, including the 3 initiatives I have outlined for 2020. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook."

I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutio",801,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses and in our near-term earnings growth outlook. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. Businesses have 3 key priorities for growth. First, we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins. Second, we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities, including, by way of example, the non-jumbo corporate segment of the full-service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our Group Insurance business. And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market, including through workplace financial wellness and Assurance IQ. 
As a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities, over time, we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns. In the near term, we expect underlying earnings in the U.S. Businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth in Retirement, Group Insurance and Assurance IQ offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our Individual Annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline. We have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business. 
Now turning to Slide 6. PGIM, our asset management business, continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model, global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value-added strategies that serve investors globally. With a record $1.3 trillion of assets under management as of year-end, PGIM is a top 10 global asset manager. It is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms. We continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets. And as the investment engine of Prudential, PGIM benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our U.S. and International Businesses. 
Our investment performance is a key driver of our business success. More than 80% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. This performance helped us to generate $1.9 billion of net third-party flows during the fourth quarter, including $1.2 billion of institutional and $700 million of retail net flows. In addition, PGIM rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018. PGIM's adjusted operating margin of 32% in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last 3 years as we balance business reinvestment with margin expansion. 
For the full year 2019, PGIM had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4% higher than 2018 and 6% higher after adjusting for business acquisition-related costs. Looking ahead, we believe PGIM is well positioned to deliver mid- to high single-digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager, and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the Wells Fargo fee arrangement that ended last year.
Turning to Slide 7. Our International Businesses continue to benefit from our world-class Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high-growth markets. Life Planner sales increased by 17% compared to the year ago quarter. This increase was driven by record Life Planner count and higher sales in Brazil, Korea and Taiwan. Sales for Gibraltar were 14% lower than the year ago quarter. This primarily reflects lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in U.S. interest rates led us to lower crediting rates. In addition, we continue to focus on quality distribution. The number of life planners as a result has declined. The lower Life Consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales. We continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability. 
Total in force for international increased by 3% from the prior year, including a 5% increase in Life Planner and a 1% increase in Gibraltar. In the near term, we expect total in force to grow at a similar level. We expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I'll begin on Slide 8, which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results. We begin with pretax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.33 on an after-tax basis, then we adjust for the following items. First, in the fourth quarter, we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income, which was a benefit of $135 million. Second, the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $435 million or $0.85 per share and is comprised of 2 items. The fourth quarter included $160 million of seasonally higher expenses and $365 million of implementation costs, including the impact from the voluntary separation program. 
As indicated in the 8-K filing on December 17, we expect implementation costs of $175 million in 2020 with about $20 million of these costs in the first quarter, and long-term compensation expense for retiring eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted, which is typically in the first quarter of each year. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect this expense to be about $70 million split between PGIM and corporate and other. These items net to $0.85 per share. Third, there are other considerations that we expect will have a $20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our -- to the fourth quarter. And fourth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $10 million, assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter. Combined, this gets us to a baseline of $2.95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases, business growth and market impacts in 2020. The baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces EPS by approximately $0.15 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
I'd also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix. On Slide 18, we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll-forward by business. And on Slide 19, we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business. In addition, we have included some other considerations for 2020 on Slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs, the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate. 
Now turning to Slide 9. I'll provide an update on capital deployment, liquidity and leverage. We feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position. We returned $900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases, which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses. On December 19, we announced the Board's authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock in 2020. In addition, we increased the first quarter dividend to $1.10 per share, which represents a 10% increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4.4% yield on our adjusted book value. We also continue to maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our AA financial strength targets, and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our $3 billion to $5 billion liquidity target range. We will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses, assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders.
Turning to Slide 10, and in summary, we had numerous accomplishments in 2019. We are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020, leading to greater earnings in 2021. Now I'll turn it to the operator for your questions."

There's really 2 major impacts that we're seeing in the annuities business. One, as you pointed out, is the outflow. That really is coming from -- we are being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales. And if you look backward, we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range. So that's creating that outflow. And the other thing I would point to, though, is as that business is rolling across its surrender period, we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect."

I'd just add -- I know there's been some questions about the ROA. Our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high ROE, and our variable annuity business is very profitable, and that is evident by the high ROE that's in the high teens. And that high ROE reflects our unique product design, our robust risk management and disciplined pricing. And our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings, capital and cash flow even with significant market moves. So as a result, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values. And the ROA may move as market moves, but again, our earnings, capital and cash flow will be stable and ROA is simply an outcome. So the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets, while it had an increase in account values, had a less meaningful impact on our earnings, again, due to our robust risk management."

And if you look at the average increase over the last 5 years, it's been 11%. And now that dividend represents, as I mentioned in my opening comments, a 4.4% yield on book value.

Shifting over to the new business sales, we are very, very pleased with the performance of sales in the Individual Life business, as you cited, it's best quarter in 5 years. We're probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales. The mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from Guaranteed Universal Life, which obviously is highly interest-rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life, which has much, much less sensitivity to interest rates. So pleased with what we're seeing. The success is really coming from we have a very, very strong brand name.

We're, as we sit here today, even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business. In fourth quarter, we saw very, very strong consumer demand flow across the platform. We saw 6.5 million shoppers. And just to define that for you, we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that's willing to share their contact information with us. So we saw 6.5 million shoppers across the platform in 4Q. That's compared against 3.5 million in the year ago quarter. So we're very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand. A very positive for us on that is we have product providers, literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform. So from a revenue potential perspective, we're every bit as strong as we were. We are in -- kind of where we're focused right now is getting those additional products onto the platform. 
As far as your numbers around revenue, yes, our revenue for the year came in just north of $300 million. And really, what I would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents, we'll call it, capacity on the platform. We learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the Medicare Advantage and under 65 health care agents onto the platform.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front",1058,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. 
At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19 while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth while dealing with short-term business realities. 
Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. 
First, turning to Slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees now working remotely. I'm pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. 
Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,095 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA event and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. 
Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential to navigate the current environment. We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the global markets, we executed our playbook. 
We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions prefunded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. While it seems like a light time ago, I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pretax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by noneconomic factors. Our U.S. and international business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by lower other related revenues. 
While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter."
1038328,646130680,1973587,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets,",1788,"Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and international businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and Kaha earnings in our international business by $30 million. 
Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our individual life business. We have strong life insurance marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 million or $0.58 a share. 
Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual Solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. Our U.S. businesses continue to execute on 3 key priorities. First and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19 related claims with expanded e capabilities for proof of death. Just the weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continue to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education. We're also making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. 
As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions to distribution from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for individual life. 
In our retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. 
Now turning to Slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions even as we work in a virtual environment. While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our 3-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 5 years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance and our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third-party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. 
Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Public fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows. And of note, PGIM was the highest ranking U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues declined primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well positioned vis-à-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our international businesses include our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. Life planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. 
In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower-than-expected operating income. As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. 
We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 result in heightened interest in Protection products. Particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of international business sales. 
Now turning to our investment portfolio on Slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio construction and management, reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. 
With respect to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. Our commercial mortgage loans are well protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4x. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. Quality of our portfolio as demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, we our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. 
Slide 23 in the appendix provides more detail on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. 
Turning to Slide 11. To help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a 3- year recession cycle. We provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3- year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1 year of our free cash flow. Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pretax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: first, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a 1 quarter lag in the second quarter. Second -- next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter this includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. Next, we included a placeholder for potential COVID-19 related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. 
And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduced EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on Slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. The as part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business in our mortality businesses. 
Although the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. 
After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses in 2020, we estimate these costs will be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. In addition, we have substantial sources of funding our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. The and another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks and a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with JPY 100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. 
Turning to Slide 15 and in summary, we are committed to fulfilling our purpose to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position, and we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives.

These are based on an estimate of 100,000 guests in the U.S. and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now we'll have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured population versus the general population. We certainly have taken in consideration higher fatality rates for the older population. And then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with -- tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York. California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. 
And then your second question was around the expenses. We've we looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees for crisis Care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly in international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated that is the appropriate thing to do given the situation. We will -- we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back to sort of rebound. But I would estimate if we're going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens"

On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 million earlier in the year and $500 million towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March, we were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will  take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. 
In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. 
In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP and statin economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that are mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP."

So we were -- had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to note that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the -- when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process -- I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. 
I'd also note that the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our -- the 10-year treasury under the next 7 years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we typically would and that will be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our significant change in our GAAP sensitivity and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter."

We also believe and have seen evidence that we'll see an uptick in short-term disability incidents. So that will serve to compress margins throughout this year. We see a couple of other impacts I just mentioned from a sales and flows perspective. Most of our book of business is medium and large size employers. So actually, most of our sales for 2020 are already baked in that business. And any slowdown we're seeing is more of a 2021 impact. I guess the last thing I'd mention is a lot of the impacts that group insurance will feel. We actually are mitigated against from the perspective that we're not in the under 100 live segment business. So we don't have exposure to the small segment employers.

And we actually saw a reduction year-over-year in our expenses on business. So we like the progress we're seeing there. 
The second lever is leaning into and growing the business with profitable business that we're putting on the books. And as I mentioned, our sales are up year-over-year. And we are comfortable with the pricing and the profitability of the business that we're selling. 
As far as the third lever, and it's the lever that you referenced, it really is looking at the ability to reinsure the block of business.

And if and when we take action on that, we will report out on it, but nothing to report as we sit here today."

Let me handle that one. The -- we haven't received forbearance request. The vast majority of that, as you would expect, is coming from the hotel and mall tenants having said that, to date, through April in any event, we've had -- we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that, by and large, almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization, the loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that, that will build over time to some greater amount. But having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% and based on our internal appraisals. What we find is if we actually use external appraisals, that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principle, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our property, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality well located properties. 
So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis as it has been, in fact, through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly, those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. 
At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19 while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth while dealing with short-term business realities. 
Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. 
First, turning to Slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees now working remotely. I'm pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. 
Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,095 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. 
In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA event and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. 
Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. 
In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential's -- to navigate the current environment. 
We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the global markets, we executed our playbook. 
We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions prefunded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. 
During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. Well it seems like a life time ago. I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pretax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. 
The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by noneconomic factors. Our U.S. and International Business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by  lower other related revenues. 
While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter."
1038328,646130680,1974241,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets,",1864,"Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and International Businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and [ Kihei ] earnings in our International Business by $30 million. 
Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our Individual Life business. We have strong life insurance marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. 
In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 or $0.58 a share. 
Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. 
With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. 
Our U.S. Businesses continue to execute on 3 key priorities: first and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19-related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. In just a weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continued to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering Pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients and we introduced a new solution to help customers manage debt and partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market-sensitive solutions, to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our Individual Annuities business we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year, the launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. 
In our Individual Life business we're also  making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions to distribution from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for Individual Life. 
In our Retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. 
Now turning to Slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. 
Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions, even as we work in a virtual environment. 
While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our 3-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 5 years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance and our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third-party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. 
Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Public fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows. And of note, PGIM was the highest ranking U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues declined primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well positioned vis-à-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life Planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales, following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. 
Life Planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. 
In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. 
Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower-than-expected operating income. As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. 
We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in protection products. Particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. 
With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return on expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed, as we move forward. 
Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of International Business sales. 
Now turning to our investment portfolio on Slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio of construction and management, reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. 
Back to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements, with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. 
In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to single A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. 
Our commercial mortgage loans are well protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4x. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. 
Quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. 
From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. 
Slide 23 in the appendix provides more details on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. 
Turning to Slide 11. To help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a 3- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments, defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. 
Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3-year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1-year of our free cash flow. 
Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results.

I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: first, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a 1 quarter lag in the second quarter. Second -- next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential of Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting in the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. 
Next, we included a placeholder for Prudential potential COVID-19-related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. 
And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduce EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on Slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business and our mortality businesses. 
Although the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. 
After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs will be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. 
In addition, we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business. Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. 
In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks and a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with JPY 100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. 
Turning to Slide 15 and in summary. We are committed to fulfilling our purpose, to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with robust capital and liquidity position. And we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives.

First, I want -- like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 tests in the U.S., and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now what we have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is, we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured population versus the general population. We certainly have take into consideration higher fatality rates for the older population. And then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with -- that tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. 
In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. 
And then your second question was around the expenses. We've looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees, for crisis Care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly, in our international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated, that is the appropriate thing to do, given the situation. We will -- we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back, perhaps, you know they sort of rebound. But I would estimate if we're going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens of millions. But that's not included in the estimate."

On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as, we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 million earlier in the year and $500 million towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March, we were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. 
In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. 
In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP and stat in economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. 
The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that are mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. Treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned, just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP."

Last year, given the decline in rates, we increased our asset adequacy testing reserve by about $500 million. Now we had derivatives that offset that. So we were with a gain. So we were -- had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to know that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the -- when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. 
From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process -- I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. 
I'd also note that the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is, we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our -- the 10-year treasury under the next 7 years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we would typically would and that'll be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our -- significant change in our GAAP sensitivity and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter."

We see a couple of other impacts I just mentioned from a sales and flows perspective. Most of our book of business is medium and large size employer. So actually, most of our sales for 2020 are already baked in that business. And any slowdown we're seeing is more of a 2021 impact. I guess the last thing I'd mention is, a lot of the impacts that Group Insurance will feel, we actually are mitigated against from the perspective that we're not in the under 100 Life segment business.

The second lever was -- is leaning into and growing the business with profitable business that we're putting on the books. And as I mentioned, our sales are up year-over-year. And we are comfortable with the pricing and the profitability of the business that we're selling.

The vast majority of that actually would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants. Having said that, to date, through April in any event, we've had -- we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that, by and large, almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization. The loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that will build over time to some greater amount. But having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% based on our internal appraisals. And what we find is, if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principal, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans, given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our properties, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality, well located properties. 
So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis, as it has been, in fact, through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front l",1059,"Thank you, Darin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly, those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. 
At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19 while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth while dealing with short-term business realities. 
Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. 
First, turning to Slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees now working remotely. I'm pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. 
Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,095 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. 
In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA events and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. 
Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. 
In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential's -- to navigate the current environment. 
We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the global markets, we executed our playbook. 
We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions prefunded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. 
During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. While it seems like a life time ago. I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pretax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. 
The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by noneconomic factors. Our U.S. and International Business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by  lower other related revenues. 
While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter."
1038328,646130680,1998439,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets,",1863,"Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and International Businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and [ Kihei ] earnings in our International Business by $30 million. 
Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our Individual Life business. We have strong life insurance marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. 
In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 or $0.58 a share. 
Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. 
With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. 
Our U.S. Businesses continue to execute on 3 key priorities: first and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19-related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. In just a weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continued to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering Pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients and we introduced a new solution to help customers manage debt and partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market-sensitive solutions, to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our Individual Annuities business we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year, the launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. 
In our Individual Life business we're also  making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions to distribution from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for Individual Life. 
In our Retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. 
Now turning to Slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. 
Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions, even as we work in a virtual environment. 
While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our 3-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 5 years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance in our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third-party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. 
Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Public fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows. And of note, PGIM was the highest ranking U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. Other related revenues declined primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well positioned vis-à-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life Planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales, following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. 
Life Planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. 
In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. 
Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower-than-expected operating income. As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. 
We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in protection products. Particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. 
With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed, as we move forward. 
Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of International Business sales. 
Now turning to our investment portfolio on Slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio of construction and management, reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. 
Back to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements, with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. 
In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to single A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. 
Our commercial mortgage loans are well protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4x. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. 
Quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. 
From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. 
Slide 23 in the appendix provides more details on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. 
Turning to Slide 11. To help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a 3- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments, defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. 
Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3-year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1-year of our free cash flow. 
Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646130680,1998439,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results.

I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: first, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a 1 quarter lag in the second quarter. Second -- next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential of Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting in the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. 
Next, we included a placeholder for Prudential potential COVID-19-related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. 
And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduce EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on Slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business and our mortality businesses. 
Although the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. 
After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs may be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. 
In addition, we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business. Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. 
In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks in a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with JPY 100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. 
Turning to Slide 15 and in summary. We are committed to fulfilling our purpose, to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with robust capital and liquidity position. And we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives.

I'll take your questions. On the COVID estimates. First, I want -- like to recognize that these are placeholders.

First, I want -- like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 deaths in the U.S., and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now, well we have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. What we do then is, we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured population versus the general population. We certainly have taken into consideration higher fatality rates for the older population. And then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with -- that tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. 
In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. 
And then your second question was around the expenses. We've looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees, for crisis Care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly, in our international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated, that is the appropriate thing to do, given the situation. We will -- we haven't included in that estimate, potential offsets for the fact that travel and conferences and entertainment will be lower. We would expect if things return at some point to normal that some of that might come back, perhaps, you know they sort of rebound. But I would estimate if we're going to have savings here in the next quarter or so that you can think of that in the tens of millions. But that's not included in the estimate."

On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as, we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 billion earlier in the year and $500 billion towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March, we were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. 
In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. 
In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP and stat in economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. 
The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that are mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. Treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned, just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP."

And the -- we have had sensitivity to our stat financials, primarily around asset adequate testing. Last year, given the decline in rates, we increased our asset adequacy testing reserve by about $500 million. Now we had derivatives that offset that. So we were with a gain. So we were -- had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to know that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the -- when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. 
From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process -- I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. 
I'd also note that the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is, we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our -- the 10-year treasury under the next 7 years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we would typically would and that'll be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our -- significant change in our GAAP sensitivity and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter."

The vast majority of that as you would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants. Having said that, to date, through April in any event, we've had -- we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that, by and large, almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization. The loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that will build over time to some greater amount. But having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% based on our internal appraisals. And what we find is, if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principal, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans, given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our properties, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality, well located properties. 
So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis, as it has been, in fact, through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now.

But looking forward, like some of the strategies that you have in PGIM, whether it's real estate or private credit or some of the specialty products, they're likely to see lower activities. So how should we think about the other related revenue would trend for the balance of the year?"

In first quarter, the predominant impact in other related revenue was from our strategic investing portfolio. That's where we have our seed strategies as well as where we co-invest alongside of our clients. The predominant impact was in from credit spread widening on the fixed income portion of that portfolio. 
In general, if you look back, we tend to have somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $60 million coming from our ORR. We do think it is reasonable as you kind of look forward over the next couple of quarters. Obviously, we think flows will be lumpier in general, and then we do believe that there'll be some slowdown in client activity and then transactions. So there may be some near-term pressure on that. But over the long run, you could think of that in the $50 million to $60 million range."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start this morning by recognizing the extraordinary circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic and by expressing our gratitude to all of those on the front lines who are fighting this crisis around the world. For those individuals and their families directly affected by the pandemic and particularly, those who have lost loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathies. 
At Prudential, we're guided by our purpose: to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. And that includes being there for our employees, our customers and our communities, especially in times like these. We are completely focused on ensuring that we take the right course of action for the business, mitigating the impact of COVID-19 while investing for the future in order to emerge from this crisis stronger than before. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to manage our business for the long-term growth while dealing with short-term business realities. 
Before we get into the first quarter performance, I'll cover some of the key steps we have taken as a company to support our employees, customers and communities in response to COVID-19. 
First, turning to Slide 3. Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and their families is our top priority. As the pandemic emerged, we initiated new policies and actions to ensure their safety and security, including additional family care support. This included implementing a wide-scale remote work environment, with approximately 98% of our employees and most of our international employees now working remotely. I'm pleased to report that all our businesses and operational functions continue to run smoothly. 
Prioritizing the well-being of our employees enables us to address the evolving health and financial needs of our customers as the pandemic and its economic impact reverberate more broadly. We've also provided customers with assistance, such as premium deferrals and fee waivers as well as enhanced digital tools. I'm also incredibly proud of the work our employees have done to support our local communities, including in Newark, El Paso, Hartford and multiple international locations. These efforts include the donation of more than 150,000 face masks, including 75,095 respirators for health care workers in New Jersey. 
In addition, the American Nurses Association and Prudential recently entered into an agreement for Prudential to sponsor ANA events and outreach initiatives in 2020. This agreement will include offering Prudential's financial wellness services and solutions to ANA members and the broader nursing community. We're pleased to be of assistance to those serving on the front lines of this pandemic. 
Turning to our financial strength. On Slide 4, our rock-solid balance sheet provides the foundation for our employees to serve our customers and our communities. We're confident in our ability to successfully manage in this environment in large part due to the robust operational and financial risk framework that we put into place after the Great recession of 2008. This framework prepared us with a playbook to address multiple stress scenarios, including pandemics and economic conditions that are more severe than what we are currently experiencing. 
In addition, we benefit from our recurring revenue model and mix of complementary businesses, which offset risk and produce capital benefits, giving us confidence about Prudential's -- to navigate the current environment. 
We began 2020 with a strong capital and liquidity position, and our capital ended the quarter exceeding AA financial strength levels. As the pandemic unfolded and in light of uncertainty in the global markets, we executed our playbook. 
We successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior debt in early March, while spreads were still attractive. This included a $500 million green bond issuance, the first of its kind for a U.S. company in our sector. These actions prefunded our opportunities through the end of 2021 and enhance the liquidity of our businesses. As part of the playbook, we further enhanced liquidity of our businesses and also paused share repurchases at the end of the first quarter to see how the economic environment develops. 
During the quarter, our variable annuity hedging performed extremely well with a 99% effective rate. Our approach to hedging the economic risk resulted in significant gains on our equity market and interest rate hedges to offset the increased liability. We feel comfortable about our ability to manage equity market fluctuations and continued low interest rates over time. We're also highly confident about the quality of our investment portfolio, which Rob will cover in more detail shortly. The strength of our financial position means our dividends to shareholders remain well covered by our income and free cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are on track to accomplish our strategic initiatives for the year and, in fact, are accelerating their execution in some cases. First, we are repricing our products more quickly and pivoting towards lower risk and less capital-intensive products. Second, with respect to rotating our international earnings mix to higher-growth markets, in April, we reached an agreement to sell our Prudential of Korea business. We also continue to pursue strategic alternatives for our Taiwan business. 
Finally, we continue to make progress on achieving our goal of $500 million in cost savings, $140 million of which should be achieved this year. We realized $30 million in the first quarter through actions we completed before the start of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. While it seems like a life time ago. I'd like to spend a moment on our first quarter performance. We reported pretax adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion or $2.32 per share. 
The GAAP net loss was $0.70 per share, driven largely by noneconomic factors. Our U.S. and International Business earned lower variable investment income in the quarter. We also generated lower underwriting income in our U.S. businesses. Higher asset management fees at PGIM were offset by lower other related revenues. 
While the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic impact remains unknown, we are confident about the strength of our company. Prudential has survived pandemics, wars, recessions and the depression, among other events in its 145-year history. We are resilient, we are strong and we will continue to move forward to deliver sustainable value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a detailed look at our business performance for the quarter."
1038328,646130680,2000113,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets,",1863,"Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, the results from our businesses in the first quarter were negatively impacted by 2 significant factors that we had not anticipated: adverse mortality and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. Adverse market conditions resulted in $150 million of lower variable investment income in our U.S. and International Businesses and also reduced other related revenues in PGIM by $55 million, and the Chilean and [ Kihei ] earnings in our International Business by $30 million. 
Overall mortality was $60 million above our seasonal expectation. We are continuing to work toward improving the profitability of our Individual Life business. We have strong life insurance marketing and distribution capabilities, which we've expanded with the acquisition of Assurance IQ. 
In aggregate, these factors reduced first quarter's adjusted operating income by about $295 or $0.58 a share. 
Lower interest rates and equity markets also challenged fundamentals across our businesses, and we are actively executing pricing and product actions to shift our business mix to less market-sensitive customer solutions. 
With that in mind, I'll turn now to providing more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses considering current market conditions. I will also provide an overview of our investment portfolio, given the increased focus on the risks associated with the potential near-term credit cycle. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our U.S. Businesses consist of the workplace solutions, individual solutions and Assurance IQ divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees, investment spread and underwriting income. 
Our U.S. Businesses continue to execute on 3 key priorities: first and foremost, the financial strength of these businesses, which continues to be solid despite the impacts of COVID-19 and the broader economic conditions. Continue to take product actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business and maintain profitability. Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are leveraging our ongoing technology transformation and digital capabilities to enhance customer engagement. 
For example, within a matter of days in March, we introduced our fast track automated underwriting process for COVID-19-related claims with expanded e-capabilities for proof of death. In just a weekend, we introduced new mobile apps and chat bots to help manage a surge in customer calls and inquiries. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures across our businesses. We will continue to invest in transforming our capabilities by accelerating use of technology to deliver a better customer experience and enhance the speed at which we operate. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face. To support our clients in these challenging times, we continued to invest in and expand our range of capabilities to meet their needs. For example, we completely transformed our flagship financial wellness offering Pathways from an on-site to a virtual offering. In a matter of just weeks, we scheduled over 150 live web-based financial education seminars for our clients and we introduced a new solution to help customers manage debt and partnership with GreenPath. We're also shifting our focus to serving expanded addressable market with lower risk and less market-sensitive solutions, to address the changing market conditions. For example, in our Individual Annuities business we're pivoting to less interest rate sensitive products, including accelerating to May of this year, the launch of our FlexGuard indexed annuity. 
In our Individual Life business we're also making product and pricing changes that will result in the continued pivot to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. As a result of pricing actions, product pivots and the disruptions to distribution from COVID-19, we expect sales to continue to decline for individual annuities in the near term, and we also expect reduced sales for Individual Life. 
In our Retirement business, while the longevity reinsurance market remains active, we expect that current market conditions will impact the funding levels of pension plans and, therefore, result in lower pension risk transfer transactions. 
Now turning to Slide 8. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager with $1.3 trillion of assets under management and continues to leverage its diversified multi-manager model to serve investors. 
Our robust infrastructure and investments in technology have allowed employees to seamlessly transition to working from home. This operational flexibility has allowed us to support clients with portfolio information and insights and address their questions, even as we work in a virtual environment. 
While significant market fluctuations in the month of March affected our 3-year performance, PGIM's long-term track record remains strong. 79% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 5 years and 94% over the last 10 years, and we have seen some recovery of performance in our short-term track record in April. Despite clients temporarily rebalancing into cash, we generated $2.9 billion of net third-party flows during the first quarter. This reflects the resiliency of PGIM's diversified platform across asset classes, regions and client segments. 
Net flows included $4.2 billion of institutional inflows, partially offset by $1.3 billion of retail outflows. Public fixed income experienced both retail and institutional inflows. And of note, PGIM was the highest ranking U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net sales in the quarter. PGIM's asset management fees were up 8% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in average assets under management and a stable fee rate. 
Other related revenues declined primarily due to the effect of mark-to-market losses from credit spread widening in the first quarter. We expect near-term sales across the industry to be impacted by volatile public market conditions, reduced transaction volume in private asset classes and a slowdown in client activity. Despite this, we expect PGIM to emerge well positioned vis-à-vis our competitors, driven by its diversified global platform. 
Turning to Slide 9. Our International Businesses include our Japanese Life Insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Life Planner sales decreased 5% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by lower corporate product sales, following the Japan tax law change, partially offset by replacement U.S. dollar protection products. 
Life Planner headcount, however, reached a record level, increasing 5% compared to a year ago. Sales for Gibraltar were also 5% lower, primarily reflecting the continued trend of lower single-pay U.S. dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels. 
In addition, as we continue to focus on quality distribution, the number of life consultants has declined. In Chile, we are the leading pension provider via our joint venture with Habitat. We earn fees on assets and realized mark-to-market gains or losses on the capital that we are required to invest in the funds. 
Our investment performance has outperformed over time as well as in the fourth quarter -- in the first quarter. Returns in the quarter, however, were down across the industry, and that contributed to approximately $30 million of lower-than-expected operating income. As we look to the second quarter, we expect international sales to decrease significantly, reflecting the effect of social distancing protocols that limit in-person engagement with customers across our distribution channels. This will also affect recruiting of new life planners and life consultants. 
We're actively taking measures, including appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution during this difficult time. Over the longer term, we believe COVID-19 may result in heightened interest in protection products. Particularly the death protection products throughout the core of our needs-based selling approach. 
With respect to the current interest rate environment, we have successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you've seen in the past, we adjust to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed, as we move forward. 
Also, as Charlie stated, in April, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Prudential of Korea. This business represented less than 10% of International Business sales. 
Now turning to our investment portfolio on Slide 10. We have a conservative, quality focused approach to our investment portfolio of construction and management, reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. 
Back to our investment portfolio, here are a few key points. We have a high allocation to government securities, which is primarily comprised of U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds. About half of our BBB and below rated corporate securities are private placements, with financial covenants and structural protections that have consistently resulted in lower losses than comparable public securities. 
In past cycles, the loss experience of our BBB private placements has been comparable to single A public credits or about half the losses of similarly rated BBB public credits. 
Our commercial mortgage loans are well protected with a loan-to-value on the entire portfolio of 56% and debt service coverages in excess of 2.4x. We are overweight in more defensive sectors, such as industrial and multifamily and underweight in both office and retail. We also have a low exposure in our investment portfolio to currently more vulnerable sectors like energy, retail and other at-risk corporates. 
Quality of our portfolio is demonstrated by its performance during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, where our credit loss experience compared favorably to peers. Since then, we have decreased our exposure to structured securities and BBB corporates and increased our holdings of government bonds and single A and above rated corporates. 
From 2008 through the first quarter of 2020, our annual fixed maturity credit losses averaged just 13 basis points of our portfolio. 
Slide 23 in the appendix provides more details on our investment portfolio to exposures currently in focus. While we expect credit losses to emerge, the main takeaway is that we feel comfortable that our exposure is quite manageable and that we are well capitalized to absorb such losses. 
Turning to Slide 11. To help you assess potential credit losses on our investment portfolio over a 3- year recession cycle, we provide a framework using publicly available rating agency and other third-party data for the underlying assumptions. This framework provides potential impairments, defaults and ratings migration. The output suggests impact to PICA's RBC ratio and the solvency margin ratios in Japan would be very manageable and consistent with our expectations. 
Credit losses on an after-tax basis would total approximately $2.4 billion over a 3-year period. To put that into perspective, that will be less than 1-year of our free cash flow. 
Also, if we used experiences from the prior recession in 2008 as the underlying assumptions for this framework, the after-tax credit losses will be much smaller at about $1.6 billion. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646130680,2000113,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results.

I will begin on Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the second quarter of 2020 relative to our first quarter results. We began with pre-tax adjusted operating income in the first quarter, which was $1.2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $2.32 on an after-tax basis. Then we adjust for the following items: first, we expect variable investment income in the second quarter to be $150 million lower than in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by lower returns from private equity investments resulting from the decline in values in the first quarter, reported on a 1 quarter lag in the second quarter. Second -- next, in the second quarter, we will have lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher implementation costs, which will result in a net benefit of $50 million. 
Third, there are other items that combined may be $45 million more favorable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. This includes the normalization of PGIM's other related revenues in our Chilean joint venture income, which were lower in the first quarter due to the mark-to-market of assets for equity markets and credit spreads. This normalization is partially offset by classifying our Prudential of Korea business as a divested business. Fourth, we expect fees to be lower on a run rate basis in the second quarter. This reflects account values starting in the second quarter at a lower point than the average level in the first quarter. 
Next, we included a placeholder for Prudential potential COVID-19-related claims and expenses totaling $250 million. I will provide additional details of these items on the next slide. 
And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields on our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $792 million of operating earnings and $1.53 per share for the second quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the second quarter that reduce EPS by approximately $1.22 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Given the extraordinary circumstances created by COVID-19, on Slide 13, we provide estimates for the potential operating earnings impact directly associated with the pandemic in 2020. As part of our risk management process, we model many potential stress scenarios, including a pandemic scenario. We have substantial reserves and highly liquid assets to ensure we are well positioned to readily satisfy all policyholder claims and continue to be well capitalized. We also benefit from the diversification of our businesses, and specifically, the complementary nature of our retirement longevity business and our mortality businesses. 
Although the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we thought it would be helpful to provide estimates for the potential impact on net mortality and costs in 2020. The estimate for the impact on net mortality assumes 100,000 deaths across the total U.S. population and 40,000 deaths across the total population in Japan. 
After considering the profile of our insured policyholders, we estimate the impact on earnings from net mortality may be approximately $200 million in 2020. Also, assuming the spread of COVID-19 is substantially contained in the second quarter, we estimate approximately $135 million of earnings impact may occur in the second quarter with possibly lower impact in the second half of the year. Also, as we continue to support our employees and families during this difficult time, we expect to incur additional costs, primarily related to sales support, employee health protection, technology and other expenses. In 2020, we estimate these costs may be approximately $230 million with $115 million of these costs in the second quarter. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. Our financial leverage ratio is at our target and our regulatory capital levels at our insurance companies remain higher than the targets. 
In addition, we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $5.3 billion at the end of the quarter. As previously highlighted, we expect to receive net proceeds from -- of approximately $1.7 billion from the sale of Prudential of Korea business. Following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2020. And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses, which represents approximately 65% of earnings over time. 
In addition, we have readily available off-balance sheet resources. This includes a $4 billion credit facility with 23 banks in a syndicate structure across the U.S., Europe and Asia. We also have access to $1.5 billion of funding from a contingent capital facility with the right to issue debt in exchange for U.S. treasury securities held by a trust. And we have a bank -- Japan Bank facility with JPY 100 billion available to Prudential Holdings of Japan. 
Turning to Slide 15 and in summary. We are committed to fulfilling our purpose, to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. We maintain a rock-solid balance sheet with robust capital and liquidity position. And we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. 
Now I'll turn it over to the operator for your questions."

I'll take your questions. On the COVID estimates. First, I want -- like to recognize that these are placeholders.

First, I want -- like to recognize that these are placeholders. These are based on an estimate of 100,000 deaths in the U.S., and 40,000 deaths in Japan. Now well we have to see how things play out. And there's likely a range of outcomes around that for the U.S. and Japan. So I just want to recognize that we've done our best to give a placeholder, but it's predicated on a number of assumptions. 
What we do then is, we then make considerations for lower fatality rates for the insured population versus the general population. We certainly have taken into consideration higher fatality rates for the older population. And then we took into consideration the geography of our insured population with -- that tend to have a little bit higher concentration in New Jersey and New York, California and Washington. So when we put that all together, we've applied those to our average profile and provided those estimates. And again, we'll likely have a good range around some of those assumptions. 
In terms of our retirement business, it does provide an offset to some of our life insurance as we've expected and designed. It offsets about 30% of our exposure, and that's just kind of how the modeling plays out. 
And then your second question was around the expenses. We've looked at the steps that we need to take in order to care for our employees, for crisis Care as well as compensation for sales professionals, particularly, in our international locations, if our sales were to decline. And we've estimated, that is the appropriate thing to do, given the situation.

On the $2 billion of debt included the $1.5 billion that we issued at the holdco. You can think of that as, we would ordinarily have issued, say, $500 billion earlier in the year and $500 billion towards the end of the year. But we decided to do $1.5 billion in March, we were worried about how the conditions were developing and thought it would be prudent to do $1.5 billion, which essentially will take care of any maturities in 2020 and 2021. So it's about $1 billion more than we would ordinarily have done perhaps, but we thought it was an appropriate thing to do. 
In terms of why we call it operating debt, right now, those proceeds sit at the holding company in cash. And we follow sort of the way that our rating agencies think about classifications of debt. So -- and the planned proceeds, again, we have it available at the holding company. And it would -- it's used -- it's available for paying off the debt again for this year and next year. 
In terms of the non-AOI item for the quarter, our variable annuity business is very well hedged. And we like to align our outcomes for GAAP and stat in economics. And as Charlie mentioned in his comments, it was highly effective at 99%. 
The way we hedge interest risk, again, which was highly effective in the quarter, is with both derivatives that are mark-to-market and recorded in the P&L, but also by holding a 30-year U.S. treasuries, which had a $1.7 billion gain and would have offset the non-AOI item in the quarter. But the gain on the U.S. Treasuries is recorded to OCI and not to the income statement. So economically, and from a stat standpoint, we were very well aligned, just with a little bit of difference between where our gain is recorded for GAAP."

Last year, given the decline in rates, we increased our asset adequacy testing reserve by about $500 million. Now we had derivatives that offset that. So we were with a gain. So we were -- had a stable RBC outcome. But it's also important to know that sort of at this level of very low interest rates, that the way the testing works is the -- when rates are so low, the shock is much lower. So we'll have less sensitivity to lower rates from this point forward. 
From a GAAP standpoint, our sensitivity really hasn't changed. And as you know, we have a process -- I'll remind people that we have a process where we look at our long-term rate assumption and that includes doing a survey of economist banks and other managers. And we also look at the implied forward curve, and we look to be at the median of all that. And that's the process that we're going through. 
I'd also note that the way our interest rate assumptions work for GAAP is, we start at current rates and we grade to a long-term assumption over 10 years. So as a result, our -- the 10-year treasury under the next 7 years is less than 3%. So we're going through our process as we would typically would and that'll be finalized by our risk management committees in late June. So no change in our -- significant change in our GAAP sensitivity and we'll be doing our usual process in the second quarter."

I think it's too hard to quantify that right now. We'll see how our sales plays out. If we have opportunities to make sales in attractive business, we'll do that. If the conditions are such that, either the returns are attractive or it's too difficult to conduct business that would lower sales and we would see some capital offset for that. So I just don't -- I think it's a little tricky to put a number on that right now."

The vast majority of that as you would expect is coming from the hotel and mall tenants. Having said that, to date, through April in any event, we've had -- we've actually granted forbearance on a little less than 3% of the portfolio. And that, by and large, almost entirely has been just with respect to principal amortization. The loans continue to remain current with regard to interest payments. We do expect that will build over time to some greater amount. 
But having said that, we're actually quite comfortable. If you look at the loan-to-value that we have across the mortgage portfolio, it's at 56% based on our internal appraisals. And what we find is, if we actually use external appraisals that drops to around 46%. So being in a position to be able to provide forbearance on principal, we don't think actually puts at risk our ability to be repaid on those loans, given the relatively low amount of leverage that we have on our properties, and combined with the fact that our mortgage portfolio is very concentrated in higher quality, well located properties. 
So we're feeling quite good about the status of the mortgage portfolio, and we expect it to be resilient through this crisis, as it has been, in fact, through all prior of our recessions. If you look at the 2008 recession and you sort of take that and you roll that forward, we've had sort of a 1 basis point loss ratio on our mortgages from that period until now. So we actually feel pretty good about the way in which we've underwritten it, and we feel very good about the way we're positioned going forward."

Obviously, we think flows will be lumpier in general, and then we do believe that there'll be some slowdown in client activity and then transactions. So there may be some near-term pressure on that. But over the long run, you could think of that in the $50 million to $60 million range."

I'll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of an equity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose, of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. 
After transitioning over 95% of our U.S. employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they've continued to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We'll continue to innovate the sharing and after the pandemic. 
During this a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiative, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. By delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We're also focused on identifying opportunities for further action particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to market. And we're exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our existing 2020 targets. 
Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I'll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. 
Turning now to our 2020 products. We remain on track to achieve our $143 million cost savings target for total years, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continued to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remained on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020, and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix, while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by the progress we're making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we're looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. 
On Slide 5, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives, with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed a AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our U.S. long-term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.25%. 
Lastly, we anticipate receiving the USD 1.7 billion of [indiscernible] business by the end of the year. In terms of capital deployment plans, we'll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. 
Slide 6 shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don't have a one-sided exposure. 
In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the noncash effect of noneconomic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. 
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. 
PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income as well as market appreciation. 
Our International Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth, were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. 
Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to address the recent disturbing incidence of racial injustice and how we, as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on Slide 7. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. 
We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognized that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. 
It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. 
I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we'll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 8. The U.S. businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on 3 key priorities. First, we've implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions, aligned with our intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest rate-sensitive solutions. 
And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. 
Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance, and have increased the use of our fast track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face, and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. Preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we've been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. 
Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter. More than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. 
This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. 
PGIM investments was the #1 ranked U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As expected, Life Planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life Planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Similar to Life Planner, sales for July were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average, and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. 
With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. 
We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted. And over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. 
With respect to interest rates, we've successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. 
We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. Second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sites. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646131042,2060674,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help",874,"On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. 
To help you see this, I'll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. 
Then, we adjust for the following items: first, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the U.S. and come to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. 
Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period to period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our target. We adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects [indiscernible] second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. 
Next, there are other items that, combined, may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs, to be $130 million lower in the third quarter. This is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. 
In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And in [indiscernible] income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. 
Fifth, we expect operating costs, due to COVID-19, to be $25 million lower in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter, that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the U.S. population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our U.S. insurance businesses than previously estimated. 
Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. 
We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our U.S. employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan as their productivity is improving [indiscernible] we expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. 
And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that, combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remained on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We're exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate marketing impacts. And we maintain a rock bound -- rock-solid balance sheet, with a robust capital liquidity position.

I'll take your question about the COVID mentality into the third quarter. So we -- in our second quarter, we benefited from our Longevity business in the U.K. Mortality in the U.K. came in a little bit higher than we had previously estimated, and that resulted in a gain from our U.K. Longevity reinsurance business. 
While there was fatalities in the U.K. in the second quarter, right, wouldn't expect that to continue given the current fatality rates. So we also, in our new estimate, have incorporated into to that sensitivity, what we learned from the second quarter, which is in our -- also in our life insurance and group insurance businesses, the fatality rates were lower than we previously estimated. So we've incorporated that into our new estimate."

I'll take a shot at that. First, let me just bring it up a level and say as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks. 
The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them. And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth, specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps [indiscernible] to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued. So think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business. We'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks. To reinsuring indoor -- looking at selling the blocks. 
A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual products or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduced the retention limits that we have within our individual life business, one way of example. 
Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we have that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. We're also looking at the investment portfolio, and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us. 
And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital like, for instance, peach of our asset manager business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about from a derisking standpoint. 
Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that?"

Thanks, Rob. So Ryan, let me just try and connect some dots.

And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? 
And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products and annuities and ILI. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on the business that are market sensitive. 
So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward."

The levers we're using Humphrey are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's -- as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from -- than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis.

All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity -- Genesis equities outperformed benchmark. So very, very strong fundamental performance. 
As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the #1 mutual fund family year-to-date, and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. 
We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. 
It also was the last of our what I would call in [indiscernible] Index. As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability.

I'll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of inequity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. 
After transitioning over 95% of our U.S. employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We'll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. 
During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiatives despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop by delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We're also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to markets. And we're exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our existing 2020 targets. 
Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I'll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. 
Turning now to our 2020 priorities on Slide 3. We remain on track to achieve our $140 million cost savings target for the whole year, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continue to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remain on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020 and are advancing on review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix, while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by the progress we're making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we're looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. 
On Slide 5, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed a AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our U.S. long-term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.25%. 
Lastly, we anticipate receiving the USD 1.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of Korea -- our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of our capital deployment plans, we'll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. 
Slide 6 shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don't have a one-sided exposure. 
In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the noncash effect of noneconomic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. 
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. 
PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income as well as market appreciation. 
Our International Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. 
Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to address the recent disturbing incidents of racial injustice and how we, as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on Slide 7. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. 
We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognize that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. 
It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. 
I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we'll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 8. The U.S. businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on 3 key priorities. First, we've implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions, aligned with our intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product, and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest rate-sensitive solutions. 
And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. 
Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance and have increased the use of our Fast Track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. Preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we've been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. 
Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter. More than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. 
This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. 
PGIM investments was the #1 ranked U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As expected, Life Planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life Planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Similar to Life Planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. [ In Chile ], market returns in the quarter were higher than average, and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. 
With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. 
We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted. And over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. 
With respect to interest rates, we've successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. 
We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. Second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple-quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."

The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help",890,"On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. 
To help you see this, I'll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. 
Then, we adjust for the following items: first, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the U.S. Next, we adjusted variable investment income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. 
Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period to period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our targeted returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. 
Next, there are other items that, combined, may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs, to be $130 million lower in the third quarter. This is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. 
In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And encaje income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. 
Fifth, we expect operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $25 million lower in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter, that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the U.S. population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our U.S. insurance businesses than previously estimated. 
Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. 
We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our U.S. employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. 
And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that, combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We're exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock-bound -- rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position.

I'll take a shot at that. But first, let me just bring it up a level and say as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks. 
The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them. And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps in transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued, so think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business, we'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor -- looking at selling the blocks. 
A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual product or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduce the retention limits that we have within our individual life business by way of example. 
Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we have that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. But we're also looking at the investment portfolio and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us.
And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital-light like, for instance, PGIM, our asset management business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about on a -- from a derisking standpoint. 
Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that?"

Thanks, Rob. So Ryan, let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we've taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix, becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? 
And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower-growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance, around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market-sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products and annuities and ILI. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million in cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on books of business that are market-sensitive. 
So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward."

And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember that sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the -- which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. The levers we're using, Humphrey, are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's, as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from -- than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. 
So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today, but we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into the year. And once we finished our work, we'll -- as Charlie indicated, we'll be transparent."

So retail flows are really a result of 3 things: very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity -- Jennison equities outperformed benchmark. So very, very strong fundamental performance. 
As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the #1 mutual fund family year-to-date and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. 
We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low fee rate mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. 
It also was the last of our what I would call [ shareholder ] index mandate. As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability. But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last 5 years, and we would expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years."

We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took actions in Korea, and we're considering those in Taiwan.

The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan has been negative for the last several years and the country  continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. 
So I guess what I would say is we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent.

I'll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of inequity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. 
After transitioning over 95% of our U.S. employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We'll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. 
During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiatives despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop by delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We're also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to markets. And we're exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our existing 2020 targets. 
Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I'll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. 
Turning now to our 2020 priorities on Slide 3. We remain on track to achieve our $140 million cost savings target for the whole year, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continue to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remain on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020 and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by the progress we're making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we're looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. 
On Slide 5, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed a AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our U.S. long-term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.25%. 
Lastly, we anticipate receiving the USD 1.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of Korea -- our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of our capital deployment plans, we'll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. 
Slide 6 shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don't have a one-sided exposure. 
In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the noncash effect of noneconomic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. 
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. 
PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income as well as market appreciation. 
Our International Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. 
Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to address the recent disturbing incidents of racial injustice and how we, as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on Slide 7. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. 
We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognize that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. 
It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. 
I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we'll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 8. The U.S. Businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on 3 key priorities. First, we've implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions, aligned with our intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product, and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest rate-sensitive solutions. 
And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. 
Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance and have increased the use of our Fast Track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. Preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we've been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. 
Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter. More than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. 
This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. 
PGIM investments was the #1 ranked U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As expected, Life Planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life Planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Similar to Life Planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. In Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average, and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. 
With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. 
We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted. And over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. 
With respect to interest rates, we've successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. 
We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. Second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple-quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646131042,2081780,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help",890,"On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. 
To help you see this, I'll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. 
Then, we adjust for the following items: first, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the U.S. Next, we adjusted variable investment income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. 
Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period to period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our targeted returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. 
Next, there are other items that, combined, may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs, to be $130 million lower in the third quarter. This is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. 
In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And encaje income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. 
Fifth, we expect operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $25 million lower in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter, that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the U.S. population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our U.S. insurance businesses than previously estimated. 
Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. 
We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our U.S. employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. 
And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that, combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We're exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock-bound -- rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position.

I'll take a shot at that. But first, let me just bring it up a level and say as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks. 
The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them. And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps in transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued, so think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business, we'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor -- looking at selling the blocks. 
A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual product or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduce the retention limits that we have within our individual life business by way of example. 
Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we have that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. But we're also looking at the investment portfolio and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us.
And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital-light like, for instance, PGIM, our asset management business.

Thanks, Rob. So Ryan, let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we've taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix, becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? 
And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower-growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance, around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market-sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products in annuities and ILI. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on books of business that are market-sensitive. 
So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward."

So as we have been in the course of executing on the efficiency initiatives that we had articulated earlier in the year, earlier last year, we've actually accelerated those actions. And in the course of doing so, we've actually institutionalized continuous transformation capability. And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember that sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the -- which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. The levers we're using, Humphrey, are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's, as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from -- than what we've articulated to date. We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. 
So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today, but we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into the year. And once we finished our work, we'll -- as Charlie indicated, we'll be transparent."

So retail flows are really a result of 3 things: very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity -- Jennison equities outperformed benchmark. So very, very strong fundamental performance. 
As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the #1 mutual fund family year-to-date and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. 
We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low fee rate mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. 
It also was the last of our what I would call [ shareholder ] index mandate. As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability. But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last 5 years, and we would expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years."

Let me just take a step back and then I'll answer your question directly, but I'll make a comment about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization.

You've seen us take some bold action in terms of Italy, Poland, Korea, potentially Taiwan, et cetera.

In the case of the Life Planners, we were actually able to take what was an initial subsidy that was sort of an uncharacteristic payment that we have, and we were able to roll it into their bonusable plan.

So we followed the same process we've had for a number of years. It's also important to know how we grade into that long-term assumption. We do that over 10 years. And the first 2 years follows the forward curve. And as a result, it's not just the long-term assumption but the path with which we get there.

Recall that across our portfolio, our loan to values are actually quite low. And so as a result of that, when we defer principal, we're actually not particularly concerned about that because we know that the principal amount is actually quite safe. The average loan-to-value across our entire portfolio based on our internal appraisals is 56-ish percent. Using external appraisals, it will be about 10 points lower than that, so less than 50%.

We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took actions in Korea, and we're considering those in Taiwan.

The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan has been negative for the last several years and the country  continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. 
So I guess what I would say is we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent.

I'll start by saying we hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. 
The events of the past several months have created unforeseen new difficulties for people around the world, while further exposing the deep-seated problem of inequity in our society. It's in times like these that we believe our company's purpose of solving the financial challenges of our changing world and standing by our employees, customers and communities is most important. 
After transitioning over 95% of our U.S. employees and most of our international employees to remote work in March, we continue to seamlessly serve customers, while the vast majority of our employees around the world continue to work in that fashion. This allows us to exercise utmost caution as we evaluate how and when to return to the workplace. In the meantime, I am so proud of our people and how they continue to focus on meeting the evolving needs of our customers, many of whom face new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact. We'll continue to innovate the ways we serve our customers during and after the pandemic. 
During the second quarter, we maintained a clear focus on executing against our 2020 initiatives despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop by delivering on progress on our cost savings targets, aggressively repricing and pivoting products to mitigate the impact of low rates on our performance and rotating our international earnings mix. We're also focused on identifying opportunities for further action, particularly as we look to continue to reduce our sensitivity to markets. And we're exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our existing 2020 targets. 
Throughout this period, we benefited from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which gives us the confidence and the flexibility to navigate changes to the economic environment. I'll touch on each of these points in greater detail before turning it over to Rob and Ken for a look at our second quarter results. 
Turning now to our 2020 priorities on Slide 3. We remain on track to achieve our $140 million cost savings target for the whole year, and have achieved $75 million in savings year-to-date, with $45 million in the second quarter. We also continue to make progress in shifting our international earnings mix to higher growth markets. We remain on track to close on the sale of Prudential of Korea in the second half of 2020 and are advancing our review of strategic options for Prudential of Taiwan, which may include a sale. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are aggressively modifying our product mix while exercising a highly disciplined approach to pricing in this low interest rate environment. 
Turning to Slide 4. While we are encouraged by the progress we're making to position our businesses and operations for the future, we continue to look at ways to work smarter and more efficiently in order to achieve cost savings on top of our target of $500 million by 2022. This includes using technology and automation, and leveraging the learnings from operating in a remote work environment to optimize how and where we work. In addition, we're looking at other ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate the impact of market sensitivity. 
On Slide 5, we note how we're embarking on these initiatives with the foundational strength provided by our balance sheet and robust capital position, including highly liquid assets of $4.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to exceed a AA financial strength rating. Our second quarter assumption update had a modest effect on our financial results, even as we reduced our U.S. long-term interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.25%. 
Lastly, we anticipate receiving the USD 1.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of Korea -- our Korea business by the end of the year. In terms of our capital deployment plans, we'll continue to monitor developments in the credit markets and the economy to determine our strategy. 
Slide 6 shows our second quarter financial results. This quarter exemplified the benefits of our thoughtful approach to risk management and our complementary business mix. We aim to balance mortality and longevity risk, so we don't have a one-sided exposure. 
In the quarter, we had net favorable underwriting experience. Our adjusted operating income was $931 million in the quarter. While we recorded a net GAAP loss, driven primarily by the noncash effect of noneconomic market impacts, which have no effect on our regulatory capital position. 
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $455 million due to more favorable underwriting, offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower fee and spread income. 
PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $324 million as well as record assets under management of $1.4 trillion, a 9% increase from the year earlier period. This growth reflected strong flows into fixed income as well as market appreciation. 
Our International Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $693 million, as more favorable underwriting, higher earnings from joint ventures and business growth were offset by the unfavorable impact of the assumption update and lower spread income and higher expenses. 
Before turning it over to Rob, I'd like to address the recent disturbing incidents of racial injustice and how we, as an organization, are responding to the deep-seated and persistent problem of racism and inequity in society. Last month, we announced commitments to advance racial equity, as highlighted on Slide 7. These commitments were borne out of the courageous candor of our employees, who have shared their experiences and their expectations, and the listening that is taking place all across Prudential. Taking a bottom-up approach, we developed concrete and measurable actions spanning our talent practices to how we design and deliver products, to the investments we make and how we foster social and racial equity in the communities where we work and do business. 
We already had a substantive set of programs underway and a body of work that reflects our long-standing commitment to racial equity, including investing over $1 billion in our hometown of Newark. We recognize that this moment calls for us to amplify what Prudential has already been doing to drive change within our company and within society. 
It is a moral and it is a business imperative that aligns directly with our company's purpose to solve the financial challenges of our changing world as well as our multi-stakeholder commitments to employees, customers, shareholders and society. We stand by the promises we make, and we are prepared to be judged for our actions to support our colleagues, customers and communities today and over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob."

And I want to reemphasize your comment about our commitment as a management team to supporting racial equity. This is an issue that is aligned to our purpose, it's part of the fabric of our culture and critical to our success as an organization. 
I'll now provide an update on how we are executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and International Businesses as well as on the outlook for these businesses, and we'll also provide an update on our investment portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 8. The U.S. Businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We continue to execute on 3 key priorities. First, we've implemented pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix, while protecting profitability. For example, we took aggressive pricing actions, aligned with our intention to significantly reduce sales of HDI, our legacy flagship VA product, and launched FlexGuard, our buffered annuity product, which has been well received by the market, supporting our product mix shift to less sensitive, less interest rate-sensitive solutions. 
And in our Individual Life business, we suspended sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. This will result in the continued shift to variable life and other less interest rate-sensitive products. We will continue to take product and pricing actions, including steps to diversify our mix of business, to maintain profitability in this interest rate environment. As a result, we expect Individual Annuities and Individual Life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. 
Second, as the needs of our customers rapidly evolve, including in response to COVID-19 and its economic impact, we are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance customer engagement and efficiency. For example, we've expanded our process to electronically deliver policies from application submission to policy issuance and have increased the use of our Fast Track automated underwriting process. And we have expanded the use of electronic signatures and self-service customer capabilities across our businesses. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. The pandemic has amplified the financial wellness challenges that many U.S. households face and has highlighted the importance of our financial wellness platform and our life insurance, retirement and financial planning solutions. We also continue to see increasing interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. Preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we've been progressing well with our agent onboarding and training process. 
Now turning to Slide 9. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager business model. Our assets under management reached a record level of $1.4 trillion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, driven by net flows as well as the positive impact from equity and credit markets. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong and has rebounded from the temporary downturn in the first quarter. More than 85% of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. 
This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated nearly $4 billion of net third-party flows during the second quarter, driven by record retail flows of $9 billion. Institutional outflows were driven by a single passive equity client redemption. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $10 billion, as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. 
PGIM investments was the #1 ranked U.S. mutual fund franchise across active and passive asset managers based on net year-to-date sales. PGIM's asset management fees were up 3% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, other related revenues increased primarily due to higher strategic investment earnings as a result of strong investment performance and the effect of credit spreads tightening, reversing the widening that had occurred in the first quarter. We also continue to focus on cost discipline to fund growth and further increase our operating leverage. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our International Businesses, including our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. As expected, Life Planner sales decreased 30% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower sales in Japan due to COVID-19-related restrictions on sales activities. Life Planner headcount, however, increased 5% compared to a year ago. 
Similar to Life Planner, sales for Gibraltar were 34% lower, but the number of life consultants has declined as we continue to focus on quality distribution. In Chile, market returns in the quarter were higher than average, and that contributed to an operating income benefit of approximately $25 million, reversing the impact we experienced in the first quarter. 
With respect to expenses across international, we provided appropriate sales support to protect and care for our captive distribution, as we noted last quarter. This contributed $55 million to expenses, which we expect to trend lower in the second half of the year. 
We have seen some recovery in Japan sales beginning in June as the state of emergency was lifted. And over time, we expect sales to normalize. In addition, to mitigate the impacts of reduced face-to-face sales, our agents have adapted to increased usage of virtual tools to connect with customers, and we have seen early signs of success. We believe that our needs-based selling approach and death protection product focus continue to provide important value to our customers. 
With respect to interest rates, we've successfully managed through decades of low interest rates and other market challenges in Japan. As you have seen us do in the past, we adjust our product offering quickly to meet the needs and preferences of our customers, while also achieving our return expectations. We have already taken actions and will continue to do so as needed as we move forward. 
Now turning to Slide 11. We have a conservative, quality-focused investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. 
We also leveraged PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. Year-to-date credit migration and losses have trended below our expectations. Second quarter credit losses were $139 million, driven by energy and consumer cyclical sectors. While we expect credit losses to be a multiple-quarter story, we feel comfortable that our exposure is manageable and that we are well capitalized to weather whatever emerges. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646131042,2102569,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. To help",890,"On Slide 12, which provides insight into earnings for the third quarter relative to our second quarter results. The key point is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, primarily reflecting higher equity markets. 
To help you see this, I'll start with pretax adjusted operating income in the second quarter, which was $931 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on an after-tax basis. 
Then, we adjust for the following items: first, the annual review of assumptions and other refinements resulted in a net charge of $334 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by a reduction of our long-term interest rate assumption by 50 basis points in the U.S. Next, we adjusted variable investment income to a normalized level, which is worth $130 million. 
Please note that while we have not included an adjustment for variable investment income for the third quarter, the potential exists for continued revaluation of private equity and real estate investments due to the current adverse economic conditions. While returns of our alternative investment portfolio are currently lower than our target returns, and will vary period to period, over time, this portfolio has generated income above our targeted returns. Third, we adjusted underwriting experience by $155 million. This reflects $100 million of favorable experience in the second quarter, primarily driven by reserve gains in retirement. We estimate claims experience in the third quarter will include $55 million for COVID-19. 
Next, there are other items that, combined, may be $75 million more favorable in the third quarter, primarily related to expenses and markets. We expect expenses, including implementation costs, to be $130 million lower in the third quarter. This is primarily due to legal expenses in the second quarter. 
In addition, due to favorable markets in the second quarter, other related revenues in PGIM benefited by $45 million. And encaje income in our Gibraltar segment also benefited by $25 million. 
Fifth, we expect operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $25 million lower in the third quarter. And last, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.63 per share for the third quarter. Please note that this baseline includes items specific to the third quarter, that reduced EPS by approximately $0.19 per share. While we have provided these items to consider, there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the third quarter. 
On Slide 13, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. We have included a sensitivity for operating income based on the U.S. population experiencing 100,000 of incremental deaths due to the pandemic. We estimate that this may lower operating income by $70 million. And this is less than the sensitivity we provided on our last earnings call, as we have seen a lower fatality rate due to COVID-19 in our U.S. insurance businesses than previously estimated. 
Our third quarter baseline includes a net impact for mortality due to COVID-19 of approximately $55 million. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. 
We have also reduced our estimate for incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 and have estimated the potential reduction in other operating costs, such as for travel and entertainment. In the second half of 2020, we expect to incur incremental operating costs of $60 million due to COVID-19, with $40 million in the third quarter and $20 million in the fourth quarter. 
The estimate of these costs is lower than what we provided on our last call, primarily due to lower health benefit costs of our U.S. employees and lower cost to support our sales professionals in Japan as their productivity is improving faster than previously estimated. We also expect to have $30 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses in the second half of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets, and we maintain liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. We have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $4.5 billion at the end of the quarter. We expect to receive net proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of our Prudential of Korea business following the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of this year. 
And another source of funding is free cash flow from our businesses. In May, we added a new $1.5 billion contingent capital facility that, combined with our previous facility, brings our total available contingent capital funding resources to $3 billion. 
Turning to Slide 15. And in summary, we remain on track with our objectives for the year as we accelerate the execution of our initiatives. We're exploring the potential to increase our cost savings initiative and looking at additional ways to build upon our repricing and product shift to further mitigate market impacts. And we maintain a rock-bound -- rock-solid balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity position.

While there was fatalities in the U.K. in the second quarter, right now, that seems to be more contained, and we wouldn't expect that to continue given the current fatality rates.

I'll take a shot at that. But first, let me just bring it up a level and say as we sort of think about our strategy on a go-forward basis, we think about the elements of that is, in the first instance, simplifying and derisking the business as we articulated in our opening remarks. 
The other components of that are about improving near-term earnings through the efficiency initiatives that we've talked about and which we think has some expansion opportunity associated with them. And then obviously, continue to expand our addressable market in order to support longer-term growth. Specifically with regard to the derisking, I would characterize the repricing and product shifts that we've done as sort of the first steps in transitioning to lower volatility, less interest rate and general market sensitivity across our businesses. For those products that we've either stepped back from or actually explicitly discontinued, so think about that as being HDI in the variable annuities business and guaranteed universal life in the life business, we'll look actively at opportunities to optimize the economics of the legacy blocks that are associated with those products. And those options range anywhere from simply sort of just running off the blocks to reinsuring indoor -- looking at selling the blocks. 
A couple of other things outside of that across our products, we're actually looking actively at product design as well as individual and aggregate limits that could reduce the amount of potential volatility that we get from any individual product or grouping of products. So you saw us significantly reduce the retention limits that we have within our individual life business by way of example. 
Charlie hit on financial flexibility and resiliency, so we're going to retain our capital in order to make sure that we have that in place. And we think that, that's an element of the derisking, at least in the near term. But we're also looking at the investment portfolio and looking at strategic asset allocation, re-optimizing sort of the risk return and volatility trade-offs that are associated with our equity credit and our interest rate exposures, in light of where we are in the cycle and the opportunities that are in front of us.
And I guess the last thing I'd mention is that as we look at the growth of the business, on a go-forward basis, our strategic emphasis is really on growing the elements of our business that are less rate-sensitive and more predictable and more capital-light like, for instance, PGIM, our asset management business. So those would be the primary things that we're thinking about on a -- from a derisking standpoint. 
Charlie, I don't know if there's any further color you'd want to add on to that?"

Thanks, Rob. So Ryan, let me just try and connect some dots. Because over the past 18 months, as Rob said, we've taken actions to begin to accomplish many of the objectives that Rob articulated, namely lower market sensitivity, lower capital intensity of our business mix, becoming more competitive in terms of serving our customers with processes, better processes and lower costs. And then finally, as Rob said, increasing growth, right? 
And so let me just tick through a number of things that we've done in order to achieve those objectives. We're sold or selling out of lower-growth businesses, Italy, Poland, Korea and exploring options for Taiwan. We acquired assurance, around which we have high conviction about growth in a business that isn't as market-sensitive, so lower risk. We've significantly reduced or stopped selling certainly highly interest rate-sensitive products in annuities and ILI. We introduced less market-sensitive products such as the buffered annuity. We repriced almost our entire product line. We announced and are executing on our future work initiative, which will produce $500 million cost savings with the potential to do more. And as Rob said, we're currently exploring other options on books of business that are market-sensitive. 
So we're executing on a series of incremental changes that we believe will lead to fundamental change in our business mix and ultimately, the trajectory of the firm as we go forward. So that's a foundation off of which we are going to grow going forward."

You cut out a little bit, but I think I understood your question. So as we have been in the course of executing on the efficiency initiatives that we had articulated earlier in the year, earlier last year, we've actually accelerated those actions. 
And in the course of doing so, we've actually institutionalized continuous transformation capability. And as a result of that, we're generating new ideas and strategies for further efficiencies that enhance customer experiences. Remember that sort of the first priority of that is they enable our businesses, putting us in more competitive positions, and it increases our operating profits, particularly in light of the -- which is needed in particular in light of the impact of earnings of a low rate environment. 
The levers we're using, Humphrey, are pretty much the things that we've done to date. So increased use of technology and automation, process improvements, sourcing, org design, all the things that are classic. We just think there's, as a result of this continuous process, much further that we can go from -- than what we've articulated to date. 
We're also contemplating learnings from the crisis and some of the implications of the pandemic and our experience in that on things like remote work, changes in communications and travel and use of technology on a go-forward basis. 
So all of that leads us to be optimistic that we can expand materially from where we are today, but we're not ready to quantify that. We'll provide more guidance on that when we get further into the year. And once we finished our work, we'll -- as Charlie indicated, we'll be transparent."

So retail flows are really a result of 3 things: very strong investment management performance, a broad and wide product portfolio and strong distribution. And we're performing well on all of those fronts. Our investment performance in the second quarter was very strong. All of our PGIM fixed income strategies outperformed benchmark. 96% of our equity -- Jennison equities outperformed benchmark. So very, very strong fundamental performance. 
As you know, we've been building out our global distribution over time. So we were actually quite pleased with our flows in the quarter. We were the #1 mutual fund family year-to-date and had $9.5 billion in positive retail flows. 
We did have the $4.5 billion index passive flow related to QMA. That was a very low fee rate mandate. So think in the neighborhood of 1 to 2 bps. So literally, it was less than $1 million in fees. 
It also was the last of our, what I would call [ shareholder ] index mandate. As you look forward, quarter-to-quarter, there will be variability. But over the long run, our fundamental investment performance, the strength of our distribution, we have had strong organic flows over the last 5 years, and we would expect that to continue as we look forward over the next several years."

Let me just take a step back and then I'll answer your question directly, but I'll make a comment about how we think about capital allocation and particular optimization. Because when we look across our businesses, what we try and do both domestically and internationally is ensure we're optimizing that capital deployment. 
So we've mentioned in the past that we're looking at or continue to look at businesses such as ILI annuities and some of our international operations as well as LTC. You've seen us take some bold action in terms of Italy, Poland, Korea, potentially Taiwan, et cetera. So what we're going to do is -- and what we can assure you is that we will continue to look to ways to optimize capital and capital deployment to maximize outcomes for shareholders, right, be that through significant dispositions, whatever flavor that may take, through potential share repurchases or through acquisitions. 
And right now, we have acknowledged and we'll continue to acknowledge that there's a high hurdle for any major acquisition, given where our stock price is trading. We get that. But we're looking, as you've seen in the actions we've taken to date over the last 18 months. And I think what you'll see us do going forward is look at all our businesses in order to optimize the capital we deploy and how we do that.

We actually started to see a pretty good bounce back in June to the point where we were starting to get close to even to 2019 sales in both Japan and in Brazil. And that has continued and actually modestly strengthened in the month of July. So we are seeing a pretty good sales recovery, and we're encouraged. But of course, that is -- that has to be tempered by any kind of resurgence that could occur. 
In the case of the Life Planners, we were actually able to take what was an initial subsidy that was sort of an uncharacteristic payment that we have, and we were able to roll it into their bonusable plan. So a portion of the amount that we have for POJ is actually being deferred into their sales comp. So you're not seeing it as directly, but it's still there."

So we followed the same process we've had for a number of years. It's also important to know how we grade into that long-term assumption. We do that over 10 years. And the first 2 years follows the forward curve. And as a result, it's not just the long-term assumption but the path with which we get there. And so over the next 5 years, our average rate would be 1.25%. In 10 years, it's about 1.9%. And so again, we have a pretty established process.

We've provided forbearance in 6% of those instances, and the remaining 2% are under review, and that excludes a little bit that we've gotten requests on that were declined. But in that, only about 1% of the requests have resulted in a deferral of interest. In all other instances, we remain current on interest and they've been deferrals of principal.
Recall that across our portfolio, our loan to values are actually quite low. And so as a result of that, when we defer principal, we're actually not particularly concerned about that because we know that the principal amount is actually quite safe. The average loan-to-value across our entire portfolio based on our internal appraisals is 56-ish percent. Using external appraisals, it will be about 10 points lower than that, so less than 50%. And so given that low LTV, accommodations on amortization of principal or repayment of principal, we believe, is a prudent thing to be doing.

We were seeing low growth in the developed markets in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And you saw that we took actions in Korea, and we're considering those in Taiwan.

The business generates attractive returns over our cost of capital and it generates a lot of free cash flow to the parent. So we really like our Japan operation, and we continue to invest in it. That being said, overall premium growth in Japan has been negative for the last several years and the country  continues to face demographic challenges. So the fact that we've been able to continue to grow in POJ has been a significant outperformance in the country. 
So I guess what I would say is we expect kind of low single-digit growth in Japan. And if we're achieving that, that's actually very strong relative performance. And then in the context of a business system that's creating a lot of value and cash to the parent.

One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top-ranked companies based on net flows this year. 
In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities through our FlexGuard buffered annuity product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity at a time when customers face new challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this quarter. And in Japan, our Life Planner model, with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging customers, continues to be resilient as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. 
During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also continued to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial footing to navigate changes in the current environment.
Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter's call, we mentioned that we were exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this year, we have realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings program to $750 million. 
With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Taiwan to [Taishan] Financial Holding and expect the transaction to close in 2021 subject to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and receive proceeds of USD 1.6 billion. 
And finally, we continued to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate-sensitive solutions, while aggressively repricing certain existing products. As an example, in annuities we are focusing on our efforts on delivering protected outcome solutions like our FlexGuard product. And we're discontinuing all sales of our traditional variable annuities with guaranteed link benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities for lots of business, including reinsurance and other transactions.
Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds AA financial strength level. The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term growth, while navigating the current and future market environment. 
We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets. While they have been developing better than previously expected, we don't intend to reinstate buybacks this year. We believe this is prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly uncertain. We'll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized and approved by the Board.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And after-tax adjusted earnings per share was $3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses. 
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment spread, offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business and less favorable underwriting driven by COVID-19-related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income of $775 million as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning."
1038328,646131298,2128710,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2020",2020-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we're executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio.Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses",1079,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we're executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio.
Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on 3 key priorities: first, we continued to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix while protecting profitability. For example, we are further pivoting to less interest rate-sensitive solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, including both our highest daily income and Prudential defined income products. In our individual life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates, in addition to suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. In addition, we continued to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business. 
Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact, we're evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt and develop new ways of working effectively in remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology, optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these and other opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a 50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target. 
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continued to see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform for customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerated our agent onboarding and training processes. While we are only 3 weeks into the annual enrollment period, we are pleased with the customer demand that we're seeing, which is driving considerable sales growth. 
Now turning to Slide 7. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager model. PGIM's strong investment performance, diversified global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher-returning and income-generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong flows, robust investment performance as well as market appreciation. 
PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong, with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows, driven by a continued appetite for fixed income strategies partially offset the moderating equity outflows. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise. 
The combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM investments being ranked the second highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM's asset management fees were up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, an increase in other related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed investment earnings, record-high agency loan production and higher incentive fees. 
PGIM's operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter, aided by the strong other related revenues as we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin increases from operating leverage. While PGIM's operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle.
Turning to Slide 8. Our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also employing more virtual tools for non-face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the resilience of the Life Planner model, the easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner head count increased 3% compared to a year ago due to stable recruitment and lower resignations. 
Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar's life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter, with sales returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021. 
Current order-adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates, and we anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar's higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken pricing actions, and we'll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had $15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect will moderate in future quarters.
Now turning to Slide 9. We have a conservative high-quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification, and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. 
There has been a slowdown in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date credit migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. 
We remain confident that we are well capitalized to weather whatever might emerge in the future. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646131298,2128710,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2020",2020-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was [ $1.6 billion ] and resulted in earnings per share of $3.2",613,"Thanks, Rob. 
I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was [ $1.6 billion ] and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 on an after-tax basis. 
We then adjust for the following items: First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million.  Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains in retirement and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experienced in the fourth quarter. Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items. 
These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity markets as of quarter end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter. 
In addition as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by $250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded, with incremental net savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings call in February.
On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income per 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at $70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $60 million due to COVID-19. 
The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue to expect incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses.
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges. 
And we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Prudential Korea. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities.
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute our strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program. And we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which includes -- which gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment.

But Eric, over the past couple of years, we've been really active in beginning to change our business mix. So as you know, we've sold our operations in Poland, Italy and Korea, now have agreement in Taiwan. And we continue to focus on rotating our earnings mix to higher-growth markets internationally. 
Now looking at the U.S. in terms of changing the focus within the business, we're on a path to derisking and have made major pivots to less interest rate-sensitive and more capital-light solutions in our individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically you've seen us pivot away from VAs with lifetime income guarantees to less market-sensitive products. And at the same time, you've seen us in our life business pivot to simpler nonguaranteed products. 
But what we've also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I've said that we'll explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks. But I'd add the caveat that these type of transactions are complex and they take time. And as we explore our options, we want to make sure that we're making good economic decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders.

As we discussed sort of from a lessons learning perspective from last year, we've done a lot this year to make sure that we were better prepared for the annual enrollment period.

And we began to bring on agents this year in the month of July, which was much earlier than last year. 
So I repeat what Bob said, we're only about 3 weeks into the season, but we certainly see evidence that our investments are paying off and that we're having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having said that, about 50% of industry-wide Medicare Advantage transactions occur in the last 2 weeks of the annual enrollment period, and that's the first 2 weeks of December.

If we think about 2021 at this point, do you have a preference of buybacks or M&A?

One, again I would caution the people in thinking we're going to free up capital immediately. These transactions take a long time, and therefore we have to think through that. 
Secondly, I think it depends on the deal. What we have said before is given where our stock price is, there's a fairly high hurdle, right? 
On the other hand to your point, there could be some very interesting things on the market. So we're going to have to balance, if you will, short-term accretion from stock buybacks and long-term growth. And we'll have to weigh those 2 against the opportunity set that's out there and the stock purchase price at the time."

We adjusted our compensation structure for life consultants to better balance policyholder servicing, things like customer persistency and so forth with new business production.

Overall the commissions have not actually changed, but our immediate run rate was impacted by roughly $10 million a quarter, and we view this as permanent. Now we recapture that over the life of the products, but that takes quite a while to pick up. By the way, we do not expect this to have any impact on Gibraltar's cash flow.

Ours was very much about building a set of capabilities that could really reach people when, where and how they want it. So there was a real digital focus to what we've built. We've had accelerating success. If you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish. 
At this point, we've had a large portion of our employers adopt our capabilities. We have 20 million individuals that have access to the platform. That's ahead of our goals for 2020. We've what we word permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access, we get access to market our retail solutions. That is also ahead of our goals. And at this point, we've put 15,000 retail customers into Prudential through the platform. 
As COVID came in, the base capabilities were such that we were able to pretty quickly even expand upon, as an example, our Prudential pathway program and make it purely digital with webinar capabilities. And at this point, that's now reaching about 8.5 million folks. So we don't see the current environment actually hindering us at all, and it's really about how we built the whole platform."

To begin, I hope that you, your families and colleagues remain safe and healthy. As the global health pandemic continues, we remain intently focused as a company on caring for our employees and the communities in which we live and work as well as serving the evolving needs of our customers and other stakeholders in the current environment. We are also incredibly proud and grateful for the continued dedication and commitment that our employees have shown in fulfilling our company purpose: of making lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world.  
I'd like to highlight a few of the ways in which we're serving the unique and evolving needs of our customers, who now more than ever are relying on Prudential to address their financial challenges.  
Since the beginning of the pandemic, PGIM has focused on providing clients with timely portfolio updates and asset allocation ideas. Our operational resilience, diversified global business model and strong performance has allowed us to support our clients.  
One example of the success is the growth of our U.S. mutual funds, where we are one of the top-ranked companies based on net flows this year.  
In our U.S. businesses, we continue to pivot within annuities through our FlexGuard buffered annuity product, which offers downside protection and upside opportunity at a time when customers face new challenges in protecting and growing their retirement assets. Following its accelerated launch to market in the second quarter, FlexGuard continues to gain momentum, accounting for 38% of our annuity sales this quarter.
And in Japan, our Life Planner model with its highly personalized and customized approach to engaging customers, continues to be resilient, as demonstrated by our strong sales this quarter. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategic priorities for 2020, despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, including taking additional steps to expand our cost savings program. We also continued to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which places us on sound financial footing to navigate changes in the current environment. 
Turning now to 2020 priorities on Slide 3. On last quarter's call, we mentioned that we were exploring the potential to generate additional cost savings on top of our 2022 plan. Through the third quarter of this year, we have realized approximately $135 million of our $500 million cost savings program. Based on our progress of accelerating the savings realized and creating new ways of working, we now expect to generate an incremental $250 million in efficiencies by the end of 2023, bringing our total cost savings program to $750 million.  
With respect to rotating the international earnings mix, during the quarter we announced an agreement to sell Prudential of Taiwan to Taishin Financial Holding, and expect the transaction to close in 2021, subject to all regulatory approvals. And we also closed on our transaction to divest Prudential of Korea and receive proceeds of USD 1.6 billion.  
And finally, we continue to take additional steps across the company to reduce our exposure to changes in markets and rates by shifting sales momentum to less interest rate-sensitive solutions, while aggressively repricing certain existing products. As an example, in annuities we are focusing on our efforts on delivering protected outcome solutions like our FlexGuard product. And we're discontinuing all sales of our traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. We will also explore strategic opportunities for blocks of business, including reinsurance and other transactions. 
Turning to Slide 4. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities, we remain grounded by our rock-solid balance sheet, including highly liquid assets of $6.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries continue to hold capital that exceeds AA financial strength level. The financial strength gives us the confidence and the flexibility to manage our business for long-term growth, while navigating the current and future market environment.  
We also continue to closely monitor conditions in the credit markets. While they have been developing better than previously expected, we don't intend to reinstate buybacks this year. We believe this is prudent as the duration and severity of the pandemic and its effect on the economy remain highly uncertain. We'll provide more details on our 2021 capital deployment plans once they have been finalized and approved by the Board. 
Turning to Slide 5. I'll now take a moment to highlight our financial results for the third quarter. Pretax adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And after-tax adjusted earnings per share was $3.21, which benefited in part from strong variable investment income across our businesses.
Our U.S. businesses reported adjusted operating income of $873 million due to higher net investment spread, offset by lower net fee income in our individual annuities business and less favorable underwriting driven by COVID-19-related net mortality experience. PGIM reported record adjusted operating income of $370 million, driven by record assets under management of $1.4 trillion and higher other related revenues. The 11% growth in assets under management reflects strong flows, robust investment performance and market appreciation. Our international businesses reported adjusted operating income of $775 million as business growth, lower expenses and more favorable underwriting results were partially offset by lower earnings from joint venture investments and lower net investment spread.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for more specific details on our business performance during the third quarter. Thank you all for your time this morning."
1038328,646131298,2128845,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2020",2020-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we're executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio. Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesse",1081,"Thank you, Charlie. I'll provide an update on how we're executing on our strategy within our U.S., PGIM and international businesses, the outlook for these businesses and a brief update on our investment portfolio. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our U.S. businesses produced a diversified source of earnings from fees, net investment spread and underwriting income. We made progress in the quarter executing on 3 key priorities: first, we continued to implement pricing and product actions to simplify and derisk our business mix while protecting profitability. For example, we are further pivoting to less interest rate-sensitive solutions in individual annuities by discontinuing sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits, including both our highest daily income and Prudential defined income products. In our individual life business, we are repricing products to mitigate the impact of low rates, in addition to suspending sales of our single life guaranteed universal life product in July. As a result of these actions, we expect individual annuities and individual life sales to continue to move lower in the near term. In addition, we continued to adjust crediting rates in our retirement business.
Second, as the needs of our customers change, including in response to COVID and its economic impact, we're evolving the way we work. We continue to adapt and develop new ways of working effectively in remote locations and expect to recognize additional cost savings as we expand the use of technology, optimize our real estate footprint and benefit from a more efficient workforce. As Charlie mentioned, these and other opportunities to further efficiencies and improve our customer experience have resulted in a 50% increase in our originally planned $500 million earnings improvement target.  
And third, we remain committed to expanding our addressable market. For example, we continued to see strong interest in our Assurance IQ platform from customers in the health care, life and P&C lines of business. In preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter, we accelerated our agent onboarding and training processes. While we are only 3 weeks into the annual enrollment period, we are pleased with the customer demand that we're seeing, which is driving considerable sales growth.  
Now turning to Slide 7. PGIM is a top 10 global investment manager that continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of its multi-manager model. PGIM's strong investment performance and diversified global investment capabilities across public and private asset classes, especially higher-returning and income-generating strategies across fixed income, alternatives, real estate and equities, position us favorably to continue to capture flows amidst industry-wide dislocation. Our assets under management reached a record level of over $1.4 trillion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong flows, robust investment performance as well as market appreciation. PGIM's long-term investment performance remains strong, with more than 90% of assets under management outperforming their benchmarks. This strong investment performance, coupled with diversified investment capabilities across asset classes, regions and client segments, has led to continued growth. We generated over $7 billion of third-party net flows during the quarter, including $5.3 billion of retail flows and $2 billion of institutional flows, driven by a continued appetite for fixed income strategies partially offset the moderating equity outflows. Our public fixed income platform generated flows of $11.6 billion as it continues to benefit from our broad suite of strategies and the leading position of our franchise.  
And the combination of customer demand, fund performance and investments in product development and distribution over the past several years has resulted in PGIM investments being ranked the second highest U.S. mutual fund franchise based on year-to-date net flows. PGIM's asset management fees were up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by the growth in average assets under management. In addition, an increase in other related revenues was driven by an increase in co-investment and seed investment earnings, record-high agency loan production and higher incentive fees.  
PGIM's operating margin exceeded 37% for the quarter, aided by the strong other related revenues as we continue to focus on generating efficiencies to fund growth investments and on delivering margin increases from operating leverage. While PGIM's operating margin will vary with market conditions, we expect margins to remain in the 30% range across the cycle. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our international business includes our Japanese life insurance operation, where we have a differentiated multichannel distribution model as well as other operations focused on high-growth markets. Our sales this quarter demonstrated the strength of our distribution channels and the continuing customer demand for the protection and retirement products we offer. Our distribution channels are also employing more virtual tools for non-face-to-face sales and have benefited from the easing of pandemic related restrictions. Life Planner sales increased 57% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the resilience of the Life Planner model, the easing of COVID restrictions in Japan, and higher sales ahead of U.S. dollar-denominated product repricing in August. Life Planner head count increased 3% compared to a year ago due to stable recruitment and lower resignations.  
Similar to Life Planner, sales across Gibraltar's life consultant, independent agent and bank channels also increased in total by 30%. We believe a degree of sales were pulled forward into the current quarter due to repricing actions. And therefore we expect a lower level of sales in the fourth quarter, with sales returning to more normal levels over time beginning in 2021.  
Current order-adjusted operating income continued to be impacted by low interest rates, and we anticipate this trend to continue given Gibraltar's higher exposure to U.S. dollar products. We have taken pricing actions, and we'll continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient. In addition, we had $15 million of COVID response costs primarily to support our life consultants in Gibraltar, which we expect will moderate in future quarters. 
Now turning to Slide 9. We have a conservative high-quality investment portfolio that reflects our robust asset liability management practices, commitment to broad diversification, and a disciplined interest rate risk management framework. We also leverage PGIM's expertise across multiple asset classes, including its deep and long-standing experience in private placements and real estate. There has been a slowdown in the pace of credit migration and impairments since the first quarter of this year, with year-to-date credit migration and losses below our expectations. For the third quarter, credit losses were just $12 million. We remain confident that we are well capitalized to weather whatever might emerge in the future. And with that, I'll hand it over to Ken."
1038328,646131298,2128845,"Prudential Financial, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2020",2020-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Prudential Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob.  I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 o",611,"Thanks, Rob.  
I'll begin on Slide 10, which provides insight into earnings for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results. Pretax adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $1.6 billion and resulted in earnings per share of $3.21 on an after-tax basis. We then adjust for the following items: First, variable investment income outperformed expectations in the third quarter, which is worth $215 million. Second, we adjust underwriting experience by a net $35 million. This includes seasonally lower reserve gains in retirement and an estimate of $60 million for COVID-19 claims experienced in the fourth quarter.
Third, we expect expenses and other items to be $70 million higher in the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonal expenses and implementation costs. Fourth, we expect the net operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million lower in the fourth quarter. Fifth, we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by $15 million, reflecting the difference between new money rates and disposition yields of our investment portfolio. And last, we expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to normalize for third quarter items.  
These items combined get us to a baseline of $2.48 per share for the fourth quarter. I'll note that if you exclude items specific to the fourth quarter, earnings per share would be $2.93. The key takeaway is that our underlying earnings power increased slightly from last quarter, including the benefit from higher equity markets as of quarter end. While we have provided these items to consider, please note that there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the fourth quarter.  
In addition as we look forward, we have increased the expected benefits from our cost savings program by $250 million by the end of 2023. We expect these benefits will be largely self-funded, with incremental net savings emerging in 2022 and 2023. We will provide additional details about this program on our earnings call in February. 
On Slide 11, we provided an update on the potential impact of the pandemic. The estimated sensitivity of operating income per 100,000 of incremental U.S. deaths due to the pandemic remains unchanged at $70 million. Based on our updated outlook, our fourth quarter baseline includes a net mortality impact of $60 million due to COVID-19. The actual impact will depend on a variety of factors such as infection and fatality rates, geographic considerations and progress in testing and medical treatments. Also, we continue to expect incremental operating costs due to COVID-19 to be $5 million in the fourth quarter. This includes additional operating costs of $25 million, partially offset by $20 million of lower travel and entertainment expenses. 
Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain a robust capital position and adequate sources of funding. Our capital position exceeds our AA financial strength targets. And we have liquid assets at the parent company that are greater than 3x annual fixed charges, and we have substantial sources of funding. Our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Prudential Korea. And other sources of funds include free cash flow from our businesses and other contingent capital facilities. 
Turning to Slide 13 and in summary. During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute our strategic priorities for 2020. We have taken additional steps to expand our cost savings program. And we continue to benefit from the strength of our rock-solid balance sheet, which includes -- which gives us the confidence and flexibility to navigate the changes in this economic environment.

Now looking at the U.S. in terms of changing the focus within the business, we're on a path to derisking. And have made major pivots to less interest rate-sensitive and more capital-light solutions in our individual annuities and in our life business. And specifically you've seen us pivot away from the VAs with lifetime income guarantees to less market-sensitive products. And at the same time, you've seen us in our life business pivot to simpler non-guaranteed products. 
But what we've also said is that we want to accelerate the transformation. And I've said that we'll explore reinsurance and potentially the sale of certain blocks.

So repeating what Rob said, we're only about 3 weeks into the season, but we certainly see evidence that our investments are paying off and that we're having stronger performance than we had in 2019. Having said that, about 50% of industry-wide Medicare Advantage transactions occur in the last 2 weeks of the annual enrollment period, and that's the first 2 weeks of December.

We've had accelerating success. If you remember, there were sort of a couple of stages to what we were trying to accomplish.

We've -- what my word's, permissioned 12 million individuals that they can access, we get access to market our retail solutions. That is also ahead of our goals.

We have not seen an uptick in incidents in either our short-term disability business or our long-term disability business. That being said though, obviously we've operated this business for many, many decades, and we know that in recessionary environments, there's generally somewhere in the neighborhood of a year lag from when that incident shows up. So we have invested to make sure that our claims teams have low, what we call desk loads, so that if and when that incident starts to tick up, we're well prepared for it.

Well, as Rob noted in his remarks, with a significant decline in U.S. interest rates, we implemented pricing changes in August across all of our U.S. dollar products in Japan. As you know, it's common for salespeople to use such a pricing change to stimulate client contact. And that tends to accelerate sales from maybe the quarter ahead prior to such a change. Sales in 3Q also did benefit from the relaxation of social distancing requirements in Japan that were implemented in the beginning of June, and I think you also asked on that question. 
We expect that such enhanced demand will taper off in the following quarter, but then we are expecting things really to normalize as we head in to 2021. Overall our distribution in Japan is largely operating in kind of a back-to-normal mode, and I think that really reflects the strength of our differentiated business model."

It's more of a go-forward perspective if you think about the decision-making around our product pivot. We're working towards more of what I would frame as an all-weather portfolio, where we're taking less fully on ourselves the interest rate and equity market risk. HDI is our most sensitive product in that regard. 
So we think from a go-forward perspective, as you noted, we are very, very good in the annuity space. We believe there still is a deep-seated need to help people with accumulation and to help them with decumulation from a longevity insurance perspective. And we think our go-forward product portfolio does that, it does that well, but does it in a way that's more shareholder-friendly."
