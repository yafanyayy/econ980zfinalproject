Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. 
Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engage a new CGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium with the FDA focused on remediating the business. 
Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made the difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. 
As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers, but believe exiting the business is appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. 
Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. 
Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. 
At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. were increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty, strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position Amerisourcebergen to capitalize on market opportunities. 
AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income, our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, extended health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay, start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies, is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. 
World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world, operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. 
In addition, World Courier Nova technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials making treatments in patients home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. 
I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role in the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems, hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence, should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, Amerisourcebergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, Amerisourcebergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. 
More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"
24809,650357944,1896360,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAA",2065,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31,and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. 
As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. 
As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance; second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10% primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. 
Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison in the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. 
First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019; second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line at certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. 
In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete safe income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment and as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. 
Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. 
We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. This completes the review of our consolidated results. 
Now I will turn to our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution of specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. 
In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and Nova at World Courier. 
Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance, from a range of $7.3 to $7.6 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. 
We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. 
Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive, general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business as the right path forward from here. 
Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners, we have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services; and finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in Amerisourcebergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

Obviously, a disappointing day for ABC, but I think that Jim script was excellent. And by the way, I apologize to everyone. I think the quality of the sound is not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. So we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of -- a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we reached this decision, and we think that given -- with the businesses, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA. Throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1896360,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes, sure.

Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding had to do with guidance impact in other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call. What were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase. The benefit excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business, we're seeing good volume growth in the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance. And the impact that, that's happening on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about, but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503b legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high CGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were by far the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we do [indiscernible]. There's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to read scale. And these tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly like at least as far as the FDA expectations, too. 
So for ABC, which we have our purpose. We have our stakeholder value set, we just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding. I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system.

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they large, they're sophisticated and I think that there will be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you'd see some changes. You've seen very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement. So 
if there is international reference pricing. As we discussed in January. So I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that help the manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes people seem to take speaker prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged in this very passionate about it. I saw, the Head of our Government [indiscernible] today. We're talking about it. Barry, who heads up our physician services business is in Washington. Constantly, our business ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion. And we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of proper reimbursement."

And I tell you, we brought in people, especially to evaluate being a Cat provider, mainly to ensure that our customers would be able to carry on participating, and it was just -- it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don't believe it's very efficient. We've seen a so-called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven't worked. And you know the original cap program didn't work. So there's potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that. If there were to be a new type of a reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large, much more aggregated community oncologists, we look to work with them to provide solutions to payers and regulators."

I'm just trying to understand, is there -- has anything changed with respect to your assumptions around the core distribution business, because I just want to try to reconcile that versus the much stronger-than-expected first quarter, which seem to incorporate a bigger than expected loss from Pharmedium.

And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters, it's about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter. During the first quarter, 1 thing we benefited from its low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefit, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year. And so that was a favorable experience on debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost that is a benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year. And then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of 1 thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter we're expecting the growth in the second quarter to EPS growth to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year.

I think last year, we returned -- in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks, that's approximate numbers. And we like our financial flexibility. So our first option is to invest in the business, and we're bullish about projects like Fusion, for example. And we talked about the strong growth of Royal Korea, which in part is because of the Nova and the Cocoon investment. So those are good investments. And in a couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business investments. We remain interested in that. We are, of course, our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we're doing. So that's the first priority. We then -- we'd look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it's been really a sellers market. And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support. I think there could be talk in Japan, a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That worked out really, really well. There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, our expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful here. We increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about the returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense."

Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think 1 of the ways that I'm really proud, ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invest a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long-term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side.

And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers. I noted last quarter, we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna?

And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about -- asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks that the impact on PharMEDium. If we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year, in our adjusted results will be t $20 million adjusted operating loss.

What I want to just sort of dig in too quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction.

We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged a new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium, with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made a difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is the appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. We're increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty, strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers, and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income. Our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions, with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, extended health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay -- start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier's cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier Nova technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials, making treatments in patients home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role as the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care, and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems, hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends, with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"
24809,650357944,1896581,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAA",2065,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31, and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10%, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses, with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium's adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line at certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. 
In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete safe income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment and as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results, beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution of specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation, and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and Nova at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters, in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive, general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship, with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

And then you gave a lot of detail, Jim, around the change in the pharma segment guidance as far as the impact in the quarter and the balance of the year from PharMEDium.

Obviously, a disappointing day for ABC, but I think that Jim's script was excellent. And by the way, I apologize to everyone. I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of -- a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we have reached this decision, and we think that given where the business is, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We'd certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1896581,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure.

Sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding, it had to do with guidance impact in -- other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business. We're seeing good volume growth. In the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due to, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that, that's having on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

Eric, it's -- obviously, of course, we thought about our associates and our customers. And we -- unfortunately, since the closure of Memphis, we've never really been able to deliver the consistent customer experience that an AmerisourceBergen company would like to have. And there's a lot of reasons for it. And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503b legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were, by far, the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we just -- there are these -- there's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to read scale. And there's tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations out to go. 
So for ABC, which, we have our purpose. We have our stakeholder value set. We just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding. I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system. And again, we don't want to be in a business where we can't provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that's about all we can say there."

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they're large. They're sophisticated. And I think that there'll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you'd see some changes. You've seen very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement. So 
if it is international reference pricing, as we discussed it in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it'll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes, people tend to take [ stickier ] prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So a complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged and just very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs office yesterday. We're talking about it.

At the time, I think there was great anticipation that ABC, with our suite of businesses, would participate -- and actually, it was in 2000, so Bush's administration. But -- and there was no economically feasible way for us to participate. And I tell you, we brought in people, specially to evaluate being a cap provider, mainly to ensure that our customers would be able to carry on participating. And it was just -- it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don't believe it's very efficient. We've seen a so-called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven't worked. And you know, the original cap program didn't work. So there's potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that. If there were to be a new type of a reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to work -- move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large, much more aggregated community oncologists. We look to work with them to provide solutions to payers and regulators."

You seem to suggest that over the next 3 quarters, there'll be about a $35 million tailwind from eliminating the losses from PharMEDium, which, I understand the EPS impact, but if we could just look at it from an operating income perspective, that $35 million seems to be about a 2% tailwind, which seems like it would fully explain the change in your guidance from low to mid single, up to mid single? I'm just trying to understand, is there -- has anything changed with respect to your assumptions around the core distribution business? Because I just want to try to reconcile that versus the much stronger-than-expected first quarter, which seem to incorporate a bigger than expected loss from PharMEDium.

And as we look at guidance,",319,"Yes. And so I will cover that. And you're right. We indicated that PharMEDium is the $35 million tailwind year-over-year versus last year. And so that's kind of the benefit that we'll see year-over-year compared to last year. 
And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters is about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter, during the first quarter, one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year. And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year. And then also, the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of one thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter, we're expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth, to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there, Glen."

And how should we think about that going forward?"

I think last year, we returned -- in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks. And that's approximate numbers. And we liked our financial flexibility. So our first option is to invest in the business, and we're bullish about projects like Fusion, for example. And we talked about the strong growth of World Courier, which, in part, is because of the Nova and the Cocoon investment. So those are good investments. And in a couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business investments. We remain interested in that. 
We are, of course -- our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we're doing. So that's the first priority. We then -- we'd look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it's been really a sellers market. And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset, and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position, with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support, I think we could be talking to paying a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that, that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That's worked out really, really well. There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense."

The numbers are still small, but ABC has, we think, an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have, in -- particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to, to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think one of the ways that I'm really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invested a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long-term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we're seeing. And it's something that we monitor very, very closely and are staying close to as you would expect.

And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks, that the impact on PharMEDium, if we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year, in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss.

What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction?

So in a way, if you want to call it that. So no. It's not -- we don't feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms.

So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost 9 years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it's -- and it's been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity. So -- but I think it's incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged as, I think, Jim commented on so well in his remarks.

Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged a new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium, with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made a difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is the appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. for increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers, and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income. Our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions, with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, Xcenda's health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay -- start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier's Cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier's NOVA technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials, making treatments in patients home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role as the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care, and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions, and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends, with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"
24809,650357944,1898468,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAA",2069,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31, and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10%, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses, with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium's adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line as certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. 
In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete state income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment. And as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results, beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution -- specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation, and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and NOVA at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters, in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship, with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

And then you gave a lot of detail, Jim, around the change in the pharma segment guidance as far as the impact in the quarter and the balance of the year from PharMEDium. I guess maybe just to take a step back. Did any of your other assumptions change outside of the PharMEDium math you provided as far as thinking about 2Q through 4Q?"

Obviously, a disappointing day for ABC, but I think that Jim's script was excellent. And by the way, I apologize to everyone. I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we have reached this decision, and we think that given where the business is, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We'd certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1898468,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure.

Sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding, had to do with guidance impact in -- other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business. We're seeing good volume growth. In the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due to, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that that's having on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

And we -- unfortunately, since the closure of Memphis, we've never really been able to deliver the consistent customer experience that an AmerisourceBergen company would like to have. And there's a lot of reasons for it. And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503B legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were, by far, the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we just -- there are these -- there's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to reach scale. And there's tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations out to go. 
So for ABC, which, we have our purpose, we have our stakeholder value set, we just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding, I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system. And again, we don't want to be in a business where we can't provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that's about all we can say there."

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they're large. They're sophisticated. And I think that there'll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you're seeing some changes. You're seeing very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement.
So if it is international reference pricing, as we discussed it in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it'll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes, people tend to take thicker prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So a complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged and just very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs office yesterday. We're talking about it. Barry Fortner, who heads up our physician services business, is in Washington. Constantly, our business, ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion. And we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement."

We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that.

I appreciate all the detail. You seem to suggest that over the next 3 quarters, there'll be about a $35 million tailwind from eliminating the losses from PharMEDium, which, I understand the EPS impact, but if we could just look at it from an operating income perspective, that $35 million seems to be about a 2% tailwind, which seems like it would fully explain the change in your guidance from low to mid single, up to mid single? I'm just trying to understand, is there -- has anything changed with respect to your assumptions around the core distribution business? Because I just want to try to reconcile that versus the much stronger-than-expected first quarter, which seem to incorporate a bigger than expected loss from PharMEDium. So if you can just sort of reconcile those, that would be great."

We indicated that PharMEDium is the $35 million tailwind year-over-year versus last year. And so that's kind of the benefit that we'll see year-over-year compared to last year. And as we look at guidance,",319,"Yes. And so I will cover that. And you're right. We indicated that PharMEDium is the $35 million tailwind year-over-year versus last year. And so that's kind of the benefit that we'll see year-over-year compared to last year. 
And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters is about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter. During the first quarter, one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year.
And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year and then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of one thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter, we're expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth, to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there, Glen."

And how should we think about that going forward?"

I think last year, we returned -- in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks. And that's approximate numbers. And we liked our financial flexibility. So our first option is to invest in the business, and we're bullish about projects like Fusion, for example. And we talked about the strong growth of World Courier, which, in part, is because of the NOVA and the Cocoon investment. So those are good investments. And in -- a couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business investments. We remain interested in that. 
We are, of course -- our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we're doing. So that's the first priority. We then -- we'd look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it's been really a sellers market. And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset, and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position, with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support, I think we could be talking to paying a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That's worked out really, really well. There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense."

I think we talked about at the end of fiscal '19 just how the growth exceed our expectations. But I would say that, that trend continues. The numbers are still small, but ABC has, we think, an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have, in -- particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to, to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think one of the ways that I'm really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invested a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long-term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we're seeing. And it's something that we monitor very, very closely and are staying close to as you would expect. We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years. So thanks for the question."

And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers? I know that last quarter, we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna.

And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks, that the impact on PharMEDium, if we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss.

So I'm guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably not $0. What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction?

So in a way, if you want to call it that. So no. It's not -- we don't feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms. In relative terms, it's relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day in sales. It's not that much, and some of it is out the country. And it is a tremendous seasonality in our business as well. So we like being in a strong cash position. But again, we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that may be in the marketplace. 
So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost 9 years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it's -- and it's been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity. So -- but I think it's incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged as, I think, Jim commented on so well in his remarks. So as we stand here today, commercially, we have extremely strong customer relationships, partnerships and leadership in key markets and services. Culturally, we are a purpose-driven organization that feels united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged a new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium, with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made a difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is the appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. for increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers, and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income. Our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions, with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, Xcenda's health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay -- start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier's Cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier's NOVA technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials, making treatments in patients' home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role as the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care, and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions, and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends, with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"
24809,650357944,1899768,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAA",2067,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31, and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10%, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses, with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium's adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line as certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete state income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment. And as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results, beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution -- specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation, and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and NOVA at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid-single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters, in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship, with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

And then you gave a lot of detail, Jim, around the change in the pharma segment guidance as far as the impact in the quarter and the balance of the year from PharMEDium. I guess maybe just to take a step back. Did any of your other assumptions change outside of the PharMEDium math you provided as far as thinking about 2Q through 4Q?"

Obviously, a disappointing day for ABC, but I think that Jim's script was excellent. And by the way, I apologize to everyone. I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we have reached this decision, and we think that given where the business is, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We'd certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1899768,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure.

Sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding, had to do with guidance impact in -- other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business. We're seeing good volume growth. In the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due to, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that that's having on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

Eric, it's -- obviously, of course, we thought about our associates and our customers. And we -- unfortunately, since the closure of Memphis, we've never really been able to deliver the consistent customer experience that an AmerisourceBergen company would like to have. And there's a lot of reasons for it. And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503B legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were, by far, the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we just -- there are these -- there's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to reach scale. And there's tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations out to go. 
So for ABC, which, we have our purpose, we have our stakeholder value set, we just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding, I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system. And again, we don't want to be in a business where we can't provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that's about all we can say there."

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they're large. They're sophisticated. And I think that there'll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you're seeing some changes. You're seeing very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement.
So if it is international reference pricing, as we discussed it in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it'll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes, people tend to take thicker prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So a complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged and just very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs office yesterday. We're talking about it. Barry Fortner, who heads up our physician services business, is in Washington. Constantly, our business, ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion. And we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement."

And it was just -- it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don't believe it's very efficient. We've seen a so-called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven't worked. And you know, the original cap program didn't work. So there's potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that. If there were to be a new type of a reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large, much more aggregated community oncologists.

And so that's kind of the benefit that we'll see year-over-year compared to last year. 
And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters is about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter. During the first quarter, one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year.
And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year and then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of one thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter, we're expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth, to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there, Glen."

Based on your free cash flow assumptions, you're going to be cash -- have positive cash on the balance sheet here in the next 2 to 3 quarters. And so I'm just kind of wondering with PharMEDium now in the rearview mirror, has any -- have your thoughts changed at all with respect to the balance sheet or capital deployment priorities? And how should we think about that going forward?"

I think last year, we returned -- in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks. And that's approximate numbers. And we",386,"No. We've had a very consistent capital deployment strategy. I think last year, we returned -- in fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, of which was approximately 30% dividend, 70% share buybacks. And that's approximate numbers. And we liked our financial flexibility. So our first option is to invest in the business, and we're bullish about projects like Fusion, for example. And we talked about the strong growth of World Courier, which, in part, is because of the NOVA and the Cocoon investment. So those are good investments. And in -- a couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business investments. We remain interested in that. 
We are, of course -- our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we're doing. So that's the first priority. We then -- we'd look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it's been really a sellers market. And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset, and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position, with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support, I think we could be talking to paying a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That's worked out really, really well. 
There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense."

I think we talked about at the end of fiscal '19 just how the growth exceed our expectations. But I would say that, that trend continues. The numbers are still small, but ABC has, we think, an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have, in -- particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to, to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think one of the ways that I'm really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invested a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we're seeing. And it's something that we monitor very, very closely and are staying close to as you would expect. We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years. So thanks for the question."

And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers? I know that last quarter, we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna. Or anything else that you're seeing in the marketplace, maybe on the specialty side that you can provide color on that drives the acceleration for the rest of the year?"

We're seeing particularly strong growth in specialty distribution but really broad-based growth in many parts of business.

And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks, that the impact on PharMEDium, if we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss. And so if we look year-over-year, it is a $35 million tailwind to the business.

So I'm guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably not $0. What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction? I'm just trying to better understand what was the financial hurdle on the sale versus shutdown decision that was probably something well above $0.

So in a way, if you want to call it that. So no. It's not -- we don't feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms. In relative terms, it's relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day in sales. It's not that much, and some of it is out the country. And it is a tremendous seasonality in our business as well. So we like being in a strong cash position. But again, we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that may be in the marketplace. 
So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost 9 years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it's -- and it's been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity. So -- but I think it's incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged as, I think, Jim commented on so well in his remarks. So as we stand here today, commercially, we have extremely strong customer relationships, partnerships and leadership in key markets and services. Culturally, we are a purpose-driven organization that feels united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. And AmerisourceBergen, I can assure you, is focused on creating long-term growth and value for all its stakeholders. And again, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. Have a good day.

Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged a new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium, with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made a difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is the appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. for increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers, and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income. Our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions, with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, Xcenda's health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay -- start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier's Cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier's NOVA technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials, making treatments in patients' home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role as the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care, and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions, and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends, with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31, and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10%, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses, with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium's adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line as certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete state income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment. And as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results, beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution -- specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation, and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and NOVA at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid-single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters, in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship, with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we have reached this decision, and we think that given where the business is, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We'd certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1899769,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure.

Sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding, had to do with guidance impact in -- other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business. We're seeing good volume growth. In the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due to, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that that's having on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

And there's a lot of reasons for it. And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503B legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were, by far, the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we just -- there are these -- there's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to reach scale. And there's tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations out to go. 
So for ABC, which, we have our purpose, we have our stakeholder value set, we just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding, I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system. And again, we don't want to be in a business where we can't provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that's about all we can say there."

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they're large. They're sophisticated. And I think that there'll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you're seeing some changes. You're seeing very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement.
So if it is international reference pricing, as we discussed it in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it'll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes, people tend to take thicker prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So a complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged and just very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs office yesterday. We're talking about it. Barry Fortner, who heads up our physician services business, is in Washington. Constantly, our business, ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion. And we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement."

And it was just -- it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don't believe it's very efficient. We've seen a so-called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven't worked. And you know, the original cap program didn't work. So there's potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that. If there were to be a new type of a reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large, much more aggregated community oncologists.

And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters is about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter. During the first quarter, one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year.
And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year and then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of one thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter, we're expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth, to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there, Glen."

And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset, and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position, with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support, I think we could be talking to paying a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That's worked out really, really well. 
There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders. So I hope that makes sense."

I think we talked about at the end of fiscal '19 just how the growth exceed our expectations. But I would say that, that trend continues. The numbers are still small, but ABC has, we think, an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have, in -- particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to, to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think one of the ways that I'm really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invested a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we're seeing. And it's something that we monitor very, very closely and are staying close to as you would expect. We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years. So thanks for the question."

So that's on them? 
And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers? I know that last quarter, we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna. Or anything else that you're seeing in the marketplace, maybe on the specialty side that you can provide color on that drives the acceleration for the rest of the year?"

And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks, that the impact on PharMEDium, if we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss. And so if we look year-over-year, it is a $35 million tailwind to the business.

So I'm guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably not $0. What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction? I'm just trying to better understand what was the financial hurdle on the sale versus shutdown decision that was probably something well above $0.

So that's -- again, that's the proposed framework, but that's the sort of framework that we'd be interested in. So it's a sort of -- have really played it out over the long term, which also has the benefit of providing consistent support for the patient services that we think will be needed to, to transition population health management for this crisis. So in a way, if you want to call it that. So no. It's not -- we don't feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms. In relative terms, it's relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day in sales. It's not that much, and some of it is out the country. And it is a tremendous seasonality in our business as well. So we like being in a strong cash position. But again, we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that may be in the marketplace. 
So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost 9 years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it's -- and it's been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity. So -- but I think it's incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged as, I think, Jim commented on so well in his remarks. So as we stand here today, commercially, we have extremely strong customer relationships, partnerships and leadership in key markets and services. Culturally, we are a purpose-driven organization that feels united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. And AmerisourceBergen, I can assure you, is focused on creating long-term growth and value for all its stakeholders. And again, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. Have a good day.

Today, I am pleased to discuss AmerisourceBergen's strong fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We delivered solid performance across both the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health groups, each delivering year-over-year growth in the first quarter. 
Revenues were up 5% to $48 billion for the quarter and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.76 for the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year period. Before we provide more details on our first quarter results, I want to take a few moments to discuss the ongoing opioid litigation and the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. AmerisourceBergen and the other parties continue the complex process of working towards a global resolution of the opioid litigation, while also continuing to prepare for upcoming trials. We are hopeful that the necessary parties understand and see the merits of the global framework as a practical path for global resolution. 
As we engage in discussions related to the global framework and continue to litigate, we are unable to comment deeply on these matters at this time. AmerisourceBergen remains committed to transparency and providing shareholders with updates as we are able. 
Moving on to PharMEDium. At this point last year, we detailed how we had begun a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium and engaged a new cGMP expert consulting firm to work with the business' new seasoned leadership team. As we stated at that time, we entered this review phase with a focus on pursuing a thoughtful and decisive course of action that was best for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders, while respecting both the needs of our customers and other stakeholders. 
Over the past year, we worked internally to optimize the business, continued discussions with regulators and reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree for PharMEDium, with the FDA focused on remediating the business. Despite this progress, we still face considerable challenges in order to successfully move the business forward, including ongoing regulatory challenges, continued operational issues, inability to make sufficient progress on remediation and the continued financial burden of running the business. 
Given these factors, we've made a difficult decision to shut down and exit the PharMEDium business. The decision is a difficult one, and we are mindful of the impact it has on our associates and customers. We want to thank all PharMEDium associates for their dedication, and we are appreciative of their efforts. As part of the shutdown process, we will provide impacted associates with the support and services they need. We are also disappointed that PharMEDium will no longer be able to serve its customers but believe exiting the business is the appropriate path forward for AmerisourceBergen and its shareholders. Jim will provide financial details, including the decision's impact on fiscal 2020 guidance later in the call. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. AmerisourceBergen continues to benefit from our unique pharmaceutical center strategy that positions us well within the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's core strength and capabilities regarding our unrivaled talent, expertise and ability to provide comprehensive solutions continues to differentiate us from our peers. I want to thank our associates for their dedication, executional excellence and focus on consistently creating and delivering value for all of our stakeholders. I am proud to work alongside our teams who remain relentless in their pursuit of opportunities to unlock value for pharmaceutical manufacturers, health care providers and the patients they serve. 
Within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the segment's success reflects this continued focus on customer experience, in addition to our ongoing strength in specialty distribution and overall growth in customer volumes. AmerisourceBergen is the leader in specialty distribution, and our strong growth continues to be fueled by our deep expertise and key customer relationships, on organically growing market with favorable demographics and increased pharmaceutical utilization, resulting from innovation within specialty, particularly in the areas of oncology, ophthalmology and rheumatology. In these and other therapeutic categories, AmerisourceBergen continues to deliver value and provide differentiated services and solutions to key customer segments, such as our community physician practice partners. A key differentiator for our specialty business, our ION GPO remains a competitive advantage in our suite of offerings to oncology physician practices. 
As the market-leading GPO for community oncologists, ION provides physicians with the contracting, analytics and business practice solutions they need to run their practices more efficiently and profitably. At the same time, we continue to see positive early signs for biosimilar utilization. We believe that the right conditions exist in the U.S. for increasing biosimilar commercialization success. We continue to see signs that legislated and commercial plans are recognizing the potential of biosimilars to create better access and affordability for patients. AmerisourceBergen's market-leading position in specialty strongly positions us to benefit from biosimilars. We've aligned ourselves with key customers, and biosimilar manufacturers understand the value of contracting with ION as they seek to increase utilization of their products. 
These elements, combined with our scale, efficiency, state-of-the-art distribution network and competitive sourcing capabilities position AmerisourceBergen to capitalize on market opportunities. AmerisourceBergen is also well positioned to seize market opportunities in animal health and pharmaceutical manufacturer services through our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group, businesses that comprise approximately 20% of AmerisourceBergen's operating income. Our largest business in this segment, MWI, is a market leader in animal health solutions, with the right strategic partnerships and capabilities to enhance operational efficiencies and deliver strong customer experience while our portfolio of global commercialization services strengthens health outcomes by supporting pharmaceutical innovation with data-driven solutions that advance and support patient access and adherence through therapy. 
For example, Xcenda's health economics consulting and field tech team reimbursement support services are helping manufacturers maximize market access for products while the Lash Group's technology-enabled patient access and adherence solutions are helping to reduce barriers for patients to stay -- start and stay on therapy. 
Essential to pharmaceutical manufacturers' ability to commercialize and improve access to innovative therapies is ability to transport trial products and unique patient treatment like cell and gene therapies on time and at the right temperature. World Courier, the global market leader in specialty and clinical trial logistics, is a trusted solutions partner that services these complex needs for manufacturers around the world. Operating in over 50 countries, this highly differentiated and innovative business continues to grow and expand. This business delivered unparalleled service offerings for its pharmaceutical partners in clinical trial logistics and commercial services. 
For example, World Courier's Cocoon offering is the industry's most dependable and cost-effective refrigerated container solution, providing unprecedented reliability and driving strong momentum for the business this year. In addition, World Courier's NOVA technology platform further improves operational excellence, scaling to meet the demand and complex requirements of our global customers. 
Looking ahead, World Courier will continue to design and deploy patient-centric and forward-thinking transport services in new areas like in home clinical trials, making treatments in patients' home possible in virtually every therapeutic area. I am proud of AmerisourceBergen's role as the global health care solutions leader and purpose-driven organization. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and recognize that there is always a patient connected to every product. Pharmaceutical care is still the most efficient form of health care, and medication adherence provides positive health benefits for patients while saving lives and the health care systems hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Adherence should be the goal for which all health care stakeholders are striving. As an enabler of access and creator of additional efficiencies, AmerisourceBergen will continue to engage in constructive dialogue around benefit design and rising out-of-pocket costs for patients and the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system. 
As a leader in the health care supply chain, AmerisourceBergen remains well positioned to create sustained long-term value. Execution of our 4 key strategic pillars, strong customer base, leadership in specialty distribution and services, innovative services and solutions, and proven corporate stewardship, positions us well to benefit from market trends, with an evolving market landscape. 
As we move further into fiscal 2020, we will continue to advance our talent and culture and execute on our unique and differentiated business strategy. More than ever, we remain confident in our growth strategy, focused on execution and dedicated to delivering long-term value for our associates, shareholders, partners, customers and the patients they serve. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I will now turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our first quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAA",2067,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus primarily on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year December quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As Steve mentioned, we had a strong quarter with solid execution in our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment and continued growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group. 
Before I discuss our results in greater detail this morning, I want to take a moment to discuss the GAAP asset impairment charge that we took for PharMEDium as of December 31, and the January strategic decision to exit the business. 
First, the GAAP asset impairment for PharMEDium. We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of December 31 and made the determination that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicated that the assets should have a lower carrying value. As a result, we calculated the fair value of PharMEDium's long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flow estimates as of December 31, and determine the asset impairment amount to be $138 million. 
Second, I'll cover the decision to exit the PharMEDium business. As Steve said, the company has decided to exit the compounding business. And as a result, we'll see sole commercial and administrative operations related to the business. The decision to exit the PharMEDium business was not easy, but it is undoubtedly the right path forward for AmerisourceBergen and our shareholders. As Steve noted, the decision was based on a number of factors, notably continuing regulatory and operational challenges, including PharMEDium's decision earlier this month to suspend production at its New Jersey facility. 
In addition to the December quarter impairment charge as a result of the decision in January to exit the business, the company expects to impair the majority of the remaining $55 million of tangible PharMEDium assets and all of the remaining $185 million of PharMEDium intangible assets in the March quarter. 
Finally, as a result of the exit, we expect to claim an ordinary income tax deduction and estimate that we will realize a cash tax benefit in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, totaling approximately $500 million to $600 million. This will benefit our GAAP P&L and GAAP tax rate but will not impact our adjusted tax rate. However, it will have a positive impact on cash flows in the years in which the benefit is realized. 
As it pertains to the adjusted non-GAAP results for the remainder of the year, our decision to exit PharMEDium will have a positive impact on our outlook for fiscal 2020, which I will provide greater detail on in a few minutes. 
Turning now to our first quarter results. I'll provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance. Second, I will cover our increased fiscal 2020 guidance, reflecting the continued strength of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, a lower share count and the removal of PharMEDium for the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2020. 
We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.76, an increase of 10%, primarily due to higher operating income and a lower share count. Lower net interest expense was offset by an increase in income taxes. Also, our December quarter of last year had unfavorable bad debt expense, which benefits the current year-over-year comparison by a couple of pennies. 
Our consolidated revenue was $47.9 billion, up 5%, driven by strong revenue growth in both segments. Gross profit increased 3% or $40 million to $1.24 billion. 
Consolidated operating expenses increased 2% to $748 million. This quarter is an easier comparison on the balance of fiscal 2020, due to a few reasons that we have called out previously. First, we had not yet lapped the health care benefit design change that was implemented for calendar 2019. Second, much of the operational synergies related to our fiscal 2018 acquisition of HD Smith were captured after the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, we executed on delivering better-than-expected expense management across the business in the quarter, most notably within the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. 
Consolidated operating income was $495 million, up 5%, with our operating margin down 1 basis point. As I mentioned earlier, there were some favorable items related to bad debt expense comparison, health care and the timing of HD Smith synergy capture. Our businesses, with the exception of PharMEDium, are executing well, and the strength of our business continues to show through in our financial results as we posted another solid quarter of growth in operating income. 
As it pertains to PharMEDium, since the decision to exit the business was made in January, PharMEDium's adjusted operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 will remain in our full year fiscal 2020 results. The adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in the first quarter was $20 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $14 million in the first quarter fiscal 2019. 
Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense decreased 26% to $31 million. As a reminder, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 has a favorable impact on the interest expense line as certain build-to-suit leases that were previously accounted for as finance leases are being accounted for as operating leases, resulting in an offsetting unfavorable impact on operating expenses and, therefore, operating income. In addition to the lower interest expense, we continue to benefit from interest income related to our higher average invested cash balance. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21%, up from 19.9% in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a discrete state income tax item. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207.5 million shares. In the December quarter, we used opportunistic share repurchases to return $135 million of capital to our shareholders. While on the topic of returning capital to shareholders, this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. AmerisourceBergen has a balanced approach to capital deployment. And as evidenced by share repurchases and dividend increase, we have exhibited our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, in the December quarter, we had free cash flow of $76 million as we experienced normal seasonality in the business and remain on track for hitting our adjusted free cash flow guidance. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $134 million. As a reminder, the company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding significant unpredictable or nonrecurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash, of which $1.1 billion was held offshore and the majority was U.S. denominated cash. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I will turn to our segment results, beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $46 billion, up 5% as the segment continues to benefit from continued strength in the specialty distribution -- specialty products in multiple channels and the growth of our customers overall. Our segment operating income increased 5% to $392 million. We continue to be encouraged by our team's ability to execute and deliver value for our partners, both upstream and down, particularly in our specialty physician services group. 
As I mentioned earlier, the segment did benefit from favorable bad debt expense compared to the previous year quarter as well as the year-over-year comparison of no longer operating the HD Smith distribution centers that we began transitioning to our existing distribution network in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, revenue was $1.8 billion, up 10% driven by 8% growth for MWI and double-digit growth in Global Commercialization Services. 
From an operating income standpoint, this group had operating income of $104 million, up 6% driven by growth in Consulting and World Courier. 
The group is off to a solid start, and we are encouraged by the growth expectations for the business this year. The Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Group is a positive differentiator for AmerisourceBergen. 
As we look out into the future, we are focused on being leaders in providing key manufacturer services to support pharmaceutical innovation, and we are investing to fortify our strength and overall value proposition through projects like Fusion at LASH and NOVA at World Courier. Additionally, MWI has continued to strengthen its customer relationships and commercial partnerships and is focused on execution to further enhance efficiency. 
This completes the review of our segment results. Let me now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance from a range of $7.30 to $7.60 to an updated range of $7.55 to $7.80, which implies EPS growth of 6% to 10% and reflects the company's continued strong performance, opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter and our exit of the PharMEDium business, which represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. 
Regarding operating income, we now expect to grow consolidated operating income in the mid-single-digit percent range to reflect the continued strength of our overall business and the year-over-year favorability of not having PharMEDium losses in our adjusted operating income results for the balance of the year. We now expect the operating income in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. 
As a result of exiting the PharMEDium business, our fiscal second, third and fourth quarters will have a favorable comparison to the respective fiscal 2019 quarters, in which we recorded adjusted PharMEDium operating losses of $14 million, $9 million and $18 million, respectively. 
In total, the fiscal 2020 adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium is solely what we recorded in Q1, $20 million. The total adjusted operating loss from PharMEDium in fiscal 2019 was $55 million. Therefore, the exit of PharMEDium results in fiscal 2020 operating income tailwind of $35 million versus the prior year. Since we will not be revising our previously reported adjusted non-GAAP operating results, we are providing this additional level of detail as part of our focus on being as transparent as possible on the financial impact of the PharMEDium exit and providing key information for your modeling purposes. 
Regarding share repurchases, given the level of share repurchases in the December quarter, we now expect to finish the year around 208 million weighted average shares outstanding. 
Lastly, while we do not have specific guidance metrics, broadly speaking, both brand and generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. 
Regarding our fiscal second quarter EPS expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, I will note that our second quarter EPS growth is likely to be at the low end of the 6% to 10% EPS guidance growth range for the year as we expect an increase in our operating expense growth in the quarter. 
On our second quarter call last year, I noted that there were some positive general and administrative expense items that benefited that quarter. We do not expect those items to repeat in 2020. 
In closing, regarding PharMEDium, our review has been both thoughtful and decisive, but there comes a point in time where you have to make a decision that the path you have been on is no longer appropriate and our decision to exit the business is the right path forward from here. Despite this strategic change, the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen remain unchanged. 
We have strong customer relationships in each customer segment. Our businesses are focused on execution and bringing innovative services and solutions to our partners. We have leadership in key specialty markets, notably specialty distribution and commercialization services. And finally, AmerisourceBergen is purpose-driven and focused on creating shareholder value through thoughtful corporate stewardship, with a balanced and strategic approach to capital allocation and a clear emphasis on advancing our talent and culture. AmerisourceBergen is executing very well across the business. Our value proposition to our partners is undeniable, and we are well positioned to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back to the operator to start our Q&A."

I think the quality of the sound was not quite what we would hope, and we'll endeavor to do better next time. But I think Jim's comments were excellent. You can see from the financial disclosures, we've displayed a lot of perseverance with this business. And it's just -- I think the 503B changes have made it very difficult to scale the business and get to the sort of consistent quality that we, AmerisourceBergen, would like to deliver to our customers. And we've continued to experience ongoing regulatory challenges and challenges with the remediation program we put in place. We announced on this call that our New Jersey facility recently had a close. And so we really went into this year with an attitude of wanting to protect our profits for our shareholders and other stakeholders. And we had a lot of, I think, perseverance with this business. And I think that we have reached this decision, and we think that given where the business is, it would be very difficult to enter into a sales process. We have certainly been in close communication with the FDA throughout the consent decree negotiation and the consent decree implementation. We think that we've approached this as a good stakeholder. We'd certainly regard regulators as a stakeholder. And we'll work collaboratively and transparently with them and professionally with them through the closure. Jim, you want to answer the second part of the question?"
24809,650357944,1901020,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure.

Sure. Bob, the second part of the question, my understanding, had to do with guidance impact in -- other than PharMEDium, which I really went into a lot of detail on in the call, what were the other things that impacted guidance, particularly as it relates to our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And as I said during my prepared remarks, if you look at our increase in guidance, the exit of the PharMEDium business represents slightly less than half of the guidance increase. And so if you look at the $0.20 increase in guidance at the top end of the range, the exit of PharMEDium represents slightly less than half the guidance increase, the benefit of excluding those losses in Q2 through Q4. 
And so that means that the rest of the business is performing quite well, and we are seeing really good performance in the core Pharma Distribution business. As we've talked about, we're seeing a lot of strength in specialty distribution, in particular, our specialty physician services business. We're seeing good volume growth. In the Pharma Distribution business, we're seeing 5% volume growth. That's due to, of course, our balanced portfolio of customers. And so we really feel good about our Q1 performance and the impact that that's having on our full year guidance. And of course, it relates to our Pharma Distribution business you asked about but also good volumes and good performance in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business, which had 10% revenue growth in the quarter end. So that positively impacts our fiscal year guidance also, Bob."

And there's a lot of reasons for it. And in the 6 years since the passage of the 503B legislation, I think there was a really strong expectation to move to a very high cGMP standard immediately. And as you pointed out correctly, we were, by far, the largest. So I think having that leadership position, there were very high expectations put on us. And I think we really, along with some talented associates, dedicated associates and some new leadership team, some new outside experts, we really did a tremendous effort to meet the high bar. But there's a lot of -- we just -- there are these -- there's a lot of powder products in the marketplace. It's hard to reach scale. And there's tremendous consequences if something doesn't go -- if something goes badly, like at least as far as the FDA expectations out to go. 
So for ABC, which, we have our purpose, we have our stakeholder value set, we just made the decision that this is not a business that really fits into our portfolio. Our customers have been understanding, I think somewhat disappointed, but I think it reflects the reality of where we are with regulators, where we are with the powder products in this market, where we are with the economics in the overall health system. And again, we don't want to be in a business where we can't provide a very reliable exceptional efficient service. So I think that's about all we can say there."

Our #1 concern is physician reimbursement and making sure that those community sites can continue to serve patients in the community setting. Manufacturers are obviously another key stakeholder, but they're large. They're sophisticated. And I think that there'll be some very legitimate conversations. And in fact, often, when these conversations start, actions change in the marketplace in anticipation of those changes. And I think you're seeing some changes. You're seeing very moderate inflation. In fact, on the Part B products, there's always been moderate inflation because of the ASP reimbursement.
So if it is international reference pricing, as we discussed it in January, so I hope that it will be a thoughtful transition that it'll give manufacturers time to adjust. I think that a lot of the noise is not actually factual. The price differentials are not quite as high as one would have you believe. And sometimes, people tend to take thicker prices, and there are a lot of things that go behind our wholesale acquisition cost and ASP with commercial payers that aren't always recognized. And one thing as well with government and single-payer systems, the price gets negotiated upfront, and then there's no changes. So that's one of the nuances that are different in the U.S. system. 
So a complex topic. You can hear that even at the CFO level, I'm very engaged and just very passionate about it. I saw the Head of our Government Affairs office yesterday. We're talking about it. Barry Fortner, who heads up our physician services business, is in Washington. Constantly, our business, ION, as you can imagine, is very involved with practice management. So we are going to be a part of the discussion. And we look forward to participating in any changes and hope that they are sensible and logical in the context of Part B reimbursement."

And it was just -- it was impossible to make the numbers work. We don't believe it's very efficient. We've seen a so-called white bagging and brown bagging programs, try to be implemented by different payers, more on the commercial side, and they just haven't worked. And you know, the original cap program didn't work. So there's potential wastage with these programs. We believe that the current system works very well with oncologists having the financial responsibility for the preparation of the infusions. And we'll carry on assisting with that. If there were to be a new type of a reimbursement and there was differentiated reimbursement or some sort of encouragement to move more towards the cap program, we would look to work with what are some very large, much more aggregated community oncologists.

And as we look at guidance, as I said before, taking PharMEDium out of the last 3 quarters is about half the increase to guidance. And we are seeing strength throughout the businesses. Of course, guidance is a range. So going from low- to mid-single digits, PharMEDium is a big part of that. But we're also seeing strength throughout the businesses that's impacting our guidance increase also. And it's pretty broad-based. We talked about specialty physician services, but we're seeing strength throughout the business. One thing that I'll mention, as you talked about the first quarter. During the first quarter, one thing we benefited from is low growth in operating expenses. Our operating expenses grew 2% during the first quarter, and that included some year-over-year benefits, which we don't expect to continue through the rest of the year.
And so that was a favorable experience on that debt expense, favorable experience on our internal health care cost due to the benefit design change in calendar year 2019 that we were still benefiting from year-over-year and then also the operational synergies related to consolidating the HD Smith distribution centers. And so that's kind of one thing, which benefited the first quarter, which doesn't continue for the rest of the year. And then as we said, the second quarter, we're expecting the growth in the second quarter, the EPS growth, to be at the lower end of our 6% to 10% EPS growth range because last year, we had particularly favorable operating expense experience in the second quarter, which we are expecting to repeat in the second quarter of this year. And so I think that gives you some additional color there, Glen."

And we talked about the strong growth of World Courier, which, in part, is because of the NOVA and the Cocoon investment. So those are good investments. And in -- a couple of years ago, we were making tremendous investments with ABC order and the distribution network. So those are very good examples of core business investments. We remain interested in that. 
We are, of course -- our replenishment center in Ohio is a good example of another core investment that we're doing. So that's the first priority. We then -- we'd look at the right sort of acquisitions. Unfortunately, it's been really a sellers market. And the quality of -- I think if we found really the right asset, and the management team was convinced that we had a company with a leadership position, with the right sort of a fit for our customers and the patients and physicians that we support, I think we could be talking to paying a lot -- significantly more than our multiple because we understand that that's probably -- it's what's required in this market. But we really haven't seen the sort of asset that motivates us. It's about 2 years ago since we acquired HD Smith. It was close to $1 billion. That's worked out really, really well. 
There's not really opportunities on the regional side. So we just haven't seen great opportunities. I think you know where we invested is in the commercialization services, expansion of the MWR business. That would be something we're very interested in. We've made a couple more investments in our Brazil and Canadian businesses, where we have solid presences, management teams that we can invest behind. So those are things. And then, of course, we'll continue to be very thoughtful where we increased our dividend, we announced this morning. So you'll continue to see us be very thoughtful about returns to shareholders.

I think we talked about at the end of fiscal '19 just how the growth exceed our expectations. But I would say that, that trend continues. The numbers are still small, but ABC has, we think, an important place to play in adoption of biosimilars with the market presence we have, in -- particularly in oncology and other specialty markets. Diabetes is a very important market for our good neighbor pharmacy customers because those sort of complex chronic conditions are exactly what we think community pharmacy is very well set up to, to play a role in. So definitely, we'd be interested. 
I think one of the ways that I'm really proud ABC has developed is on our sourcing side. We have, I'd say, over the last decade or so since I moved up here, we really invested a lot of resources there. We have very proficient people on the manufacturing side that really are working, I think, very competently and positioning us well for the long term to be the key player in biosimilar adoption, particularly on the injectable and infusible side. So we like what we're seeing. And it's something that we monitor very, very closely and are staying close to as you would expect. We regard it as one of the key opportunities that ABC has for the next couple of years. So thanks for the question."

So on the PharMEDium side, if we think about PharMEDium from a pro forma basis and we just kind of like exclude the losses that you incurred from them last year, what would be the pro forma EBIT growth for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment? So that's on them? 
And then secondly, if we think about kind of like your guidance for the remainder of the year, it seems that the top line guidance seems to be skewed toward an acceleration 2Q to 4Q, if you think about the midpoint from what you reported in the first quarter. So where are you seeing that incremental growth coming from? Is it additional volume coming from existing customers? I know that last quarter, we talked about the potential of gaining more business from Cigna. Or anything else that you're seeing in the marketplace, maybe on the specialty side that you can provide color on that drives the acceleration for the rest of the year?"

We're seeing particularly strong growth in specialty distribution but really broad-based growth in many parts of business. We have called out the Cigna volume being added to Express Scripts, which is -- we indicated that, that is approximately 1/4 of our revenue growth. And while it's inherently lower-margin business, it is positive for growing revenue and operating income dollars, but we're seeing growth in several businesses. And as you noted, we're seeing particularly good growth in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health business. 
And then you asked about growth if we exclude PharMEDium. And I think we've provided, Ricky, really good detail on that in our prepared remarks, that the impact on PharMEDium, if we're looking year-over-year, is a $55 million adjusted operating loss last year and this year in our adjusted results will be $20 million adjusted operating loss. And so if we look year-over-year, it is a $35 million tailwind to the business. But we are seeing, excluding that, good growth throughout our various businesses, in particular, our specialty distribution business, but throughout the business."

So I'm guessing that the private transaction value of PharMEDium today is probably not $0. What I want to just sort of dig into quickly here is just, generally speaking, should we conclude that the cash tax benefits of $500 million to $600 million that ABC is receiving from shutting it down, does that outweigh the benefits of any after-tax proceeds you might have received in a sale transaction? Or would you have gotten or received those cash tax benefits, even in a low price sales transaction? I'm just trying to better understand what was the financial hurdle on the sale versus shutdown decision that was probably something well above $0. So I just want to understand that a little bit better."

So that's -- again, that's the proposed framework, but that's the sort of framework that we'd be interested in. So it's a sort of -- have really played it out over the long term, which also has the benefit of providing consistent support for the patient services that we think will be needed to, to transition population health management for this crisis. So in a way, if you want to call it that. So no. It's not -- we don't feel the need at all. It is a lot of cash in absolute terms. In relative terms, it's relative to a couple of hundred million dollars a day in sales. It's not that much, and some of it is out the country. And it is a tremendous seasonality in our business as well. So we like being in a strong cash position. But again, we are mindful of fair returns to our shareholders and the internal and external opportunities that may be in the marketplace. 
So with that, I think we are going to close this first quarter call, and we appreciate your interest in AmerisourceBergen. I must say that this is probably the most difficult decision that we have made since I became CEO almost 9 years ago, and the management team has really tried to persevere with this business, but it's -- and it's been a very difficult decision. And we are, of course, especially conscious of the impact on our customers and our associates who we are committed to treating with the utmost respect and transparency and dignity. So -- but I think it's incumbent on us to talk about the key strengths and the key differentiators of AmerisourceBergen, which remain unchanged as, I think, Jim commented on so well in his remarks. So as we stand here today, commercially, we have extremely strong customer relationships, partnerships and leadership in key markets and services. Culturally, we are a purpose-driven organization that feels united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. And AmerisourceBergen, I can assure you, is focused on creating long-term growth and value for all its stakeholders. And again, we thank you for your time and attention this morning. Have a good day.

As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us,",1506,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us, I will focus this morning's call on 2 main areas. First, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and second, we will talk about how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long-term for our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and our communities. Jim will then discuss our results in more detail and our outlook for the remainder of the year. First, with regard to the actions we have taken in response to the COVID 2019 dynamic. I've never been prouder of  AmerisourceBergen and our associates. We have been guided by our purpose and values, and the company has prioritized supporting the safety of our associates. In turn, our associates have been innovating in helping our manufacturer and provider customers navigate new or intensified challenges. The health, safety and well-being of our associates is paramount, and we have taken several steps to support our frontline associates, which have included enhanced cleaning protocols and additional support from third-party cleaners, enhanced pay time for associates leading to quarantine careful family members, weekly bonuses for frontline associates and backup dependent care. 
These measures are important in protecting and supporting our associates and key to AmerisourceBergen's ability to support the foundational elements of health care. As you can imagine, the necessity of our services and solutions has been highlighted and amplified as manufacturers and providers navigate increased complexity and new challenges. To help efficiently and effectively address these challenges head on, we established an internal response task force that is made up of key experts and leaders across the company. Our task force has been advising individual teams and leaders and also meets with government officials. Task force help us move quickly to implement our business continuity plans, which are enabled by the robustness of our distribution network, technology and the talent and innovation of our associates. The strength in our infrastructure has enhanced our ability to provide patients access to the medications they need. AmerisourceBergen has a history of investing in our businesses and capabilities, giving us significant technological and operational flexibility. Last month, we demonstrated this when we temporarily closed 1 of our largest distribution centers out of an abundance of caution, given its proximity to COVID-19 hot spot. 
We invoked our business continuity plan for the region and seamlessly transferred volume to other AmerisourceBergen distribution centers. We used the temporary closure to perform extensive sanitation measures at the location. AmerisourceBergen also moved to South to protect non frontline associates. We were able to quickly shift all suitable roles to working remotely. This important distancing measure was achieved as a result of close leadership collaboration and strong IT infrastructure. The types of proactive measures would not be possible without the significant investments we have made in our distribution center, network and technology. 
On the pharmaceutical supply side, our sourcing and commercial teams have worked diligently to ensure that we are understanding demand and forecasting sustainability of supply to maintain the necessary inventory to address varying needs. We have made it a priority to keep in regular communication with all stakeholders to best maintain continuity of supply and meet increased demand from providers. This has been a period when alignment and coordination is vital. And we have amplified our proactive approach to communications and engagement. Our teams have held numerous customer virtual town halls in order to discuss factors influencing the supply chain, outline our response and business continuity and articulate the resources available to our customers. These events have facilitated reach to thousands of participants. And are a good example of AmerisourceBergen's calm, transparent and response. 
Despite these uncertain comps, I have been inspired days by the dedication, innovation and thoughtfulness displayed by AmerisourceBergen associates. We have seen firsthand the importance of our purpose-driven organization, especially given the vital role AmerisourceBergen plays in the health care system. It is hard like these that reinforce our confidence in AmerisourceBergen strategic position resiliency and ability to provide critical services and solutions in any economic climate. 
Over the years, we have focused much of our time with investors and analysts on providing visibility into AmerisourceBergen 4 strategic pillars. While the world around this has changed the way we are now working, the way we connect and the way we communicate, the key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart remain constant. Let me remind you of them and why they underscore our confidence in our strategic positioning. First, we have a diverse portfolio of customers with key anchor relationships in each segment. We have built and nurtured long-standing and collaborative partners with a diverse group of customers, ranging from community and national retailers to health systems and community physicians. An example from 1 of these customer groups is our good neighbor pharmacy, where members have been working tirelessly on the front line to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need even when things are at their most chaotic, whether by creating care packages for at-risk customers, providing drive-through services to making  sanitizer or keeping in touch with patients via social media, our independent pharmacy partners have done an exemplary job of showcasing the crucial part they play in improving community health. 
These types of relationships enable us to capitalize on pharmaceutical utilization in the United States across a variety of settings and distribution channels. Second, we maintain market-leading positions in specialty distribution and services, where pharmaceutical innovation and demographic trends will continue to drive long-term growth. During this period of social distancing, we've been working with our provider customers to help them navigate the complexity of operating in this environment, understanding that there are some natural delays in patients seeing doctors for necessary referrals. 
We believe the ability -- the availability of testing and improved operability of practices will enable these practices to serve more efficient to meet the complex needs of their new and existing patients. We have worked closely with our community physician practices to provide advanced analytics to help them navigate the temporary slowdown in patient visits due to social distancing. At the same time, our commercialization teams are working closely with their manufacturer partners to support efforts to ensure patients continue to be able to access vital pharmaceutical therapies. Our last business has been supporting a partners program that helps eligible unemployed patients maintain access to therapy despite loss of health insurance due to COVID-19. Additionally, World Courier's capability to provide direct-to-patient clinical trial services has been a key asset in supporting the shift of health care out of hospitals and into the home, thereby lowering the burden on hospitals and pharmacies. As complexity increases, World Courier thrives as its capabilities are unparalleled in its market. 
Navigating complexity is a foundational trade of AmerisourceBergen, and it powers our third key differentiator, our ability to provide innovative services and solutions we proactively invest and innovate to be best-in-class partners, as evidenced by the foresight that guided us to dedicate capital expenditures in our distribution center network, IT capabilities and specialized customer-focused solutions. One such example is a tool we are using to provide the advanced analytics for our community physician customers. Physician practices are leveraging our strategic financial intelligence solution, Infodat, to monitor and evaluate potential area of concern. Given the current situation, we are providing analyses to monitor areas impacted by COVID-19, such as new patient volume, transition to telehealth services and potential delays in claims processing and payments. 
At MWI, our team recognized that the need for veterinarian practices to virtually engage with their client has become critically important. In response, the business announced a series of technology tools to provide improved remote communication and enable curbside operations for practices and their patients. These examples illustrate a core strength for AmerisourceBergen. Our talent, expertise and resources facilitate our ability to provide comprehensive solutions. 
Finally, AmerisourceBergen continues to be a strong corporate steward with a focus on advancing talent and culture and maintaining strong financial health. Our talent and culture have been on full display in these recent weeks, delivering unparalleled value for all our stakeholders. We have heard from individuals across the organization as they are proud to work for a company like AmerisourceBergen with our priority on our purpose and values, especially during times of great societal need. 
At the same time, the financial health of the organization remains unchanged and with 1 of the strongest balance sheet in company history and a continued focus on cash flow generation. This financial stability and strength provides AmerisourceBergen with the flexibility and firepower to navigate the current environment effectively and continue to deploy capital appropriately in order to provide long-term value for all our stakeholders. 
Now I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and revised outlook for fiscal 2020. Jim?"

My remarks today will focus only on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter unless otherwise noted for a discussion of our GAAP results,",1600,"Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus only on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter unless otherwise noted for a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. Before I discuss our second quarter financial results and revised outlook for the second half of the year, I want to first take a moment to reflect on AmerisourceBergen and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In February, I reached my 5-year mark with the company. And over these past several weeks, I have never been prouder to be part of AmerisourceBergen. On our November earnings call, I said the associates, businesses and culture across AmerisourceBergen are fundamental to our success and to the incredible value proposition we deliver for our manufacturer and provider partners. While I did not know then the unprecedented circumstances, we find ourselves in now, the fundamental truth remains unchanged. AmerisourceBergen talent, purpose and businesses have the company and our partners well positioned to navigate new challenges and increase complexity. The vital access we enable and solutions we provide have taken center stage as health care has never been more important and the need for efficiency and stability so paramount. Our purpose and our culture are guiding our company and I feel privileged to be a part of it. We have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. 
Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has prioritized internal investment before all other capital deployment. Steve already detailed many of the investments that we are benefiting from now. So I will simply say that the results validate the investments in our businesses. The infrastructure tools, resources and talent that AmerisourceBergen has amassed enabled our robust business continuity plans to ensure continued patient access. 
Turning now to discuss our financial results and expectations. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will quickly cover our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance and second, I will cover the revision to our fiscal 2020 guidance. Given the current environment, I will focus much of my commentary on quantitative and qualitative color that is valuable in understanding the various impacts of COVID-19.  Beginning with our second quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, an increase of 14%, primarily due to higher operating income and, to a lesser extent, a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue was $47.4 billion, up over 9%, driven by strong revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health Group. 
Gross profit increased 7% or $99 million to $1.4 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% to $745 million. While operating expense growth in the quarter was driven by the timing of certain onetime items, we expect full year fiscal 2020 operating expense growth to be in the low single-digit range. Consolidated operating income was $672 million, up 9%, with our operating margin flat to the prior year quarter. 
As I noted in January, the March 2020 quarter benefited from the removal of PharMEDium from our adjusted results after the January decision to permanently exit the business, which incurred $14 million of operating losses in the prior year March quarter. Operating income still would have grown nearly 7% without that year-over-year comparison tailwind. Net interest expense decreased $9 million to $34 million. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 continues to have a favorable impact on the interest expense line. 
We have benefited from interest income on higher-than-expected cash balances in the first half of the year. Given the recent federal reserve rate cuts, we do not expect to have as significant of a benefit from interest income. 
Looking at the balance of the year, we expect quarterly net interest expense to be relatively in line with the March quarter. Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21.5%, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207 million shares. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares. Regarding free cash flow and our cash balance, fiscal year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow of $910 million, putting us right on track with our guidance for full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, of which $435 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. 
This completes a review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $46 billion, up 9%. The segment continued to benefit from growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong growth in specialty distribution and overall market growth. In the quarter, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. However, we also incurred elevated operating expenses, and consequently, there was no significant impact to operating income. 
Segment operating income increased about 9% to $563 million. We continued to benefit from our leading specialty physician services businesses and maintaining a strong portfolio of distribution customer relationships. 
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13% with all 3 operating segments delivering double-digit growth. The group had operating income of $108 million, up 8%, primarily driven by gross profit growth at MWI and World Courier, offset in part by higher operating expenses. This completes the review of our second quarter results, so I will now turn to our revised fiscal 2020 guidance. 
As we said in this morning's press release, we are lowering our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.35 to $7.65, down from the previous range of $7.55 to $7.8. And normally, after the execution and performance of our businesses in the first half, we would be raising our full year guidance. However, given these unprecedented times, we must revise guidance to reflect the potential impacts of COVID-19 for the second half of the year. 
As we look at the second half of the year, the main factor impacting the range of potential outcomes for the year is the magnitude and duration of patient disruption. We have analyzed and probability weighted to potential COVID-19 to current disruption, it's manageable for AmerisourceBergen and our businesses are resilient. We are also monitoring weekly volume trends to understand business and product mix impacts. April trends provide some insight and were encouraging with sales growth overall for our full line distribution and oncology. 
Our non-oncology physician business saw significant weekly sales decline year-over-year in the beginning of April, but those declines began to soften towards the end of the month. We anticipate that for the physician class of trade, delays in diagnoses and necessary testing will delay future sales of physician-administered pharmaceuticals. Additionally, certain of our Global Commercialization services & Animal Health businesses, in particular, MWI, will be impacted by lower volumes. 
Overall, our revised guidance factors in a double-digit adjusted EPS decline in the third quarter, some of which is related to the March pull board of Pharmaceutical sales that I called out earlier, and then a return to EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Factors that move us within our guidance range  include the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts on our businesses and also the speed of the rebound of our businesses. Factors that are not incorporated into our guidance range because we do not currently expect these factors to occur include a higher magnitude impact of COVID-19 on our businesses throughout our full fourth quarter and any significant bad debt expense beyond current assumptions. The resulting full year guidance ranges are: revenue in the low- to mid- single digit percent growth range. Operating income, both at the consolidated level in pharmaceutical distribution to be in the low to mid single-digit percent growth range. Operating income for Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses is now expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range. 
Finally, given the share buyback so far this year, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to between 206 million and 207 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 208 million shares for the year. There is no change to our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020. The health of our cash flow and balance sheet supports AmerisourceBergen's ability to focus on ensuring continued patient access to care. 
In closing, there is still much that remains to be learned as the country states, businesses and individuals contemplate the appropriate path forward.

Before turning the call over for Q&A, I want to take a minute to discuss AmerisourceBergen's commitment to responsible corporate citizenship.

Our commitment to the health of our associates and communities influences every decision we make and is served as a vital guide as the world around us continues to change. The past several weeks have been a period of disruption for the world and has brought many challenges. Our lives have been dramatically altered and the importance of health and well-being has been reinforced. While I cannot tell you what exactly will happen in each and every element of our business over the coming weeks and months, I can tell you that we will emerge from this period with enhanced capabilities and solutions as well as the heightened awareness of the value we create for all stakeholders. I have been profoundly impressed by the exceptional leadership and collaborative teamwork throughout the organization. Thanks to this, we have been able to rapidly adapt and proactively address potential concerns caused by COVID-19.  I'd like to thank, in particular, those associates on the front lines our nurses, pharmacist and distribution center associates whose powerful devotion and determination made this all possible. AmerisourceBergen is powered by the talent of our associates, and we are staying true to and guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.

As we start to think about this potential recessionary environment post COVID-19, how are you thinking about pharmaceutical utilization, looking back at those periods, thinking about this, what you have in your guidance, you talked about the rebound getting into your fourth quarter. But generally speaking, if you can talk about trends there, any trends that you're seeing shifts? I think 1 of the concerns in the market is that if we do see more people getting prescriptions delivered to the home, what does that mean for the margins on that business for home delivery with PBMs for  mailer versus coming into the pharmacy. And then how do we think about specialty trends? Again, you talked about oncology coming back. As you think about April, non-oncology is still weak. But what's your anticipation there as we start to think about things like telemedicine, virtual care visits, as this all starts to change with COVID-19. 
I know that's a lot to kind of break down there, but I just want to really understand how you think about the trends going forward."

We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in 1 question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, I still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end of May in-person, I was reluctant to change it to a virtual meeting. So there's no doubt that this has been more sustained, more serious than anything we faced the society in recent memory, which you don't need me to  parting  on. We have more than enough people are parting on that. I think in health care, look, prescriptions are the most efficient form of health care. They've proven to be very resilient. Patients want to continue to take their prescriptions. So we start with that, that's a really good business. Some of the trends, obviously, it's been difficult for people to get to physicians' offices. I think it's been somewhat interesting. A friend of mine is a cardiologist said, people are willing to go to the grocery store, but they're not willing to come visit me when they have a serious issue, and that led to much more serious issues. So I think there's been -- when I think about reopening, I hope that the first thing people will do is go back to their physicians' offices, their dentists, their physical therapists, this is what they should be thinking about getting back to health and wellness as a priority. But just a couple of trends. Microsoft said on the earnings call that they -- 2 years, they've experienced 2 years of digital acceleration in 2 months. I think in telehealth, I've heard it described as 10 years of acceptance. Having said that, post COVID, there will be much more restrictions, for example, on telehealth from 1 state to another. But we can't expect that trend. I think that generally that e-commerce as opposed to regular mail order is going to be much more important. And we'll be thinking about that as part of digital acceleration. So we'll be thinking about that, I talk about for the 3 pillars of AmerisourceBergen community pharmacy, community veterinarians, community oncologists and physicians, specialty physicians. We'll be thinking about how to assist all of them with that digital transformation. In fact, our strategy groups some of the smartest people in the company, we've been thinking through that, and we're getting ready for that. And that's part of the comment about AmerisourceBergen being better prepared when we come out of this crisis, we'll be well positioned as well positioned as we were going into it. I think you also need to look at our diverse customer base. We are represented with anchor customers in every segment. And so we do benefit. Yes, I will admit, of course, that, of course, it's a high-margin business for us, the community pharmacy business than shipping to 100 mail order sites. Of course, that's true, and there's different working capital metrics associated with that. But we don't expect a very significant trend to occur once things emerge. We do think, again, that it's very important to bring those customers into e-commerce. On specialty, we have seen some patient -- new patient starts slowed down. We've even seen some very specialized medicines in some of the base medical business slowdown. But we do believe, and I think with a lot of logic and experience that those will be some of the first prescriptions and the first visits to come back, as I referenced. Oncology is holding up well. Again, the softness has really been related to lower new patients. The longer the restrictions continue, we would expect further weakness or if there's a reemergence of hotspots in certain areas. The hospitals, we believe, are continuing to resume to normal operations, and that will be a positive trend for us. And a pathology report has been a key gating factor towards getting new diagnosis for oncology and believe all of those areas are starting to open up. So I've rambled on quite a lot chat. I'm sure we're going to get to some more questions, but excellent question, Lisa, and good to hear your voice. 
Thank you. Next question, please."

Our physicians have",347,"Yes. As I -- Bob, hope you are doing well. So referrals have been impacted and patient visits as some specialty practices, as I mentioned, have been working through essentially the limitations of operating in a social distancing world. Our physicians have, as we understand, started using telehealth as much as possible, and also they've had to use no waiting rooms, texting people to come upstairs for visits, et cetera. So everyone had to adapt to the new order and. And again, we anticipate that would carry on for a couple more weeks or a couple of months. And of course, lower visits and delay in pathology reports, et cetera, and new diagnosis has had led to a mix of some large sales. And -- but we do believe it's also world lead. It has lead to pent-up demand. So we you're dealing with complex illnesses. The therapy is extremely valuable life-saving to those patients, and we expect that, that will be the first to resume and until there will be a real pent-up demand and those physicians are going to be kind of analogist  to the ER physicians, they're going to have to keep working around the clock literally to keep up, I think once everyone feels safe to go back to the offices. And also, we think that it will vary by state, as certain states reopen or certain states have less hotspots areas. So we are a national business, so we'll see that resume. 
And of course, it goes without saying that people with critical illnesses need to be examined, referred and treated by the specialist. Oncology has been holding up relatively well, probably because those patients who were under treatment are continuing their treatment. Ophthalmology has been under pressure. We're starting to see some trends of normalizing or stability. And again, I talked about the pathology reports and the hospitals being able to return. So an increased availability of testing would allow for a more capable operating environment for physicians. 
So I hope that gets your question, Bob. Jim has a comment, please?"

But the other thing I think is that we say, which is really happens to be true, is our first priority is in terms of investments. Jim  has really detailed how important those investments in IT, infrastructure, distribution business continuity plan has been incredibly fortuitous productive for our businesses. And I would say that the other thing that we've invested in a lot is communications and culture. And maybe that's not something that is communicable that well to invest this. But it's been incredibly important the constant communication we've had to our people has been 1 of the best investments that we've had throughout this period. And that's because we have quite a great internet  site and we we have had the ability to have 70% of our associates working at home, but still be able to support them. And we have  town hall meetings where we have over 6,000 people. So I think that's very important. 
As far as M&A goes, we always are open to look at it. We haven't seen the value offer there. A lot of our interest in M&A has been in the commercialization service area. We've -- that is very much we need really good technology, good people, good customer bases. And we literally think that when we look at acquisitions, they should be additive to our own businesses and at least equal policy. And we often just don't see that. And then the PE market has been very, very robust. So that's just hasn't been an [indiscernible]. 
I'll hand over to Jim because you asked a broad question. But now let me just say on opioid litigation. We have been busy with the pandemic. So there's essentially no substantive update. And we remain very focused on the company's critical needs at this time, but we do believe that the global settlement that has been offered is 1 that should be taken very seriously. And we hope that -- we hope that the necessary  parties will see that the merits of the potential global framework, and we'll continue our efforts on that front.

Let me start, and I'll address the question you had, the extensive question you had on our other segments. And what we indicated today is that for the segment, for the fiscal year, we're expecting the decline of operating income to be in the low single-digit percent range for the fiscal year. And the 2 largest businesses in the Other segments are of MWI and World Courier. So I'll really kind of focus my remarks there. And MWI had a really strong quarter. We disclosed the revenues in the Q. Revenue growth was 10%, strong operating income growth during the quarter. It's really well positioned. But the animal health market will be impacted by COVID-19 and MWI will be impacted. 
Companion animal vet visits are impacted by social distancing. Production animal will be impacted by substantially reduced sales of protein to restaurants and hotels and also be impacted by some supply chain issues due to closed packing plants. I think probably companion animal will come back quicker than production animals. And -- but both markets will come back and be strong. And MWI is really well positioned in the market. Steve talked in his prepared remarks about some of the technology things MWI is doing. And that market comes back, MWI will be as strong or stronger than ever. Very quickly on World Courier. It's a really interesting case study. If we had looked back a couple of months ago, we would have thought the World Courier would have been 1 of our businesses most impacted by the onset of COVID-19 because of its international presence, whether it be in China or South Korea or Italy or any of the other countries where it operates. So what we found is that something we always knew that World Courier really excels by managing complexity for manufacturers. And so what we're seeing is World Courier, while number of shipments might be down, weights up, the shipments to in-home settings is up. And as we look at World Courier today, the impacts of COVID-19, we think, while the impact of the impacts will be significantly less than what we would have thought of a couple of months ago. 
With regard to the rest of the businesses in the group, there will be some impact in consulting, but like the rest of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, they're resilient and will be very manageable."

And so as we do look at the business, we do think that companion animals will come back quicker than production animals. But as I said before, both markets will come back and MWI is really well positioned. So when the market does come back, it will be stronger, stronger than ever."

And -- but we also indicated that we had elevated costs, so there was not an operating income impact or at least there wasn't a significant operating income impact and to provide a little bit more detail there we established an incremental bad debt reserve of $19 million in the March quarter related to the onset of COVID-19. And it's not related to any specific customers, but we did consider the credit environment and financial strength of customers. So that's really what caused there to be a revenue in [ TP ] pull forward, but not an impact to operating income. And then there were some other smaller costs in the March quarter, which had to do with, like important things such as IT, work-from-home enablement, bonuses for frontline distribution center associates, cleaning supplies and services. And so for all those reasons, there was a pull-through of revenue income, gross profit, but not a significant impact on operating income during the quarter."

As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us,",1508,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us, I will focus this morning's call on 2 main areas. First, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and second, we will talk about how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long-term for our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and our communities. Jim will then discuss our results in more detail and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
First, with regard to the actions we have taken in response to the COVID 2019 dynamic. I've never been prouder of AmerisourceBergen and our associates. We have been guided by our purpose and values, and the company has prioritized supporting the safety of our associates. In turn, our associates have been innovating in helping our manufacturer and provider customers navigate new or intensified challenges. The health, safety and well-being of our associates is paramount, and we have taken several steps to support our frontline associates, which have included enhanced cleaning protocols and additional support from third-party cleaners, enhanced paid time-off for associates leading to quarantine care for family members, weekly bonuses for frontline associates and backup dependent care. These measures are important in protecting and supporting our associates and key to AmerisourceBergen's ability to support the foundational elements of healthcare. As you can imagine, the necessity of our services and solutions has been highlighted and amplified as manufacturers and providers navigate increased complexity and new challenges.
To help efficiently and effectively address these challenges head on, we established an internal response task force that is made up of key experts and leaders across the company. Our task force has been advising individual teams and leaders and also meets with government officials. Task force help us move quickly to implement our business continuity plans, which are enabled by the robustness of our distribution network. Technology and the talent and innovation of our associates. The strength in our infrastructure has enhanced our ability to provide patients access to the medications they need. AmerisourceBergen has a history of investing in our businesses and capabilities, giving us significant technological and operational flexibility. Last month, we demonstrated this when we temporarily closed one of our largest distribution centers out of an abundance of caution, given its proximity to COVID-19 hot spot. We invoked our business continuity plan for the region and seamlessly transferred volume to other AmerisourceBergen distribution centers. We used the temporary closure to perform extensive sanitation measures at the location. AmerisourceBergen also moved the site to lead and protect non frontline associates. We were able to quickly shift all suitable roles to working remotely. This important distancing measure was achieved as a result of close leadership collaboration and strong IT infrastructure. The types of proactive measures would not be possible without the significant investments we have made in our distribution center, network and technology. On the pharmaceutical supply side, our sourcing and commercial teams have worked diligently to ensure that we are understanding demand and forecasting sustainability of supply to maintain the necessary inventory to address varying needs.
We have made it a priority to keep in regular communication with all stakeholders to best maintain continuity of supply and meet increased demand from providers. This has been a period when alignment and coordination is vital. And we have amplified our proactive approach to communications and engagements. Our teams have held numerous customer virtual town halls in order to discuss factors influencing the supply chain. Outline our response and business continuity and articulate the resources available to our customers. These events have facilitated reach to thousands of participants. And are a good example of AmerisourceBergen's calm, transparent and patient-focused response. Despite these uncertain comps, I have been inspired daily by the dedication, innovation and thoughtfulness displayed by AmerisourceBergen associates. We have seen firsthand the importance of our purpose-driven organization, especially given the vital role AmerisourceBergen plays in the healthcare system. It is times like these that reinforce our confidence in AmerisourceBergen's strategic position, resiliency and ability to provide critical services and solutions in any economic climate.
Over the years, we have focused much of our time with investors and analysts on providing visibility into AmerisourceBergen's 4 strategic pillars. While the world around us has changed the way we are now working, the way we connect and the way we communicate, the key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart remain constant. Let me remind you of them and why they underscore our confidence in our strategic positioning. First, we have a diverse portfolio of customers with key anchor relationships in each segment. We have built and nurtured long-standing and collaborative partners with a diverse group of customers, ranging from community and national retailers to health systems and community physicians.
An example from one of these customer groups is our Good Neighbor Pharmacy, where members have been working tirelessly on the front line to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need even when things are at their most chaotic, whether by creating care packages for at-risk customers, providing drive-through services to making hand sanitizer or keeping in touch with patients via social media, our independent pharmacy partners have done an exemplary job of showcasing the crucial part they play in improving community health. These types of relationships enable us to capitalize on pharmaceutical utilization in the United States across a variety of settings and distribution channels.
Second, we maintain market-leading positions in specialty distribution and services, where pharmaceutical innovation and demographic trends will continue to drive long-term growth. During this period of social distancing, we've been working with our provider customers to help them navigate the complexity of operating in this environment, understanding that there are some natural delays in patients seeing doctors for necessary referrals. We believe the ability -- the availability of testing and improved operability of practices will enable these practices to serve more efficient to meet the complex needs of their new and existing patients. We have worked closely with our community physician practices to provide advanced analytics to help them navigate the temporary slowdown in patient visits due to social distancing. At the same time, our commercialization teams are working closely with their manufacturer partners to support efforts to ensure patients continue to be able to access vital pharmaceutical therapies. Our Lash business has been supporting our partners program that helps eligible unemployed patients maintain access to therapy despite loss of health insurance due to COVID-19. Additionally, World Courier's capability to provide direct-to-patient clinical trial services has been a key asset in supporting the shift of healthcare out of hospitals and into the home, thereby lowering the burden on hospitals and pharmacies. As complexity increases, World Courier thrives as its capabilities are unparalleled in its market.
Navigating complexity is a foundational trade of AmerisourceBergen, and it powers our third key differentiator, our ability to provide innovative services and solutions we proactively invest and innovate to be best-in-class partners, as evidenced by the foresight that guided us to dedicate capital expenditures in our distribution center network, IT capabilities and specialized customer-focused solutions. One such example is a tool we are using to provide the advanced analytics for our community physician customers. Physician practices are leveraging our strategic financial intelligence solution, Infodat, to monitor and evaluate potential areas of concern. Given the current situation, we are providing analyses to monitor areas impacted by COVID-19, such as new patient volume, transition to Telehealth services and potential delays in claims processing and payments. At MWI, our team recognized that the need for veterinarian practices to virtually engage with their client has become critically important. In response, the business announced a series of technology tools to provide improved remote communication and enable curbside operations for practices and their patients. These examples illustrate a core strength for AmerisourceBergen. Our talent, expertise and resources facilitate our ability to provide comprehensive solutions.
Finally, AmerisourceBergen continues to be a strong corporate steward with a focus on advancing talent and culture and maintaining strong financial health. Our talent and culture have been on full display in these recent weeks, delivering unparalleled value for all our stakeholders. We have heard from individuals across the organization that they are proud to work for a company like AmerisourceBergen with our priority on our purpose and values, especially during times of great societal need.
At the same time, the financial health of the organization remains unchanged and with one of the strongest balance sheet in company history and a continued focus on cash flow generation. This financial stability and strength provides AmerisourceBergen with the flexibility and firepower to navigate the current environment effectively and continue to deploy capital appropriately in order to provide long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and revised outlook for fiscal 2020. Jim?"

My remarks today will focus only on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter unless otherwise noted for a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. Before I discuss our second quarter financial results and revised outlook for the second half of the year, I want to first take a moment to reflect on AmerisourceBergen and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In February, I reached my 5-year mark with the company. And over these past several weeks, I have never been prouder to be part of AmerisourceBergen. On our November earnings call, I said the associates, businesses and culture across AmerisourceBergen are fundamental to our success and to the incredible value proposition we deliver for our manufacturer and provider partners. While I did not know then the unprecedented circumstances, we find ourselves in now, the fundamental truth remains unchanged. AmerisourceBergen's talent, purpose and businesses have the company and our partners well positioned to navigate new challenges and increased complexity. The vital access we enable and solutions we provide have taken center stage as healthcare has never been more important and the need for efficiency and stability so paramount. Our purpose and our culture are guiding our company and I feel privileged to be a part of it.
We have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has prioritized internal investment before all other capital deployment. Steve already detailed many of the investments that we are benefiting from now. So I will simply say that the results validate the investments in our businesses. The infrastructure tools, resources and talent that AmerisourceBergen has amassed enabled our robust business continuity plans to ensure continued patient access.
Turning now to discuss our financial results and expectations. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will quickly cover our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance and second, I will cover the revision to our fiscal 2020 guidance. Given the current environment, I will focus much of my commentary on quantitative and qualitative color that is valuable in understanding the various impacts of COVID-19.
Beginning with our second quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, an increase of 14%, primarily due to higher operating income and, to a lesser extent, a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue was $47.4 billion, up over 9%, driven by strong revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health Group. Gross profit increased 7% or $99 million to $1.4 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% to $745 million. While operating expense growth in the quarter was driven by the timing of certain onetime items, we expect full year fiscal 2020 operating expense growth to be in the low single-digit range. Consolidated operating income was $672 million, up 9%, with our operating margin flat to the prior year quarter.
As I noted in January, the March 2020 quarter benefited from the removal of PharMEDium from our adjusted results after the January decision to permanently exit the business, which incurred $14 million of operating losses in the prior year March quarter. Operating income still would have grown nearly 7% without that year-over-year comparison tailwind. Net interest expense decreased $9 million to $34 million. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 continues to have a favorable impact on the interest expense line.
We have benefited from interest income on higher-than-expected cash balances in the first half of the year. Given the recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, we do not expect to have as significant of a benefit from interest income. Looking at the balance of the year, we expect quarterly net interest expense to be relatively in line with the March quarter.
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21.5%, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207 million shares. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares. Regarding free cash flow and our cash balance, fiscal year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow of $910 million, putting us right on track with our guidance for full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, of which $435 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.
This completes a review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $46 billion, up 9%. The segment continued to benefit from growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong growth in specialty distribution and overall market growth. In the quarter, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. However, we also incurred elevated operating expenses, and consequently, there was no significant impact to operating income.
Segment operating income increased about 9% to $563 million. We continued to benefit from our leading specialty physician services businesses and maintaining a strong portfolio of distribution customer relationships.
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13% with all 3 operating segments delivering double-digit growth. The group had operating income of $108 million, up 8%, primarily driven by gross profit growth at MWI and World Courier, offset in part by higher operating expenses. This completes the review of our second quarter results so I will now turn to our revised fiscal 2020 guidance.
As we said in this morning's press release, we are lowering our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.35 to $7.65, down from the previous range of $7.55 to $7.80. And normally, after the execution and performance of our businesses in the first half, we would be raising our full year guidance. However, given these unprecedented times, we must revise guidance to reflect the potential impacts of COVID-19 for the second half of the year. As we look at the second half of the year, the main factor impacting the range of potential outcomes for the year is the magnitude and duration of patient disruption. We have analyzed and probability weighted the potential COVID-19 related impacts. Overall, we feel strongly that the current disruption is manageable for AmerisourceBergen and our businesses are resilient. We are also monitoring weekly volume trends to understand business and product mix impacts. April trends provide some insight and were encouraging with sales growth overall for our full line distribution and oncology. Our non-oncology physician business saw significant weekly sales decline year-over-year in the beginning of April, but those declines began to soften towards the end of the month. We anticipate that for the physician class of trade, delays in diagnoses and necessary testing will delay future sales of physician-administered pharmaceuticals. Additionally, certain of our Global Commercialization services & Animal Health businesses, in particular, MWI, will be impacted by lower volumes.
Overall, our revised guidance factors in a double-digit adjusted EPS decline in the third quarter, some of which is related to the March pull-forward of Pharmaceutical sales that I called out earlier, and then a return to EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Factors that move us within our guidance range include the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts on our businesses and also the speed of the rebound of our businesses. Factors that are not incorporated into our guidance range because we do not currently expect these factors to occur include a higher magnitude impact of COVID-19 on our businesses throughout our full fourth quarter and any significant bad debt expense beyond current assumptions. The resulting full year guidance ranges are: revenue in the low- to mid- single digit percent growth range. Operating income, both at the consolidated level in pharmaceutical distribution to be in the low to mid-single-digit percent growth range. Operating income for Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses is now expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range.
Finally, given the share buyback so far this year, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to between 206 million and 207 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 208 million shares for the year. There is no change to our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020. The health of our cash flow and balance sheet supports AmerisourceBergen's ability to focus on ensuring continued patient access to care.
In closing, there is still much that remains to be learned as the country, states, businesses and individuals contemplate the appropriate path forward. But hopefully, you will appreciate the guidance update and additional color as we seek to enhance transparency and communication, especially in this unprecedented environment. AmerisourceBergen is focused on doing what is best, protecting and supporting our associates, providing key services and solutions to our partners to enable continued patient access and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. We are well positioned by our pharmaceutical centric strategy with deep strategic relationships across our company and significant financial strength. And importantly, we are guided by our purpose, driven by our talent and culture and positively differentiated by our businesses and our customers.
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back over to Steve."

But what's your anticipation there as we start to think about things like telemedicine, virtual care visits, as this world starts to change with COVID-19.
I know that's a lot to kind of break down there, but I just want to really understand how you think about the trends going forward."

We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end of Ma",710,"Yes. Lisa, thank you. We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end of May in-person, I was reluctant to change it to a virtual meeting. So there's no doubt that this has been more sustained, more serious than anything we faced -- the society in recent memory, which you don't need me to part on. We have more than enough people are parting on that. I think in healthcare, look, prescriptions are the most efficient form of healthcare. They've proven to be very resilient. Patients want to continue to take their prescriptions. So we start with that, that's a really good business. Some of the trends, obviously, it's been difficult for people to get to physicians' offices. I think it's been somewhat interesting. A friend of mine, who is a cardiologist, said, people are willing to go to the grocery store, but they're not willing to come visit me when they have a serious issue, and that led to much more serious issues. So I think there's been -- when I think about reopening, I hope that the first thing people will do is go back to their physicians' offices, their dentists, their physical therapists, this is what they should be thinking about getting back to health and wellness as a priority. But just a couple of trends. Microsoft said on their earnings call that they've -- 2 years, they've experienced 2 years of digital acceleration in 2 months. I think in Telehealth, I've heard it described as 10 years of acceptance. Having said that, post COVID, there will be much more restrictions, for example, on Telehealth from one state to another. But we can't expect that trend. I think that generally that e-commerce as opposed to regular mail order is going to be much more important. And we'll be thinking about that as part of digital acceleration. So we'll be thinking about that, I talk about for -- the 3 pillars of AmerisourceBergen community pharmacy, community veterinarians, community oncologists and physicians, specialty physicians. We'll be thinking about how to assist all of them with that digital transformation. In fact, our strategy groups, some of the smartest people in the company, we've been thinking through that, and we're getting ready for that. And that's part of the comment about AmerisourceBergen being better prepared when we come out of this crisis, we'll be well positioned -- as well positioned as we were going into it. I think you also need to look at our diverse customer base. We are represented with anchor customers in every segment. And so we do benefit. Yes, I will admit, of course, that, of course, it's a high-margin business for us, the community pharmacy business than shipping to 100 mail order sites. Of course, that's true, and there's different working capital metrics associated with that. But we don't expect a very significant trend to occur once things emerge. We do think, again, that it's very important to bring those customers into e-commerce. On specialty, we have seen some patient -- new patient starts slowed down. We've even seen some very specialized medicines in some of the base medical business slowdown. But we do believe, and I think with a lot of logic and experience that those will be some of the first prescriptions and the first visits to come back, as I referenced. Oncology is holding up well. Again, the softness has really been related to lower new patients. The longer the restrictions continue, we would expect further weakness or if there's a reemergence of hotspots in certain areas. The hospitals, we believe, are continuing to resume to normal operations, and that will be a positive trend for us. And a pathology report has been a key gating factor towards getting new diagnosis for oncology and believe all of those areas are starting to open up. So I've rambled on quite a lot of chat. I'm sure we're going to get to some more questions, but excellent question, Lisa, and good to hear your voice.
Thank you. Next question, please."

Any sense you can give us on how those scripts have trended, specifically relative to the broader prescription market?

Our phy",350,"Yes. I mean I -- as I -- Bob, hope you are doing well. So referrals have been impacted and patient visits at some specialty practices, as I mentioned, have been working through essentially the limitations of operating in a social distancing world. Our physicians have, as we understand, started using Telehealth as much as possible, and also they've had to use no waiting rooms, texting people to come upstairs for visits, et cetera. So everyone had to adapt to the new order and. And again, we anticipate that would carry on for a couple more weeks or a couple more months. And of course, lower visits and delay in pathology reports, et cetera, and new diagnosis has led to a mix of some large sales. And -- but we do believe it's also world lead. It has led to pent-up demand. So when you're dealing with complex illnesses, the therapy is extremely valuable life-saving to those patients, and we expect that, that will be the first to resume and until there will be a real pent-up demand and those physicians are going to be kind of analogists to the ER physicians, they're going to have to keep working around the clock literally to keep up, I think once everyone feels safe to go back to the offices. And also, we think that it will vary by state, as certain states reopen or certain states have less hotspots areas. So we are a national business, so we'll see that resume.
And of course, it goes without saying that people with critical illnesses need to be examined, referred and treated by the specialists. Oncology has been holding up relatively well, probably because those patients who were under treatment are continuing their treatment. Ophthalmology has been under pressure. We're starting to see some trends of normalizing or stability. And again, I talked about the pathology reports and the hospitals being able to return. So an increased availability of testing would allow for a more capable operating environment for physicians.
So I hope that gets your question, Bob. Jim has a comment, please?"

That is what you're worried about was regulation and reimbursement, and it became much more apparent over my 10 year than over his.
But the other thing I think is that we say, which is really happens to be true, is our first priority is internal investments. Jim has really detailed how important those investments in IT, infrastructure, distribution business continuity plan has been incredibly fortuitous productive for our businesses. And I would say that the other thing that we've invested in a lot is communications and culture. And maybe that's not something that is communicable that well to invest this. But it's been incredibly important. The constant communication we've had to our people has been one of the best investments that we've had throughout this period. And that's because we have quite a great internet site and we we have had the ability to have 70% of our associates working at home, but still be able to support them. And we have town hall meetings where we have over 6,000 people. So I think that's very important.
As far as M&A goes, we always are open to look at it. We haven't seen the value offer there. A lot of our interest in M&A has been in the commercialization services area. We've -- that is very much we need really good technology, good people, good customer bases. And we literally think that when we look at acquisitions, they should be additive to our own businesses and at least equal policy. And we often just don't see that. And then the PE market has been very, very robust. So that's just hasn't been anything.
I'll hand over to Jim because you asked a broad question. But now let me just say on opioid litigation. We have been busy with the pandemic. So there's essentially no substantive update. And we remain very focused on the company's critical needs at this time, but we do believe that the global settlement that has been offered is one that should be taken very seriously. And we hope that -- we hope that the necessary parties will see that the merits of the potential global framework, and we'll continue our efforts on that front.

Let me start, and I'll address the question you had, the extensive question you had on our other segments. And what we indicated today is that for the segment, for the fiscal year, we're expecting the decline of operating income to be in the low single-digit percent range for the fiscal year. And the 2 largest businesses in the Other segments are MWI and World Courier. So I'll really kind of focus my remarks there. And MWI had a really strong quarter. We disclosed the revenues in the Q. Revenue growth was 10%, strong operating income growth during the quarter. It's really well positioned. But the animal health market will be impacted by COVID-19 and MWI will be impacted.
Companion animal vet visits are impacted by social distancing. Production animal will be impacted by substantially reduced sales of protein to restaurants and hotels and also be impacted by some supply chain issues due to closed packing plants. I think probably companion animal will come back quicker than production animals. And -- but both markets will come back and be strong. And MWI is really well positioned in the market. Steve talked in his prepared remarks about some of the technology things MWI is doing. And that market comes back, MWI will be as strong or stronger than ever. Very quickly on World Courier. It's a really interesting case study. If we had looked back a couple of months ago, we would have thought the World Courier would have been one of our businesses most impacted by the onset of COVID-19 because of its international presence, whether it be in China or South Korea or Italy or any of the other countries where it operates. So what we found is that something we always knew that World Courier really excels by managing complexity for manufacturers. And so what we're seeing is World Courier, while number of shipments might be down, weights up, the shipments to in-home settings is up. And as we look at World Courier today, the impacts of COVID-19, we think, while the impact of the impacts will be significantly less than what we would have thought of a couple of months ago.
With regard to the rest of the businesses in the group, there will be some impact in consulting, but like the rest of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, they're resilient and will be very manageable."

And it's not related to any specific customers, but we did consider the credit environment and financial strength of customers. So that's really what caused there to be a revenue in TP pull forward, but not an impact to operating income. And then there were some other smaller costs in the March quarter, which had to do with, like important things such as IT, work-from-home enablement, bonuses for frontline distribution center associates, cleaning supplies and services.

As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us,",1505,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us, I will focus this morning's call on 2 main areas. First, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and second, we will talk about how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long-term for our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and our communities. Jim will then discuss our results in more detail and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
First, with regard to the actions we have taken in response to the COVID 2019 dynamic. I've never been prouder of AmerisourceBergen and our associates. We have been guided by our purpose and values, and the company has prioritized supporting the safety of our associates. In turn, our associates have been innovating in helping our manufacturer and provider customers navigate new or intensified challenges. The health, safety and well-being of our associates is paramount, and we have taken several steps to support our frontline associates, which have included, enhanced cleaning protocols and additional support from third-party cleaners, enhanced paid time-off for associates needing to quarantine or care for family members, weekly bonuses for frontline associates and backup dependent care. These measures are important in protecting and supporting our associates and key to AmerisourceBergen's ability to support the foundational elements of healthcare. As you can imagine, the necessity of our services and solutions has been highlighted and amplified as manufacturers and providers navigate increased complexity and new challenges.
To help efficiently and effectively address these challenges head on, we established an internal response task force that is made up of key experts and leaders across the company. Our task force has been advising individual teams and leaders and also meets with government officials. Task force help us move quickly to implement our business continuity plans, which are enabled by the robustness of our distribution network, technology and the talent and innovation of our associates. 
The strength of our infrastructure has enhanced our ability to provide patients access to the medications they need. AmerisourceBergen has a history of investing in our businesses and capabilities, giving us significant technological and operational flexibility. Last month, we demonstrated this when we temporarily closed one of our largest distribution centers out of an abundance of caution, given its proximity to a COVID-19 hot spot. We invoked our business continuity plan for the region and seamlessly transferred volume to other AmerisourceBergen distribution centers. We used the temporary closure to perform extensive sanitation measures at the location. AmerisourceBergen also moved decisively to protect non frontline associates. We were able to quickly shift all suitable roles to working remotely. This important distancing measure was achieved as a result of close leadership collaboration and strong IT infrastructure.  The types of proactive measures would not be possible without the significant investments we have made in our distribution center, network and technology. 
On the pharmaceutical supply side, our sourcing and commercial teams have worked diligently to ensure that we are understanding demand and forecasting sustainability of supply to maintain the necessary inventory to address varying needs.  We have made it a priority to keep in regular communication with all stakeholders to best maintain continuity of supply and meet increased demand from providers. This has been a period when alignment and coordination is vital. And we have amplified our proactive approach to communications and engagements. Our teams have held numerous customer virtual town halls in order to discuss factors influencing the supply chain, outline our response and business continuity and articulate the resources available to our customers. These events have facilitated reach to thousands of participants, and are a good example of AmerisourceBergen's calm, transparent and patient-focused response. 
Despite these uncertain times, I have been inspired daily by the dedication, innovation and thoughtfulness displayed by AmerisourceBergen associates. We have seen firsthand the importance of our purpose-driven organization, especially given the vital role AmerisourceBergen plays in the healthcare system. It is times like these that reinforce our confidence in AmerisourceBergen's strategic position, resiliency and ability to provide critical services and solutions in any economic climate.
Over the years, we have focused much of our time with investors and analysts on providing visibility into AmerisourceBergen's 4 strategic pillars. While the world around us has changed the way we are now working, the way we connect and the way we communicate, the key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart remain a constant. Let me remind you of them and why they underscore our confidence in our strategic positioning. 
First, we have a diverse portfolio of customers with key anchor relationships in each segment. We have built and nurtured long-standing and collaborative partners with a diverse group of customers, ranging from community and national retailers to health systems and community physicians. An example from one of these customer groups is our Good Neighbor Pharmacy, where members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need even when things are at their most chaotic. Whether by creating care packages for at-risk customers, providing drive-through services, to making hand sanitizer or keeping in touch with patients via social media, our independent pharmacy partners have done an exemplary job of showcasing the crucial part they play in improving community health. These types of relationships enable us to capitalize on pharmaceutical utilization in the United States across a variety of settings and distribution channels.
Second, we maintain market-leading positions in specialty distribution and services, where pharmaceutical innovation and demographic trends will continue to drive long-term growth. During this period of social distancing, we've been working with our provider customers to help them navigate the complexity of operating in this environment, understanding that there are some natural delays in patients seeing doctors for necessary referrals. We believe the ability -- the availability of testing and improved operability of practices will enable these practices to serve more efficiently  the complex needs of their new and existing patients. 
We have worked closely with our community physician practices to provide advanced analytics to help them navigate the temporary slowdown in patient visits due to social distancing. At the same time, our commercialization teams are working closely with their manufacturer partners to support efforts to ensure patients continue to be able to access vital pharmaceutical therapies. 
Our Lash business has been supporting our partners program that helps eligible unemployed patients maintain access to therapy despite loss of health insurance due to COVID-19. Additionally, World Courier's capability to provide direct-to-patient clinical trial services has been a key asset in supporting the shift of healthcare out of hospitals and into the home, thereby lowering the burden on hospitals and pharmacies. As complexity increases, World Courier thrives as its capabilities are unparalleled in its market.
Navigating complexity is a foundational trait of AmerisourceBergen, and it powers our third key differentiator, our ability to provide innovative services and solutions. We proactively invest and innovate to be best-in-class partners, as evidenced by the foresight that guided us to dedicate capital expenditures in our distribution center network, IT capabilities and specialized customer-focused solutions. One such example is a tool we are using to provide the advanced analytics for our community physician customers. Physician practices are leveraging our strategic financial intelligence solution, Infodat, to monitor and evaluate potential areas of concern. Given the current situation, we are providing analyses to monitor areas impacted by COVID-19, such as new patient volume, transition to Telehealth services and potential delays in claims processing and payments. At MWI, our team recognized that the need for veterinarian practices to virtually engage with their client has become critically important. In response, the business announced a series of technology tools to provide improved remote communication and enable curbside operations for practices and their patients. These examples illustrate a core strength for AmerisourceBergen. Our talent, expertise and resources facilitate our ability to provide comprehensive solutions.
Finally, AmerisourceBergen continues to be a strong corporate steward with a focus on advancing talent and culture and maintaining strong financial health. Our talent and culture have been on full display in these recent weeks, delivering unparalleled value for all our stakeholders. We have heard from individuals across the organization that they are proud to work for a company like AmerisourceBergen, with our priority on our purpose and values, especially during times of great societal need.
At the same time, the financial health of the organization remains unchanged, with one of the strongest balance sheets in company history and a continued focus on cash flow generation. This financial stability and strength provides AmerisourceBergen with the flexibility and firepower to navigate the current environment effectively and continue to deploy capital appropriately in order to provide long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and revised outlook for fiscal 2020. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
Before I discuss our second quarter financial results and revised outlook for the second half of the year, I want to first take a moment to reflect on AmerisourceBergen and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In February, I reached my 5-year mark with the company. And over these past several weeks, I have never been prouder to be part of AmerisourceBergen. On our November earnings call, I said the associates, businesses and culture across AmerisourceBergen are fundamental to our success and to the incredible value proposition we deliver for our manufacturer and provider partners. While I did not know then the unprecedented circumstances we find ourselves in now, the fundamental truth remains unchanged. AmerisourceBergen's talent, purpose and businesses have the company and our partners well positioned to navigate new challenges and increased complexity. The vital access we enable and solutions we provide have taken center stage as healthcare has never been more important and the need for efficiency and stability so paramount. Our purpose and our culture are guiding our company and I feel privileged to be a part of it.
We have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has prioritized internal investment before all other capital deployment. Steve already detailed many of the investments that we are benefiting from now. So I will simply say that the results validate the investments in our businesses. The infrastructure tools, resources and talent that AmerisourceBergen has amassed enables our robust business continuity plans to ensure continued patient access.
Turning now to discuss our financial results and expectations. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will quickly cover our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance, and second, I will cover the revision to our fiscal 2020 guidance. Given the current environment, I will focus much of my commentary on quantitative and qualitative color that is valuable in understanding the various impacts of COVID-19.
Beginning with our second quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, an increase of 14%, primarily due to higher operating income and, to a lesser extent, a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue was $47.4 billion, up over 9%, driven by strong revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health Group. Gross profit increased 7% or $99 million to $1.4 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% to $745 million. While operating expense growth in the quarter was driven by the timing of certain onetime items, we expect full year fiscal 2020 operating expense growth to be in the low single-digit range. Consolidated operating income was $672 million, up 9%, with our operating margin flat to the prior year quarter.
As I noted in January, the March 2020 quarter benefited from the removal of PharMEDium from our adjusted results after the January decision to permanently exit the business, which incurred $14 million of operating losses in the prior year March quarter. Operating income still would have grown nearly 7% without that year-over-year comparison tailwind. Net interest expense decreased $9 million to $34 million. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 continues to have a favorable impact on the interest expense line.
We have benefited from interest income on higher-than-expected cash balances in the first half of the year. Given the recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, we do not expect to have as significant of a benefit from interest income. Looking at the balance of the year, we expect quarterly net interest expense to be relatively in line with the March quarter.
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21.5%, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207 million shares. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares. 
Regarding free cash flow and our cash balance, fiscal year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow of $910 million, putting us right on track with our guidance for full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, of which $435 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $46 billion, up 9%. This segment continued to benefit from growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong growth in specialty distribution and overall market growth. In the quarter, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. However, we also incurred elevated operating expenses, and consequently, there was no significant impact to operating income.  Segment operating income increased about 9% to $563 million. We continued to benefit from our leading specialty physician services businesses and maintaining a strong portfolio of distribution customer relationships.
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13%, with all 3 operating segments delivering double-digit growth. The group had operating income of $108 million, up 8%, primarily driven by gross profit growth at MWI and World Courier, offset in part by higher operating expenses. 
This completes the review of our second quarter results so I will now turn to our revised fiscal 2020 guidance.
As we said in this morning's press release, we are lowering our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.35 to $7.65, down from the previous range of $7.55 to $7.80. And normally, after the execution and performance of our businesses in the first half, we would be raising our full year guidance. However, given these unprecedented times, we must revise guidance to reflect the potential impacts of COVID-19 for the second half of the year. 
As we look at the second half of the year, the main factors impacting the range of potential outcomes for the year is the magnitude and duration of patient disruption. We have analyzed and probability weighted the potential COVID-19 related impacts on our various business units. Overall, we feel strongly that the current disruption is manageable for AmerisourceBergen and our businesses are resilient. We are also monitoring weekly volume trends to understand business and product mix impacts. April trends provide some insight and were encouraging, with sales growth overall for our full line distribution and oncology. 
Our non-oncology physician business saw significant weekly sales decline year-over-year in the beginning of April, but those declines began to soften towards the end of the month. We anticipate that for the physician class of trade, delays in diagnoses and necessary testing will delay future sales of physician-administered pharmaceuticals. 
Additionally, certain of our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, in particular, MWI, will be impacted by lower volumes.
Overall, our revised guidance factors in a double-digit adjusted EPS decline in the third quarter, some of which is related to the March pull-forward of Pharmaceutical sales that I called out earlier, and then a return to EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Factors that move us within our guidance range include the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts on our businesses and also the speed of the rebound of our businesses. Factors that are not incorporated into our guidance range, because we do not currently expect these factors to occur, include a higher magnitude impact of COVID-19 on our businesses throughout our full fourth quarter and any significant bad debt expense beyond current assumptions. 
The resulting full year guidance ranges are: revenue in the low- to mid- single digit percent growth range; operating income, both at the consolidated level and pharmaceutical distribution, to be in the low to mid-single-digit percent growth range; operating income for Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, is now expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range.
Finally, given the share buyback so far this year, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to between 206 million and 207 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 208 million shares for the year. There is no change to our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020. The health of our cash flow and balance sheet supports AmerisourceBergen's ability to focus on ensuring continued patient access to care.
In closing, there is still much that remains to be learned as the country, states, businesses and individuals contemplate the appropriate path forward. But hopefully, you will appreciate the guidance update and additional color as we seek to enhance transparency and communication, especially in this unprecedented environment. AmerisourceBergen is focused on doing what is best, protecting and supporting our associates, providing key services and solutions to our partners to enable continued patient access and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. We are well positioned by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy with deep strategic relationships across our company and significant financial strength. And importantly, we are guided by our purpose, driven by our talent and culture and positively differentiated by our businesses and our customers.
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back over to Steve."

Our commitment to the health of our associates and communities influences every decision we make and has served as a vital guide as the world around us continues to change. The past several weeks have been a period of disruption for the world and has brought many challenges.

But generally speaking, if you can talk about trends there, any trends that you're seeing shifts? I think one of the concerns in the market is that if we do see more people getting prescriptions delivered to the home, what does that mean for the margins on that business for home delivery with PBMs for mail order versus coming into the pharmacy. 
And then how do we think about specialty trends? Again, you talked about oncology coming back. As we think about April, non-oncology is still weak. But what's your anticipation there as we start to think about things like telemedicine, virtual care visits, as this world starts to change with COVID-19.
I know that's a lot to kind of break down there, but I just want to really understand how you think about the trends going forward."

We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, I was still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end",709,"Yes. Lisa, thank you. We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, I was still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end of May in person. I was reluctant to change it to a virtual meeting. So there's no doubt that this has been more sustained, more serious than anything we faced -- the society in recent memory, which you don't need me to punt on. We have more than enough people are parting on that. I think in healthcare, look, prescriptions are the most efficient form of healthcare. They've proven to be very resilient. Patients want to continue to take their prescriptions. So we start with that, that's a really good business. Some of the trends, obviously, it's been difficult for people to get to physicians' offices. I think it's been somewhat interesting. A friend of mine, who is a cardiologist, said, people are willing to go to the grocery store, but they're not willing to come visit me when they have a serious issue, and that led to much more serious issues. So I think there's been -- when I think about reopening, I hope that the first thing people will do is go back to their physicians' offices, their dentists, their physical therapists, this is what they should be thinking about getting back to health and wellness as a priority. 
But a couple of trends. Microsoft said on their earnings call that they've -- 2 years, they've experienced 2 years of digital acceleration in 2 months. I think in Telehealth, I've heard it described as 10 years of acceptance. Having said that, post COVID, there will be much more restrictions, for example, on Telehealth from one state to another. But we can expect that trend. I think that generally that e-commerce as opposed to regular mail order is going to be much more important. And we'll be thinking about that as part of digital acceleration. So we'll be thinking about that, I talk about for -- the 3 pillars of AmerisourceBergen: community pharmacy, community veterinarians, community oncologists and physicians, specialty physicians. We'll be thinking about how to assist all of them with that digital transformation. In fact, our strategy groups, some of the smartest people in the company, we've been thinking through that, and we're getting ready for that. And that's part of the comment about AmerisourceBergen being better prepared when we come out of this crisis, we'll be well positioned, as well positioned as we were going into it. 
I think you also need to look at our diverse customer base. We are represented with anchor customers in every segment. And so we do benefit. Yes, I will admit, of course, that, of course, it's a high-margin business for us, the community pharmacy business than shipping to 100 mail order sites. Of course, that's true, and there's different working capital metrics associated with that. But we don't expect a very significant trend to occur once things emerge. We do think, again, that it's very important to bring those customers into e-commerce. On specialty, we have seen some patient -- new patient starts slow down. We've even seen some very specialized medicines in some of the basic medical business slowdown. But we do believe, and I think with a lot of logic and experience, that those will be some of the first prescriptions and the first visits to come back, as I referenced. 
Oncology is holding up well. Again, the softness has really been related to lower new patients. The longer the restrictions continue, we would expect further weakness or if there's a reemergence of hotspots in certain areas. The hospitals, we believe, are continuing to resume to normal operations, and that will be a positive trend for us. And a pathology report has been a key gating factor towards getting new diagnosis for oncology and we believe all of those areas are starting to open up. So I've rambled on quite a lot of chat. I'm sure we're going to get to some more questions, but excellent question, Lisa, and good to hear your voice.
Thank you."

Obviously, there's been an impact. As you guys have highlighted and we've seen in the marketplace, the specialist oncologists has not been -- the visits there have not been immune, clearly, to the pandemic. Any sense you can give us on how those scripts have trended, specifically relative to the broader prescription market? And then I know you said you expect the channel to be down, but can you give us any more on the order of magnitude and maybe timing of how prolonged do you think the weakness could be within the specialty channel?"

Our phys",347,"Yes. I mean I -- as I -- Bob, hope you're doing well. So referrals have been impacted and patient visits at some specialty practices, as I mentioned, have been working through essentially the limitations of operating in a social distancing world. Our physicians have, as we understand, started using Telehealth as much as possible, and also they've had to use no waiting rooms, texting people to come upstairs for visits, et cetera. So everyone had to adapt to the new order and, again, we anticipate that would carry on for a couple more weeks or a couple more months. And of course, lower visits and delay in pathology reports, et cetera, and new diagnoses has led to a mix of some lost sales. And -- but we do believe it also will lead and has led to pent-up demand. 
So when you think about complex illnesses, the therapy is extremely valuable, life-saving to those patients, and we expect that, that will be the first to resume and there will be a real pent-up demand. And those physicians are going to be kind of analogous to the ER physicians. They're going to have to keep working around the clock literally to keep up, I think, once everyone feels safe to go back to the offices. And also, we think that it will vary by state, as certain states reopen or certain states have less hotspots areas. So we are a national business, so we'll see that resume.
And of course, it goes without saying that people with critical illnesses need to be examined, referred and treated by the specialists. Oncology has been holding up relatively well, probably because those patients who were under treatment are continuing their treatment. Ophthalmology has been under pressure. We're starting to see some trends of normalizing or stability. And again, I talked about the pathology reports and the hospitals being able to return. So an increased availability of testing would allow for a more capable operating environment for physicians.
So I hope that gets your question, Bob. Jim has a comment, please?"

But we did see those sales declines moderate towards the end of the month. And of course, we don't want to put -- overly emphasize a single week or a single month, but I think that those additional numbers and trends are helpful to think about."

Well, that ended up being very true, right? That is what you're worried about was regulation and reimbursement, and it became much more apparent over my tenure than over his.
But the other thing I think is that we say, which is really happens to be true, is our first priority is internal investments. Jim has really detailed how important those investments in IT, infrastructure, distribution, business continuity plan has been incredibly fortuitous, productive for our businesses. And I would say that the other thing that we've invested in a lot is communications and culture. And maybe that's not something that is communicable that well to investors. But it's been incredibly important. The constant communication we've had to our people has been one of the best investments that we've had throughout this period. And that's because we have quite a great intranet site and we have had the ability to have 70% of our associates working at home, but still be able to support them. And we have had town hall meetings where we have over 6,000 people. So I think that's very important.
As far as M&A goes, we always are open to look at it. We haven't seen the value offer there. A lot of our interest in M&A has been in the commercialization services area. We've -- that is very much we need really good technology, good people, good customer bases. And we literally think that when we look at acquisitions, they should be additive to our own businesses and at least equal policy. And we often just don't see that. And then the PE market has been very, very robust. So that's just hasn't been [ anything ].
I'll hand over to Jim because you asked a broad question. But now let me just say on opioid litigation. We have been busy with the pandemic. So there's essentially no substantive update. And we remain very focused on the company's critical needs at this time, but we do believe that the global settlement that has been offered is one that should be taken very seriously. And we hope that -- we hope that the necessary parties will see that the merits of the potential global framework, and we'll continue our efforts on that front.

Let me start, and I'll address the question you had, the extensive question you had on our Other segment. And what we indicated today is that for the segment, for the fiscal year, we're expecting the decline of operating income to be in the low single-digit percent range for the fiscal year. And the 2 largest businesses in the Other segment are MWI and World Courier. So I'll really kind of focus my remarks there. And MWI had a really strong quarter. We disclosed the revenues in the Q. Revenue growth was 10%, strong operating income growth during the quarter. It's really well positioned. But the animal health market will be impacted by COVID-19 and MWI will be impacted.
Companion animal vet visits are impacted by social distancing. Production animal will be impacted by substantially reduced sales of protein to restaurants and hotels and also be impacted by some supply chain issues due to closed packing plants. I think probably companion animal will come back quicker than production animals. And -- but both markets will come back and be strong. And MWI is really well positioned in the market. Steve talked in his prepared remarks about some of the technology things MWI is doing. And when that market comes back, MWI will be as strong or stronger than ever. 
Very quickly on World Courier. It's a really interesting case study. If we had looked back a couple of months ago, we would have thought the World Courier would have been one of our businesses most impacted by the onset of COVID-19 because of its international presence, whether it be in China or South Korea or Italy or any of the other countries where it operates. So what we found is that something we always knew that World Courier really excels by managing complexity for manufacturers. And so what we're seeing is World Courier, while number of shipments might be down, weight's up, the shipments to in-home settings is up. And as we look at World Courier today, the impacts of COVID-19, we think -- well, the impact or the impacts will be significantly less than what we would have thought of a couple of months ago.
With regard to the rest of the businesses in the group, there will be some impact in consulting, but like the rest of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, they're resilient and will be very manageable."

And to provide a little bit more detail there, we established a incremental bad debt reserve of $19 million in the March quarter related to the onset of COVID-19. And it's not related to any specific customers, but we did consider the credit environment and financial strength of customers. So that's really what caused there to be a revenue in TP pull forward, but not an impact to operating income. And then there were some other smaller costs in the March quarter, which had to do with, like important things such as IT, work-from-home enablement, bonuses for frontline distribution center associates, cleaning supplies and services.

As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us,",1505,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. As you saw from our earnings release, AmerisourceBergen delivered excellent performance for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. With a strong first half of the year behind us, I will focus this morning's call on 2 main areas. First, we will discuss AmerisourceBergen's actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and second, we will talk about how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long-term for our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and our communities. Jim will then discuss our results in more detail and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
First, with regard to the actions we have taken in response to the COVID 2019 dynamic. I've never been prouder of AmerisourceBergen and our associates. We have been guided by our purpose and values, and the company has prioritized supporting the safety of our associates. In turn, our associates have been innovating in helping our manufacturer and provider customers navigate new or intensified challenges. The health, safety and well-being of our associates is paramount, and we have taken several steps to support our frontline associates, which have included, enhanced cleaning protocols and additional support from third-party cleaners, enhanced paid time-off for associates needing to quarantine or care for family members, weekly bonuses for frontline associates and backup dependent care. These measures are important in protecting and supporting our associates and key to AmerisourceBergen's ability to support the foundational elements of healthcare. As you can imagine, the necessity of our services and solutions has been highlighted and amplified as manufacturers and providers navigate increased complexity and new challenges.
To help efficiently and effectively address these challenges head on, we established an internal response task force that is made up of key experts and leaders across the company. Our task force has been advising individual teams and leaders and also meets with government officials. Task force help us move quickly to implement our business continuity plans, which are enabled by the robustness of our distribution network, technology and the talent and innovation of our associates. 
The strength of our infrastructure has enhanced our ability to provide patients access to the medications they need. AmerisourceBergen has a history of investing in our businesses and capabilities, giving us significant technological and operational flexibility. Last month, we demonstrated this when we temporarily closed one of our largest distribution centers out of an abundance of caution, given its proximity to a COVID-19 hot spot. We invoked our business continuity plan for the region and seamlessly transferred volume to other AmerisourceBergen distribution centers. We used the temporary closure to perform extensive sanitation measures at the location. AmerisourceBergen also moved decisively to protect non frontline associates. We were able to quickly shift all suitable roles to working remotely. This important distancing measure was achieved as a result of close leadership collaboration and strong IT infrastructure.  The types of proactive measures would not be possible without the significant investments we have made in our distribution center, network and technology. 
On the pharmaceutical supply side, our sourcing and commercial teams have worked diligently to ensure that we are understanding demand and forecasting sustainability of supply to maintain the necessary inventory to address varying needs.  We have made it a priority to keep in regular communication with all stakeholders to best maintain continuity of supply and meet increased demand from providers. This has been a period when alignment and coordination is vital. And we have amplified our proactive approach to communications and engagements. Our teams have held numerous customer virtual town halls in order to discuss factors influencing the supply chain, outline our response and business continuity and articulate the resources available to our customers. These events have facilitated reach to thousands of participants, and are a good example of AmerisourceBergen's calm, transparent and patient-focused response. 
Despite these uncertain times, I have been inspired daily by the dedication, innovation and thoughtfulness displayed by AmerisourceBergen associates. We have seen firsthand the importance of our purpose-driven organization, especially given the vital role AmerisourceBergen plays in the healthcare system. It is times like these that reinforce our confidence in AmerisourceBergen's strategic position, resiliency and ability to provide critical services and solutions in any economic climate.
Over the years, we have focused much of our time with investors and analysts on providing visibility into AmerisourceBergen's 4 strategic pillars. While the world around us has changed the way we are now working, the way we connect and the way we communicate, the key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart remain a constant. Let me remind you of them and why they underscore our confidence in our strategic positioning. 
First, we have a diverse portfolio of customers with key anchor relationships in each segment. We have built and nurtured long-standing and collaborative partners with a diverse group of customers, ranging from community and national retailers to health systems and community physicians. An example from one of these customer groups is our Good Neighbor Pharmacy, where members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need even when things are at their most chaotic. Whether by creating care packages for at-risk customers, providing drive-through services, to making hand sanitizer or keeping in touch with patients via social media, our independent pharmacy partners have done an exemplary job of showcasing the crucial part they play in improving community health. These types of relationships enable us to capitalize on pharmaceutical utilization in the United States across a variety of settings and distribution channels.
Second, we maintain market-leading positions in specialty distribution and services, where pharmaceutical innovation and demographic trends will continue to drive long-term growth. During this period of social distancing, we've been working with our provider customers to help them navigate the complexity of operating in this environment, understanding that there are some natural delays in patients seeing doctors for necessary referrals. We believe the ability -- the availability of testing and improved operability of practices will enable these practices to serve more efficiently  the complex needs of their new and existing patients. 
We have worked closely with our community physician practices to provide advanced analytics to help them navigate the temporary slowdown in patient visits due to social distancing. At the same time, our commercialization teams are working closely with their manufacturer partners to support efforts to ensure patients continue to be able to access vital pharmaceutical therapies. 
Our Lash business has been supporting our partners program that helps eligible unemployed patients maintain access to therapy despite loss of health insurance due to COVID-19. Additionally, World Courier's capability to provide direct-to-patient clinical trial services has been a key asset in supporting the shift of healthcare out of hospitals and into the home, thereby lowering the burden on hospitals and pharmacies. As complexity increases, World Courier thrives as its capabilities are unparalleled in its market.
Navigating complexity is a foundational trait of AmerisourceBergen, and it powers our third key differentiator, our ability to provide innovative services and solutions. We proactively invest and innovate to be best-in-class partners, as evidenced by the foresight that guided us to dedicate capital expenditures in our distribution center network, IT capabilities and specialized customer-focused solutions. One such example is a tool we are using to provide the advanced analytics for our community physician customers. Physician practices are leveraging our strategic financial intelligence solution, Infodat, to monitor and evaluate potential areas of concern. Given the current situation, we are providing analyses to monitor areas impacted by COVID-19, such as new patient volume, transition to Telehealth services and potential delays in claims processing and payments. At MWI, our team recognized that the need for veterinarian practices to virtually engage with their client has become critically important. In response, the business announced a series of technology tools to provide improved remote communication and enable curbside operations for practices and their patients. These examples illustrate a core strength for AmerisourceBergen. Our talent, expertise and resources facilitate our ability to provide comprehensive solutions.
Finally, AmerisourceBergen continues to be a strong corporate steward with a focus on advancing talent and culture and maintaining strong financial health. Our talent and culture have been on full display in these recent weeks, delivering unparalleled value for all our stakeholders. We have heard from individuals across the organization that they are proud to work for a company like AmerisourceBergen, with our priority on our purpose and values, especially during times of great societal need.
At the same time, the financial health of the organization remains unchanged, with one of the strongest balance sheets in company history and a continued focus on cash flow generation. This financial stability and strength provides AmerisourceBergen with the flexibility and firepower to navigate the current environment effectively and continue to deploy capital appropriately in order to provide long-term value for all our stakeholders.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results and revised outlook for fiscal 2020. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year March quarter, unless otherwise noted. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
Before I discuss our second quarter financial results and revised outlook for the second half of the year, I want to first take a moment to reflect on AmerisourceBergen and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In February, I reached my 5-year mark with the company. And over these past several weeks, I have never been prouder to be part of AmerisourceBergen. On our November earnings call, I said the associates, businesses and culture across AmerisourceBergen are fundamental to our success and to the incredible value proposition we deliver for our manufacturer and provider partners. While I did not know then the unprecedented circumstances we find ourselves in now, the fundamental truth remains unchanged. AmerisourceBergen's talent, purpose and businesses have the company and our partners well positioned to navigate new challenges and increased complexity. The vital access we enable and solutions we provide have taken center stage as healthcare has never been more important and the need for efficiency and stability so paramount. Our purpose and our culture are guiding our company and I feel privileged to be a part of it.
We have been able to leverage significant internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our upstream and downstream partners. Over the years, AmerisourceBergen has prioritized internal investment before all other capital deployment. Steve already detailed many of the investments that we are benefiting from now. So I will simply say that the results validate the investments in our businesses. The infrastructure tools, resources and talent that AmerisourceBergen has amassed enables our robust business continuity plans to ensure continued patient access.
Turning now to discuss our financial results and expectations. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will quickly cover our adjusted quarterly consolidated and segment performance, and second, I will cover the revision to our fiscal 2020 guidance. Given the current environment, I will focus much of my commentary on quantitative and qualitative color that is valuable in understanding the various impacts of COVID-19.
Beginning with our second quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.40, an increase of 14%, primarily due to higher operating income and, to a lesser extent, a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue was $47.4 billion, up over 9%, driven by strong revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health Group. Gross profit increased 7% or $99 million to $1.4 billion. Consolidated operating expenses increased 6% to $745 million. While operating expense growth in the quarter was driven by the timing of certain onetime items, we expect full year fiscal 2020 operating expense growth to be in the low single-digit range. Consolidated operating income was $672 million, up 9%, with our operating margin flat to the prior year quarter.
As I noted in January, the March 2020 quarter benefited from the removal of PharMEDium from our adjusted results after the January decision to permanently exit the business, which incurred $14 million of operating losses in the prior year March quarter. Operating income still would have grown nearly 7% without that year-over-year comparison tailwind. Net interest expense decreased $9 million to $34 million. The adoption of the new lease accounting standard in fiscal 2020 continues to have a favorable impact on the interest expense line.
We have benefited from interest income on higher-than-expected cash balances in the first half of the year. Given the recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, we do not expect to have as significant of a benefit from interest income. Looking at the balance of the year, we expect quarterly net interest expense to be relatively in line with the March quarter.
Moving now to income taxes. Our adjusted income tax rate was 21.5%, flat compared to the prior year quarter. Our diluted share count decreased 3% to 207 million shares. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately $400 million of our shares. 
Regarding free cash flow and our cash balance, fiscal year-to-date, we had adjusted free cash flow of $910 million, putting us right on track with our guidance for full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash, of which $435 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings.
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, segment revenue was $46 billion, up 9%. This segment continued to benefit from growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong growth in specialty distribution and overall market growth. In the quarter, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their purchases at the onset of COVID-19, resulting in higher revenue and gross profit. However, we also incurred elevated operating expenses, and consequently, there was no significant impact to operating income.  Segment operating income increased about 9% to $563 million. We continued to benefit from our leading specialty physician services businesses and maintaining a strong portfolio of distribution customer relationships.
I will now turn to the Other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI. In the quarter, total revenue was $1.9 billion, up 13%, with all 3 operating segments delivering double-digit growth. The group had operating income of $108 million, up 8%, primarily driven by gross profit growth at MWI and World Courier, offset in part by higher operating expenses. 
This completes the review of our second quarter results so I will now turn to our revised fiscal 2020 guidance.
As we said in this morning's press release, we are lowering our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.35 to $7.65, down from the previous range of $7.55 to $7.80. And normally, after the execution and performance of our businesses in the first half, we would be raising our full year guidance. However, given these unprecedented times, we must revise guidance to reflect the potential impacts of COVID-19 for the second half of the year. 
As we look at the second half of the year, the main factors impacting the range of potential outcomes for the year is the magnitude and duration of patient disruption. We have analyzed and probability weighted the potential COVID-19 related impacts on our various business units. Overall, we feel strongly that the current disruption is manageable for AmerisourceBergen and our businesses are resilient. We are also monitoring weekly volume trends to understand business and product mix impacts. April trends provide some insight and were encouraging, with sales growth overall for our full line distribution and oncology. 
Our non-oncology physician business saw significant weekly sales decline year-over-year in the beginning of April, but those declines began to soften towards the end of the month. We anticipate that for the physician class of trade, delays in diagnoses and necessary testing will delay future sales of physician-administered pharmaceuticals. 
Additionally, certain of our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, in particular, MWI, will be impacted by lower volumes.
Overall, our revised guidance factors in a double-digit adjusted EPS decline in the third quarter, some of which is related to the March pull-forward of Pharmaceutical sales that I called out earlier, and then a return to EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Factors that move us within our guidance range include the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts on our businesses and also the speed of the rebound of our businesses. Factors that are not incorporated into our guidance range, because we do not currently expect these factors to occur, include a higher magnitude impact of COVID-19 on our businesses throughout our full fourth quarter and any significant bad debt expense beyond current assumptions. 
The resulting full year guidance ranges are: revenue in the low- to mid- single digit percent growth range; operating income, both at the consolidated level and pharmaceutical distribution, to be in the low to mid-single-digit percent growth range; operating income for Other, our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, is now expected to decline in the low single-digit percent range.
Finally, given the share buyback so far this year, we are lowering our expectation for weighted shares outstanding to between 206 million and 207 million shares, down from our previous expectation of approximately 208 million shares for the year. There is no change to our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020. The health of our cash flow and balance sheet supports AmerisourceBergen's ability to focus on ensuring continued patient access to care.
In closing, there is still much that remains to be learned as the country, states, businesses and individuals contemplate the appropriate path forward. But hopefully, you will appreciate the guidance update and additional color as we seek to enhance transparency and communication, especially in this unprecedented environment. AmerisourceBergen is focused on doing what is best, protecting and supporting our associates, providing key services and solutions to our partners to enable continued patient access and creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. We are well positioned by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy with deep strategic relationships across our company and significant financial strength. And importantly, we are guided by our purpose, driven by our talent and culture and positively differentiated by our businesses and our customers.
Thank you for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. Now I will turn the call back over to Steve."

Our commitment to the health of our associates and communities influences every decision we make and has served as a vital guide as the world around us continues to change. The past several weeks have been a period of disruption for the world and has brought many challenges.

But generally speaking, if you can talk about trends there, any trends that you're seeing shifts? I think one of the concerns in the market is that if we do see more people getting prescriptions delivered to the home, what does that mean for the margins on that business for home delivery with PBMs for mail order versus coming into the pharmacy. 
And then how do we think about specialty trends? Again, you talked about oncology coming back. As we think about April, non-oncology is still weak. But what's your anticipation there as we start to think about things like telemedicine, virtual care visits, as this world starts to change with COVID-19.
I know that's a lot to kind of break down there, but I just want to really understand how you think about the trends going forward."

We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, I was still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end",709,"Yes. Lisa, thank you. We must have been around a long time because you asked me most of our Q&A prepared in one question. But there's no doubt, look, I think when we started this, I was still hoping we could hold, for example, our Board meeting at the end of May in person. I was reluctant to change it to a virtual meeting. So there's no doubt that this has been more sustained, more serious than anything we faced -- the society in recent memory, which you don't need me to punt on. We have more than enough people are parting on that. I think in healthcare, look, prescriptions are the most efficient form of healthcare. They've proven to be very resilient. Patients want to continue to take their prescriptions. So we start with that, that's a really good business. Some of the trends, obviously, it's been difficult for people to get to physicians' offices. I think it's been somewhat interesting. A friend of mine, who is a cardiologist, said, people are willing to go to the grocery store, but they're not willing to come visit me when they have a serious issue, and that led to much more serious issues. So I think there's been -- when I think about reopening, I hope that the first thing people will do is go back to their physicians' offices, their dentists, their physical therapists, this is what they should be thinking about getting back to health and wellness as a priority. 
But a couple of trends. Microsoft said on their earnings call that they've -- 2 years, they've experienced 2 years of digital acceleration in 2 months. I think in Telehealth, I've heard it described as 10 years of acceptance. Having said that, post COVID, there will be much more restrictions, for example, on Telehealth from one state to another. But we can expect that trend. I think that generally that e-commerce as opposed to regular mail order is going to be much more important. And we'll be thinking about that as part of digital acceleration. So we'll be thinking about that, I talk about for -- the 3 pillars of AmerisourceBergen: community pharmacy, community veterinarians, community oncologists and physicians, specialty physicians. We'll be thinking about how to assist all of them with that digital transformation. In fact, our strategy groups, some of the smartest people in the company, we've been thinking through that, and we're getting ready for that. And that's part of the comment about AmerisourceBergen being better prepared when we come out of this crisis, we'll be well positioned, as well positioned as we were going into it. 
I think you also need to look at our diverse customer base. We are represented with anchor customers in every segment. And so we do benefit. Yes, I will admit, of course, that, of course, it's a high-margin business for us, the community pharmacy business than shipping to 100 mail order sites. Of course, that's true, and there's different working capital metrics associated with that. But we don't expect a very significant trend to occur once things emerge. We do think, again, that it's very important to bring those customers into e-commerce. On specialty, we have seen some patient -- new patient starts slow down. We've even seen some very specialized medicines in some of the basic medical business slowdown. But we do believe, and I think with a lot of logic and experience, that those will be some of the first prescriptions and the first visits to come back, as I referenced. 
Oncology is holding up well. Again, the softness has really been related to lower new patients. The longer the restrictions continue, we would expect further weakness or if there's a reemergence of hotspots in certain areas. The hospitals, we believe, are continuing to resume to normal operations, and that will be a positive trend for us. And a pathology report has been a key gating factor towards getting new diagnosis for oncology and we believe all of those areas are starting to open up. So I've rambled on quite a lot of chat. I'm sure we're going to get to some more questions, but excellent question, Lisa, and good to hear your voice.
Thank you."

So referrals have been impacted and patient visits at some specialty practices, as I mentioned, have been working through essentially the limitations of operating in a social distancing world. Our physicians have, as we understand, started using Telehealth as much as possible, and also they've had to use no waiting rooms, texting people to come upstairs for visits, et cetera. So everyone had to adapt to the new order and, again, we anticipate that would carry on for a couple more weeks or a couple more months. And of course, lower visits and delay in pathology reports, et cetera, and new diagnoses has led to a mix of some lost sales. And -- but we do believe it also will lead and has led to pent-up demand. 
So when you think about complex illnesses, the therapy is extremely valuable, life-saving to those patients, and we expect that, that will be the first to resume and there will be a real pent-up demand. And those physicians are going to be kind of analogous to the ER physicians. They're going to have to keep working around the clock literally to keep up, I think, once everyone feels safe to go back to the offices. And also, we think that it will vary by state, as certain states reopen or certain states have less hotspots areas. So we are a national business, so we'll see that resume.
And of course, it goes without saying that people with critical illnesses need to be examined, referred and treated by the specialists. Oncology has been holding up relatively well, probably because those patients who were under treatment are continuing their treatment. Ophthalmology has been under pressure. We're starting to see some trends of normalizing or stability. And again, I talked about the pathology reports and the hospitals being able to return. So an increased availability of testing would allow for a more capable operating environment for physicians.
So I hope that gets your question, Bob. Jim has a comment, please?"

And of course, we typically wouldn't talk about the most recent month on an earnings call, but given the current environment, we wanted to provide that additional color and clarity. And as I said and as Steve mentioned, during the month of April, oncology and the specialty physician market, we still saw solid growth and where we saw the decline within non-oncology physician specialty market, as Steve said, things like ophthalmology. But we did see those sales declines moderate towards the end of the month. And of course, we don't want to put -- overly emphasize a single week or a single month, but I think that those additional numbers and trends are helpful to think about."

Well, that ended up being very true, right? That is what you're worried about was regulation and reimbursement, and it became much more apparent over my tenure than over his.
But the other thing I think is that we say, which is really happens to be true, is our first priority is internal investments. Jim has really detailed how important those investments in IT, infrastructure, distribution, business continuity plan has been incredibly fortuitous, productive for our businesses. And I would say that the other thing that we've invested in a lot is communications and culture. And maybe that's not something that is communicable that well to investors. But it's been incredibly important. The constant communication we've had to our people has been one of the best investments that we've had throughout this period. And that's because we have quite a great intranet site and we have had the ability to have 70% of our associates working at home, but still be able to support them. And we have had town hall meetings where we have over 6,000 people. So I think that's very important.
As far as M&A goes, we always are open to look at it. We haven't seen the value offer there. A lot of our interest in M&A has been in the commercialization services area. We've -- that is very much we need really good technology, good people, good customer bases. And we literally think that when we look at acquisitions, they should be additive to our own businesses and at least equal policy. And we often just don't see that. And then the PE market has been very, very robust. So that's just hasn't been [ anything ].
I'll hand over to Jim because you asked a broad question. But now let me just say on opioid litigation. We have been busy with the pandemic. So there's essentially no substantive update. And we remain very focused on the company's critical needs at this time, but we do believe that the global settlement that has been offered is one that should be taken very seriously. And we hope that -- we hope that the necessary parties will see that the merits of the potential global framework, and we'll continue our efforts on that front.

And maybe globally, what are other countries doing in terms of how they are curtailing or modifying their guidelines for clinical trials? And is there any impact on the consulting side given that perhaps pharma's maybe a little bit more insulated from a direct impact from COVID?

Let me start, and I'll address the question you had, the extensive question you had on our Other segment. And what we indicated today is that for the segment, for the fiscal year, we're expecting the decline of operating income to be in the low single-digit percent range for the fiscal year. And the 2 largest businesses in the Other segment are MWI and World Courier. So I'll really kind of focus my remarks there. And MWI had a really strong quarter. We disclosed the revenues in the Q. Revenue growth was 10%, strong operating income growth during the quarter. It's really well positioned. But the animal health market will be impacted by COVID-19 and MWI will be impacted.
Companion animal vet visits are impacted by social distancing. Production animal will be impacted by substantially reduced sales of protein to restaurants and hotels and also be impacted by some supply chain issues due to closed packing plants. I think probably companion animal will come back quicker than production animals. And -- but both markets will come back and be strong. And MWI is really well positioned in the market. Steve talked in his prepared remarks about some of the technology things MWI is doing. And when that market comes back, MWI will be as strong or stronger than ever. 
Very quickly on World Courier. It's a really interesting case study. If we had looked back a couple of months ago, we would have thought the World Courier would have been one of our businesses most impacted by the onset of COVID-19 because of its international presence, whether it be in China or South Korea or Italy or any of the other countries where it operates. So what we found is that something we always knew that World Courier really excels by managing complexity for manufacturers. And so what we're seeing is World Courier, while number of shipments might be down, weight's up, the shipments to in-home settings is up. And as we look at World Courier today, the impacts of COVID-19, we think -- well, the impact or the impacts will be significantly less than what we would have thought of a couple of months ago.
With regard to the rest of the businesses in the group, there will be some impact in consulting, but like the rest of AmerisourceBergen's businesses, they're resilient and will be very manageable."

And -- but we also indicated that we had elevated costs, so there was not an operating income impact or at least there wasn't a significant operating income impact. And to provide a little bit more detail there, we established a incremental bad debt reserve of $19 million in the March quarter related to the onset of COVID-19. And it's not related to any specific customers, but we did consider the credit environment and financial strength of customers. So that's really what caused there to be a revenue in TP pull forward, but not an impact to operating income. And then there were some other smaller costs in the March quarter, which had to do with, like important things such as IT, work-from-home enablement, bonuses for frontline distribution center associates, cleaning supplies and services. And so for all those reasons, there was a pull-through of revenue income, gross profit, but not a significant impact on operating income during the quarter."

Second, I'll discuss how Amerisourcebergen is positioned to deliver value over the long term. For our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities we serve. 
As we shared last quarter, the health, safety and well-being of our associates continues to be our top priority. We have taken a number of steps to support our associates, particularly those on the front line, guided by our purpose and value at every turn. We have prioritized the safety of our associates. We have continued to work diligently to facilitate patient access, supporting our manufacturer and provider customer as well as navigating these challenging times. I remain incredibly proud of the work our associates are undertaking across all areas of our business. 
As I discussed on our earnings call last November, our talent is one of Amerisourcebergen's biggest competitive advantages. Our associates power our culture and are driven by our purpose. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, and this is demonstrated across the entire organization. We know the experience of our associates is enhanced when they believe in the values and purposes of their employer. And as a company, we have prioritized this by focusing on talent development, career growth and diversity initiatives. 
In May, Amerisourcebergen was named a diversity Inc. noteworthy company for the fourth consecutive year due to our hiring, retention and promotion of women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people and veterans. While I'm proud that Amerisourcebergen has been recognized for our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are committed to fostering an even more diverse and inclusive workforce. We are dedicated to growing, learning and shaping our approach to diversity and inclusion for the betterment of our workforce and the communities we serve. With this in mind, we took time over the past several weeks to discuss social injustice in racial and equity and fostered a candid dialogue to discuss topics, including racism and unconscious bias. We facilitated all associate turmoils with black leaders and other leaders of color volunteered to share their insights and personal experiences in dealing with discrimination and systemic racism. These discussions are somewhat difficult are a necessary step to faster true change. 
We recognize this is an ongoing effort, and we are committed to continuous improvement. There is significant intrinsic value created for all our stakeholders by having a strong culture and diversity that mirrors society as a whole. I look forward to sharing more about the progress we are making in this important area in the quarters to come. 
Now turning to our results. The June quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our business as we successfully managed through the new challenges across the global health care system. The supply chain has become the invisible pillar of medical innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amerisourcebergen and our industry as a whole have become understood for what we truly are. A strategic asset as awareness has been heightened around the importance of pharmaceutical security, channel data and sustainability of supply. Amerisourcebergen is taking this opportunity to deepen our relationship with our partners and expand on our value proposition as we continue to execute on our pharmaceutical centric strategy. The 4 key differentiators that serve as pillars of our company, continue to position us for continued value creation. 
First, our broad and strategic relationships provides stability and partnerships with key customers in each segment of the health care system. Members of our good neighbor pharmacy network demonstrated the essential roles they play within their communities during these difficult times. Thousands of independent pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and start members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need, even when things are at their most chaotic. They have all adapted at lightning speed to combat the pandemic and serve the communities in new and inventive ways, whether through delivering care packages to the immunocompromised or offering a meal to those who lost their jobs during this crisis. 
Independent pharmacies have supported patients while maintaining the highest level of customer service. We are proud to partner with these frontline health care providers to deliver care to those who need it most. 
Second, we continue to build on our leadership position in specialty distribution and services. Our industry-leading specialty distribution businesses have AmerisourceBergen positioned to leverage our relationships and expertise in a key part of the market. We continue to see increased biosimilar utilization, particularly in oncology, where our Ion business differentiates our value proposition for both our provider customers and manufacturer partners. The growth we are seeing in biosimilars uptake is encouraging for the future, not only for AmerisourceBergen but for patient access and the U.S. health care system overall. 
On the distribution side, we've been working closely with our provider customers as they take the necessary actions to improve operability. 
Community-based practices have adapted to continue treating patients through telehealth visits and by implementing new safety protocols to treat the most critical cases in the office. 
In order to minimize patient care disruption, health care providers have implemented new distancing protocols, enhanced office cleaning procedures and acquired additional PPE for staff. The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer on the past few months, have further illustrated the vital role of specialty practices in the treatment of critically ill patients in controlled environments. Patients are clearly aware of specialty physician practices ability to provide safe, effective and convenient treatment at a time when health and well-being have never been so important. 
I mentioned last quarter that the initial restrictive measures negatively impacted necessary patient access to things such as screenings and testing. As the country continues to navigate the complexities of this pandemic, it is vital that care is not deferred. Providers are more equipped to operate in the current environment to the benefit of the health and well-being of all patients. 
Third, Amerisourcebergen associates continue to focus on providing innovative services and solutions for our partners in the health care system to navigate these challenging times. Amerisourcebergen is uniquely positioned to help our customers in the current environment and is focused on providing them with important resources. 
For example, our sourcing and distribution teams are leveraging our commercial expertise and data and analytics capabilities to provide manufacturing and government entities with actionable channel insights. We are able to provide significant transparency into the pharmaceutical supply chain and related end markets, which is an important resource as stakeholders seek to be fully informed by data as they face new challenges. 
Amerisourcebergen is focused on being solutions-oriented and continuing to identify ways to add value, particularly at this time of heightened focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
And at our MWI Animal Health business, we announced 2 new offerings designed to help veterinarians manage the financial impact of COVID-19. The offerings allow practices to provide flexible financing solutions for clients who may be struggling to afford quality care for them or we may just find more certainty in an uncertain economic landscape. The offering speeds the financial burden of both routine and emergency pet care, while also helping practices achieve more consistent revenue, long-term client engagement and most importantly, better outcomes for their patients. 
Finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. We continue to focus on strong corporate stewardship in order to create value for all our stakeholders. 
In addition to some of the initiatives I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation brought together more than 60 nonprofit partners and peers during the virtual conference to facilitate collaboration, share best practices and learn from one another. We've been focused on developing strategies to address some of the most difficult issues affecting society today, including pandemic resilience, social justice and racial equality, health and community improvement. Amerisourcebergen is committed to strong corporate citizenship and continuous improvement. We are driven by our talent and culture, differentiated by our robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services and United in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our values, strategic partnerships and market leadership position Amerisourcebergen to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. 
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our third quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. 
As we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, I can say without hesitation that I have been profoundly impressed by the execution and dedication across AmerisourceBergen as our businesses have proven resilient as we continue our central work of enabling patient access. 
I am even more proud of the engagement and commitment by our associates and leaders as we come together to address systematic racism and commit to progressing towards equality and justice in everything we do. The actions we are taking to improve diversity, equity and inclusion will make AmerisourceBergen an even better company. 
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning. First, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. Second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. 
Moving now to our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85, an increase of 5% primarily due to solid operating income slightly above prior year, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and operating income were each up only slightly as the timing of COVID-related impacts dampened our growth rates in the June quarter. 
Rather than spending time discussing these small year-over-year increases at the consolidated level, I will instead focus on the segment level items and provide incremental color in the guidance section. 
Net interest expense increased $2 million to $38 million primarily due to a decrease in interest income, resulting principally from a decline in investment interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, we expect our fourth quarter net interest expense to be in line with the third quarter. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 18.8%, down from 21% in the prior year quarter due to a benefit resulting from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count declined 3% to 205.5 million shares primarily due to share repurchases, net of stock option 
exercises. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, year-to-date, our adjusted free cash flow was $715 million. Our cash flow guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged as we expect the fourth quarter will generate meaningful cash flow. 
We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash of which $490 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. 
This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results. 
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution services. Segment revenue was $43.6 billion up only slightly due to the increased March quarter customer purchases associated with the onset of COVID-19, which resulted in fewer purchases in the June quarter. Segment operating income increased about 3.6% to $427 million with our operating income margin up 3 basis points as we benefited from lower administrative expenses and higher gross profit. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had a $9 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharmeDium business. 
While the timing and complexity of the impact of COVID-19 somewhat distorts the comparability of our numbers this quarter it is abundantly clear that our pharmaceutical center strategy, deep relationships, talented associates and leading businesses have enabled Amerisourcebergen's resilience. 
The teams and associates across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses have done commendable work to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, ensuring safe and secure patient access to pharmaceuticals and supporting the evolving needs of our manufacturer and provider partners. 
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, including World Courier, Amerisourcebergen Consulting and MWI. 
In the quarter, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4% primarily due to growth at our Consulting Group and World Courier. Operating income for the group declined by $12 million or 13% primarily due to impacts from COVID-19 at our MWI business. In May, we called out expected volume pressure for our MWI business associated with COVID-19-related impacts. 
During the June quarter, we saw MWI's Companion Animals business rebound very well as that fit is normalized. However, MWI's Production Animal business stepped down meaningfully in April and again in May and then leveled off. The Production Animal business continued to see pressure stemming from a decline in food service demand. 
This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range from $7.35 to $7.65 to our new guidance range of $7.80 to $7.95 as AmerisourceBergen's business has proven even more resilient than we had incorporated into our previous range. 
When we provided our guidance back in May, we anticipated that June quarter EPS would decline due to the March pull forward of pharmaceutical sales and negative COVID-19-related impacts on our various businesses throughout the quarter. We characterized the expected disruption stemming from COVID-19 as manageable. But our teams and businesses exceeded our own expectations and worked diligently to successfully meet the needs of our customers. 
We have seen stability and return to growth in both our full line and specialty distribution channels as our business saw a return to growth over the course of the quarter. Our distribution businesses saw sales increase from May to June based on the average weekly sales in each month. These positive trends as we exited June set us up well for the fourth quarter. For example, our specialty physician business has proven resilient as practices adaptive to operating in the current environment, allowing them to meet the needs of their patients. 
Even our non-oncology physician business saw a steady return to pre-COVID levels across therapeutic areas. 
Additionally, we have seen increased demand from our health systems customer base as hospitals and clinics have adjusted their operations to provide care in the current environment. 
In our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, World Courier has continued to prove its value during a time of increased complexity with June being a record month for the business as volume and weights were up globally. 
Turning now to our updated financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2020. Revenue is now expected to be in the mid single-digit percent growth range as the June quarter proved to be resilient as doctor patient interactions returned and patients focused on adherence and well-being, allowing for continued care and pharmaceutical utilization. 
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the mid- to high single-digit percent as a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the same range and to reflect our improved expectation for the other segment's operating income to grow in the low single digits instead of a decline for the fiscal year. 
As a reminder, due to exiting the PharmeDium business, the pharmaceutical distribution segment has a tailwind of $35 million for the fiscal year and $18 million of that tailwind is in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding tax rate. Entering the last quarter of the year, we are narrowing our tax rate guidance from a range of 21% to 22% to guidance of approximately 21%. 
Lastly, we are slightly lowering our expectation for CapEx to approximately $375 million, down from $400 million. 
As it pertains to fiscal 2021, our corporate planning process remains unchanged, we will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process. 
In closing, I continue to take great pride in being part of Amerisourcebergen, and I'm inspired by the commitment, sincerity and focus on execution that are embedded in Amerisourcebergen's culture. The resiliency of our business and the determination of our associates to leverage Amerisourcebergen, knowledge and reach makes us even more confident today that we will emerge from this unprecedented time with enhanced capabilities and innovative solutions for the health care system. Our company is strong and well positioned, and we are committed to making it even better for all our associates, which will enable and accelerate long-term value for all stakeholders.

In terms of cost efficiency, really, in this environment during the June quarter, we were really focused on not skimping on costs. We had some extra compensation that we invested in our front-line associates who really work heroic in their efforts in our distribution centers, and that's worked out very well. We've had additional cleaning costs and those sorts of costs in our distribution centers. So we've had some additional costs but really, we've also had natural savings in other areas such as travel expenses were well down during the quarter. So those things, the large extent, offset each other. And you can see we did quite well during the quarter and from an operating expense standpoint. Some of the things you said that what are we doing from a customer standpoint, you mentioned -- Steve commented on MWI during his script, there are really a number of value-added services that MWI has been rolling out the customers to help in this environment, whether it be telehealth or digital payment plans that Steve talked to or social distancing tools like parking lot drop off. So these are value-added tools that MWI is providing to customers. Kind of same type of thing. We've just seen businesses like World Courier be able to provide even more services and managing complexity in this type of environment. And as air transport capacity was limited customers put more value on the types of services that world career can provide. So those are just a couple of samples of additional customer services we were providing."

But we've also done a lot of things like -- again, I talked about Ion earlier. Ion has been able to transfer their meeting environment to online. And a lot of companies have done that, but it's still been very important we have that strong sense of continuity with our customers. I think we've been able to manage in this digital environment with both large and small customers. And that's been very important.

And so -- but I think I caught most of the question. 
So heading into 2021, we're in the midst of our internal pending process like we always are at this type of year. Some of the things that we're looking at if we're doing our '21 planning, our COVID impacts and what could be the COVID impacts on the health care system. We're looking, of course, at all of our business unit expectations. We're looking at OpEx. We did have some benefits to OpEx in the most recent quarter, which might be hard to get that level of OpEx benefit in FY '21, particularly as we look at things like re-entry costs, in fiscal year '21. Of course, we're looking at brand and generic pricing, and we've talked about some of the duration of generic deflation that we've seen this year and what happens there in fiscal year '21. So we're really focused on expanding our value proposition, deepening our relationships and growing operating income as we look at fiscal year '21. 
And then also, one thing that is important to note is as you look at fiscal year '21 growth when we do come out with guidance compared to fiscal year '20, as we did have a meaningful PharmeDium benefit in fiscal year '20. It was -- as I said in the prepared remarks about $9 million in the June quarter, about $18 million expected in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the fiscal year.

So specialty is -- look, we had -- if you look at oncology, obviously, our biggest business, we were off a couple of percent in April and then recovered very well, and we're back to the levels -- we were back to pre-COVID levels basically in oncology. Some of the other businesses, it was a little bit different. Some of the base businesses they were a bit weaker, but we're now seeing them really lift up. And I'd say that just going into July, the trends have stabilized. So there was a pent-up demand. So we saw some really strong numbers and it's not like that. It does not like we saw you where it's going to keep on going up high. 
So it's back to pre-COVID levels and I think that -- again, if you have MS, if you have muscular degeneration, obviously, if you have a chemotherapy treatments, those are incredibly important. And as soon as you feel at all safe, you're going to return. 
One thing that's very interesting is that the distribution of services into the community for specialty is unique in this country, and it's proven, I think, very durable for the patients. And that's what we've always trying to make the point that it's very important that patients can access care where they need to. And I think in this crisis, a lot of patients fell a lot safer going to the physician's office, then they went into a health system or even a larger outpatient system.

And so we are pleased by the trends that we're seeing. But of course, as Steve said, what we saw in July was more of a stabilization. 
And then World Courier, as I indicated during the prepared remarks, World Courier had a record month in the month of June, just very strong results. Customers really placing value on growth couriers service. World Courier, as I've said before, we've said before, really excels at managing complexity and as air transport capacity was limited. Customers value the service. There were some COVID-related opportunities like direct to patients. And so -- and overall, just in a positive trends at World Courier that like our other businesses, I mean, we saw good growth in June, and it's continued in July."

You should know, of course, that we have been involved in active discussions with manufacturers as we start to plan.

So also, the manufacturers do, do some of that direct. But flu vaccine is not material to ABC. It's not a very expensive product. It is somewhat difficult to manage. I was responsible -- I have responsibility from managing it for years because it was in our ASD division, which reported into me. We would literally start working on it as the season ended, we start working on bookings and the issues with the manufacturing, the strains, but it's not material to ABC, about 40% to 45% of the country as you know, gets the vaccine, and we expect that it would be higher this year, and we hope it will be higher this year or so.

At that time. 10 years ago, most Latin people weren't as us were they interested in 90-day scripts. But it's certainly something that has become more common in the market, as you know. 
And again, we would point to the unique role that the community pharmacists have today as one of the most trusted and accessible health care professionals. And literally with very good value.

AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the resilience of our business and our associates who worked diligently to ensure continued patient access. Our teams are leveraging AmerisourceBergen's scale, expertise and culture to deliver collaborative and innovative services and solutions to our partners as they navigate the complexities of the current environment.  
My remarks this morning will center on 2 key topics: first, I will highlight how AmerisourceBergen continues to protect and support our associates. Specifically, how we remain focused on advancing our talent and culture through development, career growth and diversity initiatives and why this is a clear competitive advantage; second, I'll discuss how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long term. For our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities we serve.  
As we shared last quarter, the health, safety and well-being of our associates continues to be our top priority. We have taken a number of steps to support our associates, particularly those on the front line, guided by our purpose and value at every turn. We have prioritized the safety of our associates. We have continued to work diligently to facilitate patient access, supporting our manufacturer and provider customer as well as navigating these challenging times. I remain incredibly proud of the work our associates are undertaking across all areas of our business.  
As I discussed on our earnings call last November, our talent is one of AmerisourceBergen's biggest competitive advantages. Our associates power our culture and are driven by our purpose. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, and this is demonstrated across the entire organization. We know the experience of our associates is enhanced when they believe in the values and purposes of their employer. And as a company, we have prioritized this by focusing on talent development, career growth and diversity initiatives. 
In May, AmerisourceBergen was named a DiversityInc noteworthy company for the fourth consecutive year due to our hiring, retention and promotion of women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people and veterans. While I'm proud that AmerisourceBergen has been direct -- recognized for our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are committed to fostering an even more diverse and inclusive workforce. We are dedicated to growing, learning and shaping our approach to diversity and inclusion for the betterment of our workforce and the communities we serve. With this in mind, we took time over the past several weeks to discuss social injustice and racial inequity and fostered a candid dialogue to discuss topics, including racism and unconscious bias.
We facilitated all associate town halls with black leaders and other leaders of color volunteered to share their insights and personal experiences in dealing with discrimination and systemic racism. These discussions, though somewhat difficult, are a necessary step to foster true change.  
We recognize this is an ongoing effort, and we are committed to continuous improvement. There is significant intrinsic value created for all our stakeholders by having a strong culture and diversity that mirrors society as a whole. I look forward to sharing more about the progress we are making in this important area in the quarters to come.  
Now turning to our results. The June quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our business as we successfully managed through the new challenges across the global health care system. The supply chain has become the invisible pillar of medical innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AmerisourceBergen and our industry as a whole have become understood for what we truly are. A strategic asset as awareness has been heightened around the importance of pharmaceutical security, channel data and sustainability of supply. AmerisourceBergen is taking this opportunity to deepen our relationship with our partners and expand on our value proposition as we continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. The 4 key differentiators that serve as pillars of our company continue to position us for continued value creation.  
First, our broad and strategic relationships provides stability and partnerships with key customers in each segment of the health care system. Members of our good neighbor pharmacy network demonstrated the essential roles they play within their communities during this difficult times. Thousands of independent pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and staff members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need, even when things are at their most chaotic. They have all adapted at lightning speed to combat the pandemic and serve their communities in new and inventive ways, whether through delivering care packages to the immunocompromised or offering a meal to those who lost their jobs during this crisis.  
Independent pharmacies have supported patients while maintaining the highest level of customer service. We are proud to partner with these frontline health care providers to deliver care to those who need it most.  
Second, we continue to build on our leadership position in specialty distribution and services. Our industry-leading specialty distribution businesses have AmerisourceBergen positioned to leverage our relationships and expertise in a key part of the market. We continue to see increased biosimilar utilization, particularly in oncology, where our ION business differentiate our value proposition for both our provider customers and manufacturer partners. The growth we are seeing in biosimilars uptake is encouraging for the future, not only for AmerisourceBergen, but for patient access and the U.S. health care system overall.  
On the distribution side, we have been working closely with our provider customers as they take the necessary actions to improve operability.  
Community-based practices have adapted to continue treating patients through telehealth visits and by implementing new safety protocols to treat the most critical cases in the office.  
In order to minimize patient care disruption, health care providers have implemented new distancing protocols, enhanced office cleaning procedures and acquired additional PPE for staff. The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer in the past few months, have further illustrated the vital role of specialty practices in the treatment of critically ill patients in controlled environments. Patients are keenly aware of specialty physician practices' ability to provide safe, effective and convenient treatment at a time when health and well-being have never been so important.  
I mentioned last quarter that the initial restrictive measures negatively impacted necessary patient access to things such as screenings and testing. As the country continues to navigate the complexities of this pandemic, it is vital that care is not deferred. Providers are more equipped to operate in the current environment to the benefit of the health and well-being of all patients.  
Third, AmerisourceBergen associates continue to focus on providing innovative services and solutions for our partners in the health care system to navigate these challenging times. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help our customers in the current environment and is focused on providing them with important resources.  
For example, our sourcing and distribution teams are leveraging our commercial expertise and data and analytics capabilities to provide manufacturing and government entities with actionable channel insights. We are able to provide significant transparency into the pharmaceutical supply chain and related end markets, which is an important resource as stakeholders seek to be fully informed by data as they face new challenges.  
AmerisourceBergen is focused on being solutions-oriented and continuing to identify ways to add value, particularly at this time of heightened focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain.  
And at our MWI Animal Health business, we announced 2 new offerings designed to help veterinarians manage the financial impact of COVID-19. The offerings allow practices to provide flexible financing solutions for clients who may be struggling to afford quality care for their pets or we may just find more certainty in an uncertain economic landscape. The offering ease the financial burden of both routine and emergency pet care, while also helping practices achieve more consistent revenue, long-term client engagement and most importantly, better outcomes for their patients.  
Finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. We continue to focus on strong corporate stewardship in order to create value for all our stakeholders.  
In addition to some of the initiatives I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation brought together more than 60 nonprofit partners and peers during a virtual conference to facilitate collaboration, share best practices and learn from one another. The event focused on developing strategies to address some of the most difficult issues affecting society today, including pandemic resilience, social justice and racial equality, health and community improvement. 
AmerisourceBergen is committed to strong corporate citizenship and continuous improvement. We are driven by our talent and culture, differentiated by our robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services and United in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our values, strategic partnerships and market leadership position AmerisourceBergen to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our third quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. As we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, I can say without hesitation that I have been profoundly impressed by the execution and dedication across AmerisourceBergen as our businesses have proven resilient as we continue our essential work of enabling patient access.  
I am even more proud of the engagement and commitment by our associates and leaders as we come together to address systematic racism and commit to progressing towards equality and justice in everything we do. The actions we are taking to improve diversity, equity and inclusion will make AmerisourceBergen an even better company.  
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning: first, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance; second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance.  
Moving now to our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85, an increase of 5%, primarily due to solid operating income slightly above prior year, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and operating income were each up only slightly as the timing of COVID-related impacts dampened our growth rates in the June quarter.  
Rather than spending time discussing these small year-over-year increases at the consolidated level, I will instead focus on the segment-level items and provide incremental color in the guidance section. 
Net interest expense increased $2 million to $38 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income, resulting principally from a decline in investment interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, we expect our fourth quarter net interest expense to be in line with the third quarter.  
Moving now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 18.8%, down from 21% in the prior year quarter due to a benefit resulting from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count declined 3% to 205.5 million shares, primarily due to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, year-to-date, our adjusted free cash flow was $715 million. Our cash flow guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged as we expect the fourth quarter will generate meaningful cash flow.  
We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash, of which $490 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results.  
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $43.6 billion up only slightly due to the increased March quarter customer purchases associated with the onset of COVID-19, which resulted in fewer purchases in the June quarter. Segment operating income increased about 3.6% to $427 million with our operating income margin up 3 basis points as we benefited from lower administrative expenses and higher gross profit. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had a $9 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharMEDium business.  
While the timing and complexity of the impact of COVID-19 somewhat distorts the comparability of our numbers this quarter, it is abundantly clear that our pharmaceutical-centered strategy, deep relationships, talented associates and leading businesses have enabled AmerisourceBergen's resilience.  
The teams and associates across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses have done commendable work to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, ensuring safe and secure patient access to pharmaceuticals and supporting the evolving needs of our manufacturer and provider partners.  
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI.  
In the quarter, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4% primarily due to growth at our Consulting group and World Courier. Operating income for the group declined by $12 million or 13% primarily due to impacts from COVID-19 at our MWI business. In May, we called out expected volume pressure for our MWI business associated with COVID-19-related impacts.  
During the June quarter, we saw MWI's companion animals business rebound very well as vet visits normalized. However, MWI's production animal business stepped down meaningfully in April and again in May and then leveled off. The production animal business continued to see pressure stemming from a decline in food service demand.  
This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range from $7.35 to $7.65 to our new guidance range of $7.80 to $7.95 as AmerisourceBergen's business has proven even more resilient than we had incorporated into our previous range.  
When we provided our guidance back in May, we anticipated that June quarter EPS would decline due to the March pull forward of pharmaceutical sales and negative COVID-19-related impacts on our various businesses throughout the quarter. We characterized the expected disruption stemming from COVID-19 as manageable. But our teams and businesses exceeded our own expectations and worked diligently to successfully meet the needs of our customers.  
We have seen stability and return to growth in both our full line and specialty distribution channels as our business saw a return to growth over the course of the quarter. Our distribution businesses saw sales increase from May to June based on the average weekly sales in each month. These positive trends as we exited June set us up well for the fourth quarter. For example, our specialty physician business has proven resilient as practices adaptive to operating in the current environment, allowing them to meet the needs of their patients.  
Even our non-oncology physician business saw a steady return to pre-COVID levels across therapeutic areas.  
Additionally, we have seen increased demand from our health systems customer base as hospitals and clinics have adjusted their operations to provide care in the current environment.  
In our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, World Courier has continued to prove its value during a time of increased complexity with June being a record month for the business as volume and weights were up globally.  
Turning now to our updated financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2020. Revenue is now expected to be in the mid single-digit percent growth range as the June quarter proved to be resilient as doctor-patient interactions returned and patients focused on adherence and well-being, allowing for continued care and pharmaceutical utilization.  
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the mid- to high single-digit percent range as a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the same range and to reflect our improved expectation for the other segment's operating income to grow in the low single digits instead of a decline for the fiscal year.  
As a reminder, due to exiting the PharMEDium business, the pharmaceutical distribution segment has a tailwind of $35 million for the fiscal year and $18 million of that tailwind is in the fourth quarter.  
Regarding tax rate. Entering the last quarter of the year, we are narrowing our tax rate guidance from a range of 21% to 22% to guidance of approximately 21%.  
Lastly, we are slightly lowering our expectation for CapEx to approximately $375 million, down from $400 million.  
As it pertains to fiscal 2021, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.  
In closing, I continue to take great pride in being part of AmerisourceBergen, and I'm inspired by the commitment, sincerity and focus on execution that are embedded in AmerisourceBergen's culture. The resiliency of our business and the determination of our associates to leverage AmerisourceBergen's knowledge and reach makes us even more confident today that we will emerge from this unprecedented time with enhanced capabilities and innovative solutions for the health care system. Our company is strong and well positioned, and we are committed to making it even better for all our associates, which will enable and accelerate long-term value for all stakeholders.

In terms of cost efficiency, really, in this environment during the June quarter, we were really focused on not skimping on costs. We had some extra compensation that we invested in our front-line associates who really were heroic in their efforts in our distribution centers, and that's worked out very well. We've had additional cleaning costs and those sorts of costs in our distribution centers. So we've had some additional costs but really, we've also had natural savings in other areas such as travel. Travel expenses were well down during the quarter. 
So those things, the large extent, offset each other. And you can see we did quite well during the quarter from -- and from an operating expense standpoint. Some of the things you said that what are we doing from a customer standpoint? You mentioned that Steve commented on MWI during his script. There are really a number of value-added services that MWI has been rolling out the customers to help in this environment, whether it be telehealth or digital payment plans that Steve talked to or social distancing tools like parking lot drop off. So these are value-added tools that MWI is providing to customers. Kind of the same type of thing. 
We've just seen businesses like World Courier be able to provide even more services and managing complexity in this type of environment. And as air transport capacity was limited, customers put more value on the types of services that World Courier can provide. So those are just a couple of the -- a couple of samples of additional customer services we were providing."

So heading into 2021, we're in the midst of our internal planning process like we always are at this time of the year. Some of the things that we're looking at as we're doing our '21 planning, our COVID impacts and what could be the COVID impacts on the health care system. We're -- again, we're looking, of course, at all of our business units' expectations. We're looking at OpEx. We did have some benefits to OpEx in the most recent quarter, which might be hard to get that level of OpEx benefit in fiscal year '21, particularly as we look at things like reentry costs in fiscal year '21. 
Of course, we're looking at brand and generic pricing, and we've talked about some of the moderation of generic deflation that we've seen this year and what happens there in fiscal year '21. So we're really focused on expanding our value proposition, deepening our relationships and growing operating income as we look at fiscal year '21.  
And then also, one thing that is important to note is, as you look at fiscal year '21 growth, when we do come out with guidance compared to fiscal year '20, as we did have a meaningful PharMEDium benefit in fiscal year '20. It was, as I said in the prepared remarks, about $9 million in the June quarter, about $18 million expected in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the fiscal year.

In some of the other businesses, it was a little bit different. Some of the Besse-based businesses they were a bit weaker, but we're now seeing them really lift up. And I'd say that just going into July, this -- the trends have stabilized. So there was a pent-up demand. So we saw some really strong numbers and it's not like that. It's not like we saw you where it's going to keep on going up high.  
So it's back to pre-COVID levels and I think that -- again, if you have MS, if you have muscular degeneration, obviously, if you have a chemotherapy treatments, those are incredibly important. And as soon as you feel at all safe, you're going to return.  
One thing that's very interesting is that the distribution of services into the community for specialty is unique in this country, and it's proven, I think, very durable for the patients. And that's what we've always, I'm trying to make the point that it's very important that patients can access care where they need to. And I think in this crisis, a lot of patients felt a lot safer going to the physician's office than they went into a health system or even a larger outpatient system. So it's a good example of the resiliency of the U.S. health care system, the way that we have such strong community practices. So, thank you."

There's also a lot of environmental issues. There's the cost issue, which I think everyone has always taken very seriously. The global supply chain has become incredibly complex.

So also, the manufacturers do, do some of that direct. But the flu vaccine, it is not material to ABC. It's not a very expensive product. It is somewhat difficult to manage. I was responsible -- I have responsibility from managing it for years because it was in our ASD division, which reported into me. And we would literally start working on it as that -- as the season ended. We started working on bookings and the issues with the manufacturing, the strains, but it's not material to ABC.

Of course, in March, we saw our mail uptick quite significantly, and it is well documented that there was an increase in the 90-day scripts. 
However, the counterargument to that is there is an increase in patient adherence, which is very good for business. And certainly, one of the things when -- I remember when I first became CEO and I talked to our Good Neighbor Pharmacy group, I said, ""You guys have to do 90-day scripts."" And at that time. 10 years ago, I must say then people would -- pharmacists weren't as interested in the 90-day scripts. But it's certainly something that has become more common in the market, as you know.  
And again, we would point to the unique role that the community pharmacists have today as one of the most trusted and accessible health care professionals and literally with very good value. I mean, you can go and pick up your generic prescription and pay a $5 co-pay in most cases and get access to a professional at your independent pharmacy.

Seniors are on Medicaid often, and they have supplemental insurance, and they are sometimes not employed or they have their retirement set. And we don't -- as you well know, we don't really differentiate between a Medicaid, but we're selling in aggregate. So it doesn't really matter to us what coverage it is, but I would agree with you that it's very important that patients continue to access coverage.

AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the resilience of our business and our associates who worked diligently to ensure continued patient access.",1504,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the resilience of our business and our associates who worked diligently to ensure continued patient access. Our teams are leveraging AmerisourceBergen's scale, expertise and culture to deliver collaborative and innovative services and solutions to our partners as they navigate the complexities of the current environment.  
My remarks this morning will center on 2 key topics: first, I will highlight how AmerisourceBergen continues to protect and support our associates. Specifically, how we remain focused on advancing our talent and culture through development, career growth and diversity initiatives and why this is a clear competitive advantage; second, I'll discuss how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long term. For our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities we serve.  
As we shared last quarter, the health, safety and well-being of our associates continues to be our top priority. We have taken a number of steps to support our associates, particularly those on the front line, guided by our purpose and value at every turn. We have prioritized the safety of our associates. We have continued to work diligently to facilitate patient access, supporting our manufacturer and provider customer as well as navigating these challenging times. I remain incredibly proud of the work our associates are undertaking across all areas of our business.  
As I discussed on our earnings call last November, our talent is one of AmerisourceBergen's biggest competitive advantages. Our associates power our culture and are driven by our purpose. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, and this is demonstrated across the entire organization. We know the experience of our associates is enhanced when they believe in the values and purposes of their employer. And as a company, we have prioritized this by focusing on talent development, career growth and diversity initiatives. 
In May, AmerisourceBergen was named a DiversityInc noteworthy company for the fourth consecutive year due to our hiring, retention and promotion of women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people and veterans. While I'm proud that AmerisourceBergen has been direct -- recognized for our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are committed to fostering an even more diverse and inclusive workforce. We are dedicated to growing, learning and shaping our approach to diversity and inclusion for the betterment of our workforce and the communities we serve. With this in mind, we took time over the past several weeks to discuss social injustice and racial inequity and fostered a candid dialogue to discuss topics, including racism and unconscious bias.
We facilitated all associate town halls with black leaders and other leaders of color volunteered to share their insights and personal experiences in dealing with discrimination and systemic racism. These discussions, though somewhat difficult, are a necessary step to foster true change.  
We recognize this is an ongoing effort, and we are committed to continuous improvement. There is significant intrinsic value created for all our stakeholders by having a strong culture and diversity that mirrors society as a whole. I look forward to sharing more about the progress we are making in this important area in the quarters to come.  
Now turning to our results. The June quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our business as we successfully managed through the new challenges across the global health care system. The supply chain has become the invisible pillar of medical innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AmerisourceBergen and our industry as a whole have become understood for what we truly are. A strategic asset as awareness has been heightened around the importance of pharmaceutical security, channel data and sustainability of supply. AmerisourceBergen is taking this opportunity to deepen our relationship with our partners and expand on our value proposition as we continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. The 4 key differentiators that serve as pillars of our company continue to position us for continued value creation.  
First, our broad and strategic relationships provides stability and partnerships with key customers in each segment of the health care system. Members of our good neighbor pharmacy network demonstrated the essential roles they play within their communities during this difficult times. Thousands of independent pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and staff members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need, even when things are at their most chaotic. They have all adapted at lightning speed to combat the pandemic and serve their communities in new and inventive ways, whether through delivering care packages to the immunocompromised or offering a meal to those who lost their jobs during this crisis.  
Independent pharmacies have supported patients while maintaining the highest level of customer service. We are proud to partner with these frontline health care providers to deliver care to those who need it most.  
Second, we continue to build on our leadership position in specialty distribution and services. Our industry-leading specialty distribution businesses have AmerisourceBergen positioned to leverage our relationships and expertise in a key part of the market. We continue to see increased biosimilar utilization, particularly in oncology, where our ION business differentiate our value proposition for both our provider customers and manufacturer partners. The growth we are seeing in biosimilars uptake is encouraging for the future, not only for AmerisourceBergen, but for patient access and the U.S. health care system overall.  
On the distribution side, we have been working closely with our provider customers as they take the necessary actions to improve operability.  
Community-based practices have adapted to continue treating patients through telehealth visits and by implementing new safety protocols to treat the most critical cases in the office.  
In order to minimize patient care disruption, health care providers have implemented new distancing protocols, enhanced office cleaning procedures and acquired additional PPE for staff. The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer in the past few months, have further illustrated the vital role of specialty practices in the treatment of critically ill patients in controlled environments. Patients are keenly aware of specialty physician practices' ability to provide safe, effective and convenient treatment at a time when health and well-being have never been so important.  
I mentioned last quarter that the initial restrictive measures negatively impacted necessary patient access to things such as screenings and testing. As the country continues to navigate the complexities of this pandemic, it is vital that care is not deferred. Providers are more equipped to operate in the current environment to the benefit of the health and well-being of all patients.  
Third, AmerisourceBergen associates continue to focus on providing innovative services and solutions for our partners in the health care system to navigate these challenging times. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help our customers in the current environment and is focused on providing them with important resources.  
For example, our sourcing and distribution teams are leveraging our commercial expertise and data and analytics capabilities to provide manufacturing and government entities with actionable channel insights. We are able to provide significant transparency into the pharmaceutical supply chain and related end markets, which is an important resource as stakeholders seek to be fully informed by data as they face new challenges.  
AmerisourceBergen is focused on being solutions-oriented and continuing to identify ways to add value, particularly at this time of heightened focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain.  
And at our MWI Animal Health business, we announced 2 new offerings designed to help veterinarians manage the financial impact of COVID-19. The offerings allow practices to provide flexible financing solutions for clients who may be struggling to afford quality care for their pets or we may just find more certainty in an uncertain economic landscape. The offering ease the financial burden of both routine and emergency pet care, while also helping practices achieve more consistent revenue, long-term client engagement and most importantly, better outcomes for their patients.  
Finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. We continue to focus on strong corporate stewardship in order to create value for all our stakeholders.  
In addition to some of the initiatives I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation brought together more than 60 nonprofit partners and peers during a virtual conference to facilitate collaboration, share best practices and learn from one another. The event focused on developing strategies to address some of the most difficult issues affecting society today, including pandemic resilience, social justice and racial equality, health and community improvement. 
AmerisourceBergen is committed to strong corporate citizenship and continuous improvement. We are driven by our talent and culture, differentiated by our robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services and United in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our values, strategic partnerships and market leadership position AmerisourceBergen to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our third quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. As we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, I can say without hesitation that I have been profoundly impressed by the execution and dedication across AmerisourceBergen as our businesses have proven resilient as we continue our essential work of enabling patient access.  
I am even more proud of the engagement and commitment by our associates and leaders as we come together to address systematic racism and commit to progressing towards equality and justice in everything we do. The actions we are taking to improve diversity, equity and inclusion will make AmerisourceBergen an even better company.  
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning: first, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance; second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance.  
Moving now to our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85, an increase of 5%, primarily due to solid operating income slightly above prior year, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and operating income were each up only slightly as the timing of COVID-related impacts dampened our growth rates in the June quarter.  
Rather than spending time discussing these small year-over-year increases at the consolidated level, I will instead focus on the segment-level items and provide incremental color in the guidance section. 
Net interest expense increased $2 million to $38 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income, resulting principally from a decline in investment interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, we expect our fourth quarter net interest expense to be in line with the third quarter.  
Moving now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 18.8%, down from 21% in the prior year quarter due to a benefit resulting from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count declined 3% to 205.5 million shares, primarily due to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, year-to-date, our adjusted free cash flow was $715 million. Our cash flow guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged as we expect the fourth quarter will generate meaningful cash flow.  
We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash, of which $490 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results.  
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $43.6 billion up only slightly due to the increased March quarter customer purchases associated with the onset of COVID-19, which resulted in fewer purchases in the June quarter. Segment operating income increased about 3.6% to $427 million with our operating income margin up 3 basis points as we benefited from lower administrative expenses and higher gross profit. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had a $9 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharMEDium business.  
While the timing and complexity of the impact of COVID-19 somewhat distorts the comparability of our numbers this quarter, it is abundantly clear that our pharmaceutical-centered strategy, deep relationships, talented associates and leading businesses have enabled AmerisourceBergen's resilience.  
The teams and associates across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses have done commendable work to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, ensuring safe and secure patient access to pharmaceuticals and supporting the evolving needs of our manufacturer and provider partners.  
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI.  
In the quarter, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4% primarily due to growth at our Consulting group and World Courier. Operating income for the group declined by $12 million or 13% primarily due to impacts from COVID-19 at our MWI business. In May, we called out expected volume pressure for our MWI business associated with COVID-19-related impacts.  
During the June quarter, we saw MWI's companion animals business rebound very well as vet visits normalized. However, MWI's production animal business stepped down meaningfully in April and again in May and then leveled off. The production animal business continued to see pressure stemming from a decline in food service demand.  
This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range from $7.35 to $7.65 to our new guidance range of $7.80 to $7.95 as AmerisourceBergen's business has proven even more resilient than we had incorporated into our previous range.  
When we provided our guidance back in May, we anticipated that June quarter EPS would decline due to the March pull forward of pharmaceutical sales and negative COVID-19-related impacts on our various businesses throughout the quarter. We characterized the expected disruption stemming from COVID-19 as manageable. But our teams and businesses exceeded our own expectations and worked diligently to successfully meet the needs of our customers.  
We have seen stability and return to growth in both our full line and specialty distribution channels as our business saw a return to growth over the course of the quarter. Our distribution businesses saw sales increase from May to June based on the average weekly sales in each month. These positive trends as we exited June set us up well for the fourth quarter. For example, our specialty physician business has proven resilient as practices adaptive to operating in the current environment, allowing them to meet the needs of their patients.  
Even our non-oncology physician business saw a steady return to pre-COVID levels across therapeutic areas.  
Additionally, we have seen increased demand from our health systems customer base as hospitals and clinics have adjusted their operations to provide care in the current environment.  
In our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, World Courier has continued to prove its value during a time of increased complexity with June being a record month for the business as volume and weights were up globally.  
Turning now to our updated financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2020. Revenue is now expected to be in the mid single-digit percent growth range as the June quarter proved to be resilient as doctor-patient interactions returned and patients focused on adherence and well-being, allowing for continued care and pharmaceutical utilization.  
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the mid- to high single-digit percent range as a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the same range and to reflect our improved expectation for the other segment's operating income to grow in the low single digits instead of a decline for the fiscal year.  
As a reminder, due to exiting the PharMEDium business, the pharmaceutical distribution segment has a tailwind of $35 million for the fiscal year and $18 million of that tailwind is in the fourth quarter.  
Regarding tax rate. Entering the last quarter of the year, we are narrowing our tax rate guidance from a range of 21% to 22% to guidance of approximately 21%.  
Lastly, we are slightly lowering our expectation for CapEx to approximately $375 million, down from $400 million.  
As it pertains to fiscal 2021, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.  
In closing, I continue to take great pride in being part of AmerisourceBergen, and I'm inspired by the commitment, sincerity and focus on execution that are embedded in AmerisourceBergen's culture. The resiliency of our business and the determination of our associates to leverage AmerisourceBergen's knowledge and reach makes us even more confident today that we will emerge from this unprecedented time with enhanced capabilities and innovative solutions for the health care system. Our company is strong and well positioned, and we are committed to making it even better for all our associates, which will enable and accelerate long-term value for all stakeholders.

In terms of cost efficiency, really, in this environment during the June quarter, we were really focused on not skimping on costs. We had some extra compensation that we invested in our front-line associates who really were heroic in their efforts in our distribution centers, and that's worked out very well. We've had additional cleaning costs and those sorts of costs in our distribution centers. So we've had some additional costs but really, we've also had natural savings in other areas such as travel. Travel expenses were well down during the quarter. 
So those things, the large extent, offset each other. And you can see we did quite well during the quarter from -- and from an operating expense standpoint. Some of the things you said that what are we doing from a customer standpoint? You mentioned that Steve commented on MWI during his script. There are really a number of value-added services that MWI has been rolling out the customers to help in this environment, whether it be telehealth or digital payment plans that Steve talked to or social distancing tools like parking lot drop off. So these are value-added tools that MWI is providing to customers. Kind of the same type of thing. 
We've just seen businesses like World Courier be able to provide even more services and managing complexity in this type of environment. And as air transport capacity was limited, customers put more value on the types of services that World Courier can provide. So those are just a couple of the -- a couple of samples of additional customer services we were providing."

So heading into 2021, we're in the midst of our internal planning process like we always are at this time of the year. Some of the things that we're looking at as we're doing our '21 planning, our COVID impacts and what could be the COVID impacts on the health care system. We're -- again, we're looking, of course, at all of our business units' expectations. We're looking at OpEx. We did have some benefits to OpEx in the most recent quarter, which might be hard to get that level of OpEx benefit in fiscal year '21, particularly as we look at things like reentry costs in fiscal year '21. 
Of course, we're looking at brand and generic pricing, and we've talked about some of the moderation of generic deflation that we've seen this year and what happens there in fiscal year '21. So we're really focused on expanding our value proposition, deepening our relationships and growing operating income as we look at fiscal year '21.  
And then also, one thing that is important to note is, as you look at fiscal year '21 growth, when we do come out with guidance compared to fiscal year '20, as we did have a meaningful PharMEDium benefit in fiscal year '20. It was, as I said in the prepared remarks, about $9 million in the June quarter, about $18 million expected in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the fiscal year.

In some of the other businesses, it was a little bit different. Some of the Besse-based businesses they were a bit weaker, but we're now seeing them really lift up. And I'd say that just going into July, this -- the trends have stabilized. So there was a pent-up demand. So we saw some really strong numbers and it's not like that. It's not like we saw you where it's going to keep on going up high.  
So it's back to pre-COVID levels and I think that -- again, if you have MS, if you have muscular degeneration, obviously, if you have a chemotherapy treatments, those are incredibly important. And as soon as you feel at all safe, you're going to return.  
One thing that's very interesting is that the distribution of services into the community for specialty is unique in this country, and it's proven, I think, very durable for the patients. And that's what we've always, I'm trying to make the point that it's very important that patients can access care where they need to. And I think in this crisis, a lot of patients felt a lot safer going to the physician's office than they went into a health system or even a larger outpatient system. So it's a good example of the resiliency of the U.S. health care system, the way that we have such strong community practices. So, thank you."

And then secondly, I think there's also been a lot of talk recently about on -- because of the crisis, in part, but onshoring production of either generic drugs or API for those drugs. Can you give us your thoughts on what that would mean either more broadly for the generics market and more specifically, what it might do on the distribution side of things?"

So of course, these things don't happen overnight. 
There's also a lot of environmental issues. There's the cost issue, which I think everyone has always taken very seriously. The global supply chain has become incredibly complex. And of course, AmerisourceBergen will work with policymakers, offer our services as we have, offer our expertise and also work with the industry. So to see if there are any major changes. And if there are, then it would have to be done through a statute. So it would have to be done through the legislative process. So we would be involved in that. So, thank you."

You should know, of course, that we have been involved in active discussions with manufacturers as we start to plan.

So also, the manufacturers do, do some of that direct. But the flu vaccine, it is not material to ABC. It's not a very expensive product. It is somewhat difficult to manage. I was responsible -- I have responsibility from managing it for years because it was in our ASD division, which reported into me. And we would literally start working on it as that -- as the season ended. We started working on bookings and the issues with the manufacturing, the strains, but it's not material to ABC.

Of course, in March, we saw our mail uptick quite significantly, and it is well documented that there was an increase in the 90-day scripts. 
However, the counterargument to that is there is an increase in patient adherence, which is very good for business. And certainly, one of the things when -- I remember when I first became CEO and I talked to our Good Neighbor Pharmacy group, I said, ""You guys have to do 90-day scripts."" And at that time. 10 years ago, I must say then people would -- pharmacists weren't as interested in the 90-day scripts. But it's certainly something that has become more common in the market, as you know.  
And again, we would point to the unique role that the community pharmacists have today as one of the most trusted and accessible health care professionals and literally with very good value. I mean, you can go and pick up your generic prescription and pay a $5 co-pay in most cases and get access to a professional at your independent pharmacy.

Seniors are on Medicaid often, and they have supplemental insurance, and they are sometimes not employed or they have their retirement set. And we don't -- as you well know, we don't really differentiate between a Medicaid, but we're selling in aggregate. So it doesn't really matter to us what coverage it is, but I would agree with you that it's very important that patients continue to access coverage.

AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the resilience of our business and our associates who worked diligently to ensure continued patient access.",1504,"Thank you, Bennett, and good morning to everyone on today's call. AmerisourceBergen delivered strong results in the third quarter of 2020 driven by the resilience of our business and our associates who worked diligently to ensure continued patient access. Our teams are leveraging AmerisourceBergen's scale, expertise and culture to deliver collaborative and innovative services and solutions to our partners as they navigate the complexities of the current environment.  
My remarks this morning will center on 2 key topics: first, I will highlight how AmerisourceBergen continues to protect and support our associates. Specifically, how we remain focused on advancing our talent and culture through development, career growth and diversity initiatives and why this is a clear competitive advantage; second, I'll discuss how AmerisourceBergen is positioned to deliver value over the long term. For our shareholders and also for our associates, customers, suppliers and the communities we serve.  
As we shared last quarter, the health, safety and well-being of our associates continues to be our top priority. We have taken a number of steps to support our associates, particularly those on the front line, guided by our purpose and value at every turn. We have prioritized the safety of our associates. We have continued to work diligently to facilitate patient access, supporting our manufacturer and provider customer as well as navigating these challenging times. I remain incredibly proud of the work our associates are undertaking across all areas of our business.  
As I discussed on our earnings call last November, our talent is one of AmerisourceBergen's biggest competitive advantages. Our associates power our culture and are driven by our purpose. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, and this is demonstrated across the entire organization. We know the experience of our associates is enhanced when they believe in the values and purposes of their employer. And as a company, we have prioritized this by focusing on talent development, career growth and diversity initiatives. 
In May, AmerisourceBergen was named a DiversityInc noteworthy company for the fourth consecutive year due to our hiring, retention and promotion of women, minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ people and veterans. While I'm proud that AmerisourceBergen has been direct -- recognized for our diversity and inclusion efforts, we are committed to fostering an even more diverse and inclusive workforce. We are dedicated to growing, learning and shaping our approach to diversity and inclusion for the betterment of our workforce and the communities we serve. With this in mind, we took time over the past several weeks to discuss social injustice and racial inequity and fostered a candid dialogue to discuss topics, including racism and unconscious bias.
We facilitated all associate town halls with black leaders and other leaders of color volunteered to share their insights and personal experiences in dealing with discrimination and systemic racism. These discussions, though somewhat difficult, are a necessary step to foster true change.  
We recognize this is an ongoing effort, and we are committed to continuous improvement. There is significant intrinsic value created for all our stakeholders by having a strong culture and diversity that mirrors society as a whole. I look forward to sharing more about the progress we are making in this important area in the quarters to come.  
Now turning to our results. The June quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our business as we successfully managed through the new challenges across the global health care system. The supply chain has become the invisible pillar of medical innovation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AmerisourceBergen and our industry as a whole have become understood for what we truly are. A strategic asset as awareness has been heightened around the importance of pharmaceutical security, channel data and sustainability of supply. AmerisourceBergen is taking this opportunity to deepen our relationship with our partners and expand on our value proposition as we continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. The 4 key differentiators that serve as pillars of our company continue to position us for continued value creation.  
First, our broad and strategic relationships provides stability and partnerships with key customers in each segment of the health care system. Members of our good neighbor pharmacy network demonstrated the essential roles they play within their communities during this difficult times. Thousands of independent pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and staff members have been working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure their patients continue getting the care they need, even when things are at their most chaotic. They have all adapted at lightning speed to combat the pandemic and serve their communities in new and inventive ways, whether through delivering care packages to the immunocompromised or offering a meal to those who lost their jobs during this crisis.  
Independent pharmacies have supported patients while maintaining the highest level of customer service. We are proud to partner with these frontline health care providers to deliver care to those who need it most.  
Second, we continue to build on our leadership position in specialty distribution and services. Our industry-leading specialty distribution businesses have AmerisourceBergen positioned to leverage our relationships and expertise in a key part of the market. We continue to see increased biosimilar utilization, particularly in oncology, where our ION business differentiate our value proposition for both our provider customers and manufacturer partners. The growth we are seeing in biosimilars uptake is encouraging for the future, not only for AmerisourceBergen, but for patient access and the U.S. health care system overall.  
On the distribution side, we have been working closely with our provider customers as they take the necessary actions to improve operability.  
Community-based practices have adapted to continue treating patients through telehealth visits and by implementing new safety protocols to treat the most critical cases in the office.  
In order to minimize patient care disruption, health care providers have implemented new distancing protocols, enhanced office cleaning procedures and acquired additional PPE for staff. The value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer in the past few months, have further illustrated the vital role of specialty practices in the treatment of critically ill patients in controlled environments. Patients are keenly aware of specialty physician practices' ability to provide safe, effective and convenient treatment at a time when health and well-being have never been so important.  
I mentioned last quarter that the initial restrictive measures negatively impacted necessary patient access to things such as screenings and testing. As the country continues to navigate the complexities of this pandemic, it is vital that care is not deferred. Providers are more equipped to operate in the current environment to the benefit of the health and well-being of all patients.  
Third, AmerisourceBergen associates continue to focus on providing innovative services and solutions for our partners in the health care system to navigate these challenging times. AmerisourceBergen is uniquely positioned to help our customers in the current environment and is focused on providing them with important resources.  
For example, our sourcing and distribution teams are leveraging our commercial expertise and data and analytics capabilities to provide manufacturing and government entities with actionable channel insights. We are able to provide significant transparency into the pharmaceutical supply chain and related end markets, which is an important resource as stakeholders seek to be fully informed by data as they face new challenges.  
AmerisourceBergen is focused on being solutions-oriented and continuing to identify ways to add value, particularly at this time of heightened focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain.  
And at our MWI Animal Health business, we announced 2 new offerings designed to help veterinarians manage the financial impact of COVID-19. The offerings allow practices to provide flexible financing solutions for clients who may be struggling to afford quality care for their pets or we may just find more certainty in an uncertain economic landscape. The offering ease the financial burden of both routine and emergency pet care, while also helping practices achieve more consistent revenue, long-term client engagement and most importantly, better outcomes for their patients.  
Finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. We continue to focus on strong corporate stewardship in order to create value for all our stakeholders.  
In addition to some of the initiatives I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, the AmerisourceBergen Foundation brought together more than 60 nonprofit partners and peers during a virtual conference to facilitate collaboration, share best practices and learn from one another. The event focused on developing strategies to address some of the most difficult issues affecting society today, including pandemic resilience, social justice and racial equality, health and community improvement. 
AmerisourceBergen is committed to strong corporate citizenship and continuous improvement. We are driven by our talent and culture, differentiated by our robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services and United in our responsibility to create healthier futures. Our values, strategic partnerships and market leadership position AmerisourceBergen to continue to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  
Thank you, again, for your interest in AmerisourceBergen.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our third quarter fiscal 2020 results. Jim?"

Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year June quarter. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release. As we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, I can say without hesitation that I have been profoundly impressed by the execution and dedication across AmerisourceBergen as our businesses have proven resilient as we continue our essential work of enabling patient access.  
I am even more proud of the engagement and commitment by our associates and leaders as we come together to address systematic racism and commit to progressing towards equality and justice in everything we do. The actions we are taking to improve diversity, equity and inclusion will make AmerisourceBergen an even better company.  
Turning now to discuss our third quarter results. I will provide commentary in 2 main areas this morning: first, I will detail our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance; second, I will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance.  
Moving now to our third quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.85, an increase of 5%, primarily due to solid operating income slightly above prior year, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count. Our consolidated revenue, gross profit, operating expenses and operating income were each up only slightly as the timing of COVID-related impacts dampened our growth rates in the June quarter.  
Rather than spending time discussing these small year-over-year increases at the consolidated level, I will instead focus on the segment-level items and provide incremental color in the guidance section. 
Net interest expense increased $2 million to $38 million, primarily due to a decrease in interest income, resulting principally from a decline in investment interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, we expect our fourth quarter net interest expense to be in line with the third quarter.  
Moving now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 18.8%, down from 21% in the prior year quarter due to a benefit resulting from a discrete tax item. Our diluted share count declined 3% to 205.5 million shares, primarily due to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises. Regarding free cash flow and cash balance, year-to-date, our adjusted free cash flow was $715 million. Our cash flow guidance for the fiscal year is unchanged as we expect the fourth quarter will generate meaningful cash flow.  
We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash, of which $490 million was held offshore and generally in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll cover our segment results.  
Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $43.6 billion up only slightly due to the increased March quarter customer purchases associated with the onset of COVID-19, which resulted in fewer purchases in the June quarter. Segment operating income increased about 3.6% to $427 million with our operating income margin up 3 basis points as we benefited from lower administrative expenses and higher gross profit. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had a $9 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharMEDium business.  
While the timing and complexity of the impact of COVID-19 somewhat distorts the comparability of our numbers this quarter, it is abundantly clear that our pharmaceutical-centered strategy, deep relationships, talented associates and leading businesses have enabled AmerisourceBergen's resilience.  
The teams and associates across our Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses have done commendable work to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, ensuring safe and secure patient access to pharmaceuticals and supporting the evolving needs of our manufacturer and provider partners.  
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI.  
In the quarter, total revenue was $1.8 billion, up 4% primarily due to growth at our Consulting group and World Courier. Operating income for the group declined by $12 million or 13% primarily due to impacts from COVID-19 at our MWI business. In May, we called out expected volume pressure for our MWI business associated with COVID-19-related impacts.  
During the June quarter, we saw MWI's companion animals business rebound very well as vet visits normalized. However, MWI's production animal business stepped down meaningfully in April and again in May and then leveled off. The production animal business continued to see pressure stemming from a decline in food service demand.  
This completes the review of our segment results, so I will now turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance. As we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range from $7.35 to $7.65 to our new guidance range of $7.80 to $7.95 as AmerisourceBergen's business has proven even more resilient than we had incorporated into our previous range.  
When we provided our guidance back in May, we anticipated that June quarter EPS would decline due to the March pull forward of pharmaceutical sales and negative COVID-19-related impacts on our various businesses throughout the quarter. We characterized the expected disruption stemming from COVID-19 as manageable. But our teams and businesses exceeded our own expectations and worked diligently to successfully meet the needs of our customers.  
We have seen stability and return to growth in both our full line and specialty distribution channels as our business saw a return to growth over the course of the quarter. Our distribution businesses saw sales increase from May to June based on the average weekly sales in each month. These positive trends as we exited June set us up well for the fourth quarter. For example, our specialty physician business has proven resilient as practices adaptive to operating in the current environment, allowing them to meet the needs of their patients.  
Even our non-oncology physician business saw a steady return to pre-COVID levels across therapeutic areas.  
Additionally, we have seen increased demand from our health systems customer base as hospitals and clinics have adjusted their operations to provide care in the current environment.  
In our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health businesses, World Courier has continued to prove its value during a time of increased complexity with June being a record month for the business as volume and weights were up globally.  
Turning now to our updated financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2020. Revenue is now expected to be in the mid single-digit percent growth range as the June quarter proved to be resilient as doctor-patient interactions returned and patients focused on adherence and well-being, allowing for continued care and pharmaceutical utilization.  
Turning now to operating income. We now expect to grow operating income in the mid- to high single-digit percent range as a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the same range and to reflect our improved expectation for the other segment's operating income to grow in the low single digits instead of a decline for the fiscal year.  
As a reminder, due to exiting the PharMEDium business, the pharmaceutical distribution segment has a tailwind of $35 million for the fiscal year and $18 million of that tailwind is in the fourth quarter.  
Regarding tax rate. Entering the last quarter of the year, we are narrowing our tax rate guidance from a range of 21% to 22% to guidance of approximately 21%.  
Lastly, we are slightly lowering our expectation for CapEx to approximately $375 million, down from $400 million.  
As it pertains to fiscal 2021, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. We will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of the current fiscal year. This approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process.  
In closing, I continue to take great pride in being part of AmerisourceBergen, and I'm inspired by the commitment, sincerity and focus on execution that are embedded in AmerisourceBergen's culture. The resiliency of our business and the determination of our associates to leverage AmerisourceBergen's knowledge and reach makes us even more confident today that we will emerge from this unprecedented time with enhanced capabilities and innovative solutions for the health care system. Our company is strong and well positioned, and we are committed to making it even better for all our associates, which will enable and accelerate long-term value for all stakeholders.

In terms of cost efficiency, really, in this environment during the June quarter, we were really focused on not skimping on costs. We had some extra compensation that we invested in our front-line associates who really were heroic in their efforts in our distribution centers, and that's worked out very well. We've had additional cleaning costs and those sorts of costs in our distribution centers. So we've had some additional costs but really, we've also had natural savings in other areas such as travel. Travel expenses were well down during the quarter. 
So those things, the large extent, offset each other. And you can see we did quite well during the quarter from -- and from an operating expense standpoint. Some of the things you said that what are we doing from a customer standpoint? You mentioned that Steve commented on MWI during his script. There are really a number of value-added services that MWI has been rolling out the customers to help in this environment, whether it be telehealth or digital payment plans that Steve talked to or social distancing tools like parking lot drop off. So these are value-added tools that MWI is providing to customers. Kind of the same type of thing. 
We've just seen businesses like World Courier be able to provide even more services and managing complexity in this type of environment. And as air transport capacity was limited, customers put more value on the types of services that World Courier can provide. So those are just a couple of the -- a couple of samples of additional customer services we were providing."

But we've also done a lot of things like -- again, I talked about ION earlier. ION has been able to transfer their meeting environment to online. And a lot of companies have done it, but it's still been very important then we have that strong sense of continuity with our customers.

And then I think there is a follow-up there on specialty which, of course, Steve will address it. I will say that you were breaking up there on the telecom. And so -- but I think I caught most of the question.  
So heading into 2021, we're in the midst of our internal planning process like we always are at this time of the year. Some of the things that we're looking at as we're doing our '21 planning, our COVID impacts and what could be the COVID impacts on the health care system. We're -- again, we're looking, of course, at all of our business units' expectations. We're looking at OpEx. We did have some benefits to OpEx in the most recent quarter, which might be hard to get that level of OpEx benefit in fiscal year '21, particularly as we look at things like reentry costs in fiscal year '21. 
Of course, we're looking at brand and generic pricing, and we've talked about some of the moderation of generic deflation that we've seen this year and what happens there in fiscal year '21. So we're really focused on expanding our value proposition, deepening our relationships and growing operating income as we look at fiscal year '21.  
And then also, one thing that is important to note is, as you look at fiscal year '21 growth, when we do come out with guidance compared to fiscal year '20, as we did have a meaningful PharMEDium benefit in fiscal year '20. It was, as I said in the prepared remarks, about $9 million in the June quarter, about $18 million expected in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the fiscal year. So that's another thing to take into account. And then I think you had a follow-up on specialty."

In some of the other businesses, it was a little bit different. Some of the Besse-based businesses they were a bit weaker, but we're now seeing them really lift up. And I'd say that just going into July, this -- the trends have stabilized. So there was a pent-up demand. So we saw some really strong numbers and it's not like that. It's not like we saw you where it's going to keep on going up high.  
So it's back to pre-COVID levels and I think that -- again, if you have MS, if you have muscular degeneration, obviously, if you have a chemotherapy treatments, those are incredibly important. And as soon as you feel at all safe, you're going to return.  
One thing that's very interesting is that the distribution of services into the community for specialty is unique in this country, and it's proven, I think, very durable for the patients. And that's what we've always, I'm trying to make the point that it's very important that patients can access care where they need to. And I think in this crisis, a lot of patients felt a lot safer going to the physician's office than they went into a health system or even a larger outpatient system. So it's a good example of the resiliency of the U.S. health care system, the way that we have such strong community practices. So, thank you."

So of course, these things don't happen overnight. 
There's also a lot of environmental issues. There's the cost issue, which I think everyone has always taken very seriously. The global supply chain has become incredibly complex. And of course, AmerisourceBergen will work with policymakers, offer our services as we have, offer our expertise and also work with the industry. So to see if there are any major changes. And if there are, then it would have to be done through a statute. So it would have to be done through the legislative process. So we would be involved in that. So, thank you."

We probably wouldn't play as prominent a role.  
You should know, of course, that we have been involved in active discussions with manufacturers as we start to plan. It's probably, -- to be honest, it's an event that I think AmerisourceBergen would be very galvanized and excited around just as part of the health care community and the smart global citizens. You hear that there could be emergency-use authorization for the first candidate for health care workers. And whatever it is, we have the capabilities.

So there's a lot of other companies besides our 2 best known peers that do vaccine distribution.  
So also, the manufacturers do, do some of that direct. But the flu vaccine, it is not material to ABC. It's not a very expensive product. It is somewhat difficult to manage. I was responsible -- I have responsibility from managing it for years because it was in our ASD division, which reported into me. And we would literally start working on it as that -- as the season ended. We started working on bookings and the issues with the manufacturing, the strains, but it's not material to ABC. About 40% to 45% of the country as you know, gets the vaccine, and we expect that it could be higher this year, and we hope it will be higher this year or so. That's really it.

If you look at the overall -- the grand scheme of the marketplace, there's not very significant market share service. Of course, in March, we saw our mail uptick quite significantly, and it is well documented that there was an increase in the 90-day scripts. 
However, the counterargument to that is there is an increase in patient adherence, which is very good for business. And certainly, one of the things when -- I remember when I first became CEO and I talked to our Good Neighbor Pharmacy group, I said, ""You guys have to do 90-day scripts."" And at that time. 10 years ago, I must say then people would -- pharmacists weren't as interested in the 90-day scripts. But it's certainly something that has become more common in the market, as you know.  
And again, we would point to the unique role that the community pharmacists have today as one of the most trusted and accessible health care professionals and literally with very good value. I mean, you can go and pick up your generic prescription and pay a $5 co-pay in most cases and get access to a professional at your independent pharmacy.

Seniors are on Medicaid often, and they have supplemental insurance, and they are sometimes not employed or they have their retirement set. And we don't -- as you well know, we don't really differentiate between a Medicaid, but we're selling in aggregate. So it doesn't really matter to us what coverage it is, but I would agree with you that it's very important that patients continue to access coverage.

Importantly, we would like to start by, first of all, acknowledging the exceptional efforts of our associates to support our customers and help them navigate the challenges stemming from COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2020, we once again delivered strong performance given large part our continued ability to innovate and execute. and inherent resilience of our business, driven by our purpose and guiding principles, our associates stepped up whenever we challenge to address the unprecedented circumstances facing our industry. Thank you to them, we've been able to meet stakeholder needs while enabling the continuity and stability of the supply chain. and demonstrating the vital nature of our role in a health system as an invisible pillar for pharmaceutical innovation and access. 
When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, we put the health, safety and well-being of our associates and customers first. We implemented enhanced an protocols and supported associates by providing additional pay can for associates needing to care or care for family members. Bonuses for some frontline associates and back a depending case. We also shifted all suitable roles for remote work. Feedback from our focus on these measures have been overwhelmingly positive. More than 90% of our associates survey take communication, collaboration and creativity and innovation have remained the same or better. We also understood and appreciated our opportunity to deliver on our purpose and we find the solution given our central role in the supply chain. In addition to our normal supplier portal and process, our teams have ensured that critical medications are allocated on a propriety space to facilitate patient access. 
On the pharmaceutical distribution side, our policy to provide real-time data and analytics that helps facilitate actionable channel solutions and awareness for commercial and government stakeholders. At World Courier, our team has in helping manufacture partners navigate the complexity of moving material across the globe with limited global air traffic. while also enhancing innovation with clinical trials in at-home settings. We believe the strength of AmerisourceBergen targeted portfolio, combined with our dynamic operating agility have demonstrated our businesses resilience and our long-standing commitment to robust business continuity plan and investments. Our stakeholders now have an even greater appreciation for our vital role in the supply chain and in the health care system overall, I'm especially proud of their inspiration and diligent efforts of our associates. We have supported our customers with increased collaboration and innovative solutions, ensuring that they're able to meet patient needs, even if they're adapted to the new environment. 
I would now like to comment on some of the recent developments regarding the potential global framework for only litigation resolution. We have made significant progress in the fourth quarter towards reaching a potential settlement to resolve our [indiscernible]. As a result, the company determined it was appropriate to accrue for this potential sale a framework that we think is workable for all the related parties. And balance discussions are ongoing, and we are not able to comment easily on the matter at this time. We take comfort from our belief that settlement fines will be used in support of initiatives to comment the opioid epidemic, including increasing, rehabilitation, mental health and other important efforts. As you all know, we have been consistent in stating our desire to be a part of the solution to address the enormity of the opioid challenge. We always have and will continue to take our role of supply chain seriously and continue to work diligently and alongside our industry partners and government and state agencies to combat, drive our version. We will also continue to support real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities we serve, work in and core power. 
Just to reiterate, we believe that this is an important step towards resolution, which would allow our business and our people to focus on performing our vial role in the health care system. which has been clearly on display during the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, AmerisourceBergen enters fiscal 2021 with strong momentum as our key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders. First, we have the best customer base in the industry, with a balanced portfolio of key end to customers across all the segments in which we operate with our diverse and extensive customer base, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support patient access wherever a prescription is needed. Today, I would like to highlight our good labor pharmacy network of independent pharmacies. In September, we held our first virtual court fine. Our annual [indiscernible] performance conference and trade show. Throughout fourth quarter, I was implied by the unweighted commitment that our GMP pharmacies can maintain with their patients and communities. They've gone above and beyond with the entrepreneurial spirit and adapted to the pandemic environment with innovations such as leveraging social media to engage with their patients, making and distributing hand sanitizers to full supply gas and adjusting to enable drive-through prescriptions. We share this permit driven mindset of our GMP pharmacies and will continue to support all of our customers by understanding their needs, delivering a seamless experience and deepening our relationship with them. 
Second, we continue to go AmerisourceBergen unparalleled leading specialty franchise. Enhanced by the value-added services we provide, our specialty physician services business has the strongest portfolio of service and customer relationships in the industry. Our position in the market enables us to capitalize on emerging trends such as the rise of biosimilars, where we saw better-than-expected adoption and growth this year and which has become a meaningful and growing part of our business. A recent our report focused on biosimilars highlighted the strong utilization trends, expected overall growth for biosimilars and a corresponding savings that they will create for the health care system. The growth of biosimilars is a long-term driver for AmerisourceBergen as we are able to provide valuable commercialization services upstream to manufacturers and support access downstream to community-based providers. 
Specialty has been an important driver of AmerisourceBergen's growth over the last few years. And in fiscal 2021, we are focused on furthering our value proposition and supporting our specialty physician customer base by continuing to invest in technology, innovation and data and analytics solutions. Our ability to continuously innovate is our base differentiator. We embrace advanced technologies to enable real-time communication and transparency for our partners. Our sourcing and distribution teams integrate their commercial expertise with our data and analytics capabilities to provide actionable channel insights to our provider and manufacturer partners and government stakeholders. During this week, AmerisourceBergen was selected by the Department of Health and Human Services to store, manage and distribute pharmaceuticals for the strategic national stockpile. We take great pride in detail to support the government in their planned pharmaceutical stockpile activity. 
AmerisourceBergen is a trusted data provider in the pharmaceutical supply. We're staying holders across the health system used to enable data-driven solutions to new and existing challenges. We also continue to modify our partnerships to become even more efficient and to serve our customers with greater speed, efficiency and data capabilities. Having an innovative mindset means that not only do we seek creative ways to solve problems, but although that we are decisive and nimble to apply our capabilities. During the pandemic, for example, we quickly launched telehealth tools, we faced virtual platforms and other technology solutions helping providers across our customer spectrum from specialty position services to MWI Animal Health adapt to the new environment. AmerisourceBergen server remains solutions are in and committed to providing value-added innovations and services so that our customers can take advantage of the opportunities available in a rapidly evolving marketing. 
Finally, turning to our port differentiator. We have a history of successful corporate stewardship. On the financial side, we have maintained our thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment with a focus on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This fiscal year, we invested $370 million in the business through capital expenditures, while at the same time returning more than $760 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the [indiscernible] community side, we are guided by our purpose. We can gain our associates, operate in a sustainable and responsible manner and support healthy and resilient communities where we live and work, We are making positive improvements for the environment and in our communities. In the last year, we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5%. 
Earlier, I mentioned the associate satisfaction with our COVID response. We have also seen a marked improvement in engagement on topics of personal modes, such as diversity and inclusion. Membership in our employee recourse groups, for example, has increased by more than 40% year-over-year In addition, inspired by our recent conversations with associates around social injectors and ration and equity, we have exciting plans for more diversity and inclusion initiatives in the coming year. This week, we appointed a new Chief Obesity and Inclusion Officer, and we look forward to working with him to continue our progress and focus in this important area. There's value generated by the power of difference. And we believe that fostering an environment that embraces diversity, inclusion, addressing unconscious buyers, advances our purpose and our culture makes us an even better AmerisourceBergen.

Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results and to provide fiscal 2021 highlights. Jim?"
24809,690990101,2130107,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen in fiscal 2020 was a year of resilience made possible by diligent execution of associates across our organization, enhanced by the exceptional performance they delivered across our businesse",2052,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen in fiscal 2020 was a year of resilience made possible by diligent execution of associates across our organization, enhanced by the exceptional performance they delivered across our businesses. And filing our purpose, our associates adapted and innovated to meet the needs of our customers and their patients. Our team strengthened our relationships with partners, both upstream and down, focusing on providing transparency and solutions at a time they need it most. AmerisourceBergen's long history of internal investment helps support this important work and enabled us to establish road business continuity plans, which utilize our efficient and modernized distribution network and our strong IT infrastructure. I think great pride in being part of such a purpose-driven company and have been humbled by the results that our teams have delivered. 
Before I delve into these results, please note that my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year period for a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release, which was published earlier today. 
Moving now to our fourth quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.89, an increase of 17%, primarily due to higher operating income. Our consolidated revenue was $29.2 billion, up 8%, driven by solid revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which includes our global commercialization services and animal health group book businesses. Gross profit increased $0.06 to $1.3 billion, driven by gross profit growth in each operating segment resulting from higher revenue. 
Consolidated operating income was $530 million, up $74 million or 16% driven by the performance of both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health group. 
Moving now to income taxes. Our income tax rate was 21.7% due to an unfavorable discrete up from 19.6% in the prior year quarter, which included a favorable discrete item. Our adjusted diluted share count increased by 3.3 million shares or 2% to 206.4 million shares driven by opportunistic share repurchases earlier in the fiscal year, notably when the share price came under pressure with the market in the month of March. For the year, we repurchased $420 million of our shares. In fiscal 2020, as Steve mentioned, AmerisourceBergen returned over $760 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. And this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. This completes the review of our consolidated results. 
Now I'll cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $47 billion, up 8%. The segment continues to benefit from strong specialty product sales including growth in specialty business services as well as overall customer growth, particularly with some of our larger customers. Fourth quarter revenue growth benefited from an easier comparison to the prior year quarter, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our largest mail order financing customer had already seemed volume from 1 fair large health plans roll off and we had not yet onboarding the customers post-merger incremental volume. Normalizing for the comparison, revenue growth would still have been at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range. Segment operating income increased about 15% to $426 million. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had an $18 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharMEDium business. In addition, as we called out back in May, we established an incremental bad debt reserve in the March quarter related to the onset of COVID-19. The incremental reserve was not related to any specific customers but due to a point-in-time analysis of potential receivables risk. As a result of the continued financial resilience of our customers, we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a significant portion of this bad debt reserve. If you were to back out the tailwind from the PharMEDium exit and the benefit from the bad debt reversal, segment operating income growth in the quarter would have been more in line with segment revenue growth. 
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on global commercialization services and animal health including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI Animal Health. In the quarter, total revenue was $2 billion, up 11% primarily due to growth at MWI and World Courier but also reflecting growth across the group. MWI's revenue grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in the companion animal business as well as growth in the production animal business. The global commercialization services, which includes World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting businesses had revenue growth in the mid-teens. The Other segment had operating income of $105 million, an increase of 20%. World Courier continued its exceptional performance in the quarter. 
This completes the review of our segment results for the quarter. Before I turn to our full year fiscal 2020 results, I want to take a moment to discuss our expense accrual in connection with opioid losses. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a GAAP pretax charge of $6.6 billion, which is excluded from our adjusted non-GAAP results. The company is in advanced discussions with are ongoing to reach a global settlement to resolve cases currently filed and that could be filed in the future by space counties, municipalities and other governmental entities covered by the settlement. The decision to record the charge is due to the significant progress made during the fourth fiscal quarter toward reaching a potential settlement our determination that a loss is now possible and the amount is reasonably estimable. The global settlement remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward. Due to the ongoing work towards settlement, we are unable to comment further on these matters at this time. 
Now I will turn to our full year fiscal 2020 performance. Our consolidated revenue was $189.9 million, up 6%, driven by growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, particularly in specialty physician services and also for our largest customers, Walgreens and Express Scripts. Consolidated operating income grew 7% for the year to $2.2 billion, while our operating margin increased 2 basis points. As it relates to operating expenses, we did experience a favorable impact from lower-than-expected corporate administrative costs, which resulted in a modest expense growth for the year. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income grew 8% and Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health had operating income growth of 5%. 
From a segment perspective, we saw growth across our businesses and pharmaceutical distribution. This segment continues to benefit from our strategic relationships in each customer segment and strong performance in specialty physician services where innovation and demographics continue to be organic growth drivers. In addition, we had notable contribution from biosimilar utilization in fiscal 2020 as we saw better-than-expected uptake of biosimilars, particularly in oncology. Another, World Courier continues to differentiate itself with key solutions in a complex world for global specialty logistics. Our manufacturing partners are leveraging our capabilities to enable at-home clinical trials and support treatment accessibility through World Permian. Indefinite we have made over the last few years have positioned our World Courier business to offer best-in-class for our manufacturer customers along with the expertise and capabilities needed to help navigate an increasingly complex environment for global specialty logistics. The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.8% and relatively consistent to 20.6% in the prior fiscal year. 
Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS from 11% to $7.90 primarily due to the resilience and outstanding execution throughout our businesses that enabled us to deliver strong operating income growth. Our EPS also benefited from lower net interest expense and a lower share count with share count down by 2%. Adjusted cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion higher than expected primarily due to timing of customer and supplier payments. The timing benefit helps fiscal 2020 adjusted free cash flow and results in slightly lower adjusted free cash flow expectations for fiscal 2021, which we expect to be $1.5 billion. Again, I am proud of the way our associates and teams have executed and adapted to deliver strong fiscal 2020 results. 
As we enter fiscal 2021, we have some momentum and visibility to continue our growth trajectory in both of our operating segments. Before detailing our guidance, I will note that our working assumption for pharmaceutical pricing in fiscal 2021 is an brand inflation and generic deflation rates will each be similar to what was experienced in fiscal 2020. 
Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2021 financial guidance. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis to all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP is. Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range. Next, operating expenses. We expect consolidated operating expenses to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. We do not expect the same level of favorability from lower corporate and administrative costs experienced in fiscal 2020 to repeat, understanding the importance of expense management. We will certainly be thoughtful in trying to have operating expense growth in the lower part of that mid-single-digit percent range. However, in fiscal 2021, we will continue to be diligent protecting our associates and thoughtful on how we do the life to continue remote work for our associates that are not on the front line. 
Regarding operating income, we expect for operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range, with mid-single-digit percent growth expected for both of our operating segments. In Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, particularly specialty physician services and benefit from our key anchor customer relationships across pharmaceutical distribution. As it relates to the impact from exiting PharMEDium, we will experience a $20 million operating income tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as we left the last quarter in our financials prior to the PharMEDium exit. 
Moving now to other. The global commercialization service as an animal health group is expected to continue its positive trajectory in fiscal 2021 and supported by continued execution from MWI, World Courier and our businesses within consulting as the businesses continue supporting our commercial partners and successfully reversing the COVID-19 landscape. 
Turning now to our consolidated tax rate expectation. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. Regarding share count, As a reminder, we do not include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance. Our fiscal 2021 guidance assumes that we finish the year between 206 million and 207 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a result of these expectations, we are guiding our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.20 to $8.45 reflecting growth of 4% to 7%. 
Finally, turning to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. First, CapEx is expected to be about $400 million. We have many projects in place, and there is no 1 project driving our capital expenditure. Rather, they have a shared focus on supporting growth, increasing efficiency or enhancing our commercial and compliance capabilities. AmerisourceBergen's balanced approach to capital deployment, which prioritizes internal investment as an important commercial and financial differentiator for us. Now for adjusted free cash flow, we expect our adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2021 to be approximately $1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, the timing that helped fiscal 2020 cash flow to be higher than expected has an offsetting impact on fiscal 2021. 
In closing, we have seen firsthand this year how valuable AmerisourceBergen's purpose driven, talent and culture are to delivering differentiated value to all our stakeholders. Strong upon our adaptability in resilience, openness and dedication as professionals, we continue to deliver for all of our partners and come together as individuals to embrace our differences. I'm confident that we are furthering our talent and culture as we become a more unified AmerisourceBergen. The fundamentals of our business remains strong as we continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, key partnerships and leadership in specialty. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to continue to create long-term shareholder value and deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Steve for some final remarks. Steve?"

I guess maybe just to start on guidance in the Pharma segment. You're calling for mid-single-digit EBIT growth there. Wanted to just get a little bit more on your thoughts around the underlying assumptions versus some of the more onetime items, typically thinking about things like lapping PharMEDium which you mentioned and then obviously, additional COVID costs from this year that might not recur at the same level, at least for next year. And then I guess to the upside, I know, Steve, you continue to talk about the growing opportunity with biosimilars. I was hoping maybe you could also touch on what, if anything, is considered in that opportunity for for fiscal '21?"
24809,690990101,2130107,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Sure.

Well, Bob, this is Jim, and I'll start with some of your questions you asked on guidance and then turn it over to Steve for your final part of the question. So fiscal year '21 financial guidance. I mean it reflects strong growth across multiple businesses, building upon the momentum from the strong fiscal year '20 despite the COVID-19 challenges. And if you know, we're guiding to mid-single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit operating income growth, and that mid-single-digit operating income growth is both in Pharma Distribution segment and another. And adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $8.20 to $8.45 and keeping in mind there that we don't include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance. So in terms of pharmaceutical distribution, some of the things that are driving it. We continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric positioning, particularly from our leadership in specialty, where we're seeing biosimilars continuing to contribute meaningfully. We're expecting pharmaceutical utilization trends generally consistent with the experience we had in fiscal year '20. We're assuming that brand inflation and generic deflation levels that they are in line with what we saw in fiscal year '20. And we will have a tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 from the exit of PharMEDium. And so that will be a benefit of $20 million in operating income tailwind comparing of the first quarter of '21 with the first quarter of '20. And then we continue to remain disciplined on expense management. We work, and I'm strongly encouraged by our OpEx performance in fiscal year '20 and continue to remain focused on expense management. We're unlikely to have the same level of favorability related to some of the corporate and administrative expenses in fiscal year '21 that we had in fiscal year '20, like our internal health care expenses would be an example of that, but we continue to expect to perform well on the OpEx front. 
And so if we look also kind of a quarterly cadence I would say that the first quarter will be a bit stronger because we have the tailwind compared to first quarter of fiscal year related to PharMEDium. And then the second quarter will be a little bit tougher because we're comparing to the second quarter fiscal year '20 where in March, we had elevated sales with the onset of COVID."

We ended fiscal year '20 with a trailing 3-year average adjusted return on invested capital of over 18%. And I think we are well positioned for capital deployment ending fiscal year '20 with 0 net debt."

I mean it's interesting that we're referring to the past 12 months with all the currencies that we've had, not necessarily for AmerisourceBergen but in our society as a normal year. But look, the resilience of our businesses were truly on display. We had, of course, the spike in March and in the soft dish April and May. And if you go back to those times, the confusion that we had. So I think we've had also in [ 2001 ], we had the fiscal crisis in the worldwide recession. And our business was extremely recession-proof those times as well. And payers keep paying our customers keep on seeing their patients and keep on really finding ways to access patients. So I think if you think about fiscal year '20, the resiliency overall, the way that some of our businesses that were a bit softer, including, say, even our production animal health businesses came back. Those are all very important to us and I think a good reason why we farmed away we did. 
If you look at fiscal year '21, we expect that overall providers will be able to navigate through any surge in the virus in patient loads, very effectively. I think that we're much more aware of patient treatment is more effective therapies that are available and that have been improved or merger utilization and even now 1 or FDA utilization. So we're quite optimistic about our providers abilities to sustain and manage through any prolonged COVID crisis. 
And then some of the trends that we've talked about, we've talked about them a lot, including our portfolio of customers and the business. We are in the pharmaceutical centric and our ability to do incredible business continuity planning, which should not be underestimated. I think, positions us very well. Jim also you have a comment?"

And so as we look to seasonality this upcoming year, you've commented, we do have tailwind, the $20 million tailwind in the first quarter from exit of PharMEDium. In the second quarter, we do have a little bit more of a tougher comp because as we've commented before, we saw a sales spike in the month of March last year with the onset of COVID. So that creates a little bit tougher comp during the second quarter. But I think really kind of the key thing is the resilience of the business. And of course, we track the volumes in all of our businesses very closely, and we've just seen strong resilience in fiscal year '20 that we would expect to continue in fiscal year '21 in this environment. 
And then on generic deflation, the question asked on generic deflation. We saw generic deflation moderate, as we've commented during fiscal year '20 and our expectation for fiscal year '21 is for generic deflation to be consistent with what we saw in fiscal year '20.

Today, we will be discussing AmerisourceBergen's strong performance in fiscal 2020 and our expectations for fiscal 2021. Importantly, we would like to start by, first of all, acknowledging the exceptional efforts of our associates to support our customers and help them navigate the challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
In fiscal 2020, we once again delivered strong performance due in large part to our continued ability to innovate and execute, an inherent resilience of our business. Driven by our purpose and guiding principles, our associates stepped up whenever we're challenged to address the unprecedented circumstances facing our industry. Thanks to them, we've been able to meet stakeholder needs while enabling the continuity and stability of the supply chain and demonstrating the vital nature of our role in a health system as an invisible pillar for pharmaceutical innovation and access.
When the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, we put the health, safety and well being of our associates and customers first. We implemented enhanced, clean protocols and supported associates by providing additional pay power for associates who needed quarantine or care for family members, bonuses for frontline associates and back up dependent case. We also shifted all suitable roles for remote work. Feedback from our associates on these measures have been overwhelmingly positive.
More than 90% of our associates surveyed say communication, collaboration and creativity and innovation have remained the same or better. We also understood and appreciated our opportunity to deliver on our purpose and be part of the solution, given our central role in the supply chain. In addition to our normal supplier portion and process, our teams have ensured that critical medications are allocated on a propriety basis to facilitate patient access.
On the pharmaceutical distribution side, our ability to provide real-time data and analytics has helped facilitate actionable channel solutions and awareness for commercial and government stakeholders. At World Courier, our team has been helping manufacture partners navigate the complexity of moving materials across the globe with limited global air traffic while also enabling innovation with clinical trials in at-home settings.
We believe the strength of AmerisourceBergen's diverse portfolio, combined with our dynamic operating agility, have demonstrated our businesses resilience and our longstanding commitment to robust business continuity plan and investments. Our stakeholders now have an even greater appreciation for our vital role in the supply chain and in the health care system overall. I am especially proud of the inspiration and diligent efforts of our associates. We have supported our customers with increased collaboration and innovative solutions, ensuring that they're able to meet patient needs, even if they're adapted to the new environment.
I would now like to comment on some of the recent developments regarding the potential global framework for opioid litigation resolution. We have made significant progress in the fourth quarter towards reaching a potential settlement to resolve our opioid lawsuits. As a result, the company determined it was appropriate to accrue for this potential settlement based on a framework that we think is workable for all the related parties. Advanced discussions are ongoing, and we are not able to comment easily on the matter at this time.
We take comfort from our belief that settlement fines will be used in support of initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic, including treatment, rehabilitation, mental health and other important efforts. As you all know, we have been consistent in stating our desire to be a part of the solution to address the enormity of the opioid challenge. We always have and will continue to take our role of supply chain seriously and continue to work diligently and alongside our industry partners and government and state agencies to combat drug diversion. We will also continue to support real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities we serve, work and core power them.
Just to reiterate, we believe that this is an important step towards resolution, which would allow our business and our people to focus on performing our vital role in the health care system, which has been clearly on display during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Looking ahead, AmerisourceBergen enters fiscal 2021 with strong momentum as our key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders. First, we have the best customer base in the industry, with a balanced portfolio of key end customers across all the segments in which we operate. With our diverse and extensive customer base, AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to support patient access wherever a prescription is needed.
Today, I would like to highlight our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network of independent pharmacies. In September, we held our first Virtual ThoughtSpot. Our annual Good Neighbor Pharmacy Conference and Trade Show. Throughout ThoughtSpot, I was implied by the unwavering commitment that our GMP pharmacies had maintained with their patients and communities. They've gone above and beyond with the entrepreneurial spirit and adapted to the pandemic environment with innovations, such as leveraging social media, to engage with their patients, making and distributing hand sanitizers to all supply base and adapting to enable drive-through prescriptions. We shared this purpose-driven mindset of our GMP pharmacies and will continue to support all of our customers by understanding their needs, delivering a seamless experience and deepening our relationship with them.
Second, we continue to involve our AmerisourceBergen's unparalleled leading specialty franchise. Enhanced by the value-added services we provide, our specialty physician services business has the strongest portfolio of service and customer relationships in the industry. Our position in the market enables us to capitalize on emerging trends, such as the rise of biosimilars, where we saw better-than-expected adoption and growth this year and which has become a meaningful and growing part of our business.
A recent IQVIA report focused on biosimilars highlighted the strong utilization trends, expect an overall growth for biosimilars and a corresponding savings that they will create for the health care system. The growth of biosimilars is a long-term driver for AmerisourceBergen as we are able to provide valuable commercialization services upstream to manufacturers and support access downstream to community-based providers.
Specialty has been an important driver of AmerisourceBergen's growth over the last few years. And in fiscal 2021, we are focused on furthering our value proposition and supporting our specialty physician customer base by continuing to invest in technology, innovation and data and analytics solutions.
Our ability to continuously innovate is our third differentiator. We embrace advanced technologies to enable real-time communication and transparency for our partners. Our sourcing and distribution teams integrate their commercial expertise with our data and analytics capabilities to provide actionable channel insights to our provider and manufacture partners and government stakeholders. During this week, AmerisourceBergen was selected by the Department of Health and Human Services to store, manage and distribute pharmaceuticals for the Strategic National Stockpile. We take great pride in being chosen to support the government in their planned pharmaceutical stockpile activity.
AmerisourceBergen is a trusted data provider in the pharmaceutical supply chain, with stakeholders across the health system used to enable data-driven solutions to new and existing challenges. We also continue to solidify our partnerships to become even more efficient and to serve our customers with greater speed, efficiency and data capabilities. Having an innovative mindset means that not only do we seek creative ways to solve problems, but also that we are decisive and nimble to apply our capabilities.
During the pandemic, for example, we quickly launched telehealth tools, face-to-face virtual platforms and other technology solutions helping providers across our customer spectrum from specialty position services to MWI Animal Health adapt to the new environment. AmerisourceBergen remains solutions-oriented and committed to providing value-added innovations and services so that our customers can take advantage of the opportunities available in this rapidly evolving market.
Finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. We have a history of successful corporate stewardship. On the financial side, we have maintained our thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment with a focus on value creation and maintaining financial strength. This fiscal year, we invested $370 million in the business through capital expenditures, while at the same time returning more than $760 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
On the key community side, we are guided by our purpose. We engaged our associates to operate in a sustainable and responsible manner and support healthy and resilient communities where we live and work. We are making positive improvements for the environment and in our communities. In the last year, we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5%.
Earlier, I mentioned the associate satisfaction with our COVID response. We have also seen a marked improvement in engagement on topics of personal importance, such as diversity and inclusion. Membership in our Employee Resource Groups, for example, has increased by more than 40% year-over-year. In addition, inspired by our recent conversations with our associates around social injustice and racial inequity, we have exciting plans for more diversity and inclusion initiatives in the coming year. Just this week, we appointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and we look forward to working with him to continue our progress and focus in this important area. There's value generated by the power of difference. And we believe that fostering an environment that embraces diversity, inclusion and addressing unconscious bias advances our purpose and our culture making us an even better AmerisourceBergen.
As we enter fiscal 2021, the evolving health care landscape continues to offer opportunities for AmerisourceBergen to leverage our strengths and capitalize on our unique position in the market. We are focused on several key adjacencies supporting growth across the enterprise by enhancing our market-leading specialty portfolio of innovative customer-centric services and solutions and deepening our strong strategic partnerships; furthering our execution excellence by reinforcing our ability to deliver best-in-class service and efficiency; three, continuing to strengthen our associates' experience with a conservative effort to advance our talent and culture; and fourth, evolving our technology and communications to further the interoperability of our businesses and to become an even more unified AmerisourceBergen.
Most of all, we remain purpose-driven and well positioned to create significant stakeholder value. Our businesses and teams rose to the challenges of the year and went above and beyond to deliver support and results for our customers and their patients. Thank you to our associates for their dedication, inspirational efforts and execution and for remaining united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results and to provide fiscal 2021 guidance. Jim?"
24809,690990101,2130465,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2020 was a year of resilience made possible by the diligent execution of associates across our organization, enhanced by the exceptional performance they delivered across our busines",2054,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For AmerisourceBergen, fiscal 2020 was a year of resilience made possible by the diligent execution of associates across our organization, enhanced by the exceptional performance they delivered across our businesses. And following our purpose, our associates adapted and innovated to meet the needs of our customers and their patients. Our team strengthened our relationships with partners, both upstream and down, focusing on providing transparency and solutions at a time they needed it most. AmerisourceBergen's long history of internal investment helps support this important work and enabled us to establish robust business continuity plans, which utilized our efficient and modernized distribution network and our strong IT infrastructure. I take great pride in being part of such a purpose-driven company and have been humbled by the results that our teams have delivered.
Before I delve into these results, please note that my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. Growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year period. For a discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings release, which was published earlier today.
Moving now to our fourth quarter results. We finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.89, an increase of 17%, primarily due to higher operating income. Our consolidated revenue was $49.2 billion, up 8%, driven by solid revenue growth in both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and other, which includes our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group of businesses. Gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion, driven by gross profit growth in each operating segment resulting from higher revenue.
Consolidated operating income was $530 million, up $74 million or 16%, driven by the performance of both the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment and our Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group.
Moving now to income taxes. Our income tax rate was 21.7% due to an unfavorable discrete item, up from 19.6% in the prior year quarter, which included a favorable discrete item. Our adjusted diluted share count increased by 3.3 million shares or 2% to 206.4 million shares driven by opportunistic share repurchases earlier in the fiscal year, notably when the share price came under pressure with the market in the month of March. For the year, we repurchased $420 million of our shares. In fiscal 2020, as Steve mentioned, AmerisourceBergen returned over $760 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. And this morning, we also announced that the company's Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. This completes the review of our consolidated results.
Now I'll cover our segment results. Beginning with Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. Segment revenue was $47 billion, up 8%. The segment continues to benefit from strong specialty product sales, including growth in specialty physician services as well as overall customer growth, particularly with some of our larger customers. Fourth quarter revenue growth benefited from an easier comparison to the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our large mail order pharmacy customer had already seemed volume from one of their large health plans roll off and we had not yet onboarded the customer's post-merger incremental volume. Normalizing for the comparison, revenue growth would still have been at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range.
Segment operating income increased about 15% to $426 million. As a reminder, the segment's operating income had an $18 million tailwind due to the exit of the PharMEDium business. In addition, as we called out back in May, we established an incremental bad debt reserve in the March quarter related to the onset of COVID-19. The incremental reserve was not related to any specific customers but due to a point-in-time analysis of potential receivables risk. As a result of the continued financial resilience of our customers, we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a significant portion of this bad debt reserve. If you were to back out the tailwind from the PharMEDium exit and the benefit from the bad debt reversal, segment operating income growth in the quarter would have been more in line with segment revenue growth.
I will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health, including World Courier, AmerisourceBergen Consulting and MWI Animal Health. In the quarter, total revenue was $2 billion, up 11% primarily due to growth at MWI and World Courier, but also reflecting growth across the group. MWI's revenue grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in the companion animal business as well as growth in the production animal business. The Global Commercialization Services group, which includes World Courier and AmerisourceBergen Consulting businesses, had revenue growth in the mid-teens. The Other segment had operating income of $105 million, an increase of 20%. World Courier continued its exceptional performance in the quarter.
This completes the review of our segment results for the quarter. Before I turn to our full year fiscal 2020 results, I want to take a moment to discuss our expense accrual in connection with opioid lawsuits. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a GAAP pretax charge of $6.6 billion, which is excluded from our adjusted non-GAAP results. The company is in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, to reach a global settlement to resolve cases currently filed and that could be filed in the future by states, counties, municipalities and other governmental entities covered by the settlement. The decision to record the charge is due to the significant progress made during the fourth fiscal quarter toward reaching a potential settlement and our determination that a loss is now probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. The global settlement remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward. Due to the ongoing work towards settlement, we are unable to comment further on these matters at this time.
Now I will turn to our full year fiscal 2020 performance. Our consolidated revenue was $189.9 billion, up 6%, driven by growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, particularly in specialty physician services and also for our largest customers, Walgreens and Express Scripts. Consolidated operating income grew 7% for the year to $2.2 billion, while our operating margin increased 2 basis points. As it relates to operating expenses, we did experience a favorable impact from lower-than-expected corporate administrative costs, which resulted in a modest expense growth for the year. Pharmaceutical Distribution segment operating income grew 8% and Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health had operating income growth of 5%.
From a segment perspective, we saw growth across our businesses and pharmaceutical distribution. This segment continues to benefit from our strategic relationships in each customer segment and strong performance in specialty physician services where innovation and demographics continue to be organic growth drivers. In addition, we had notable contribution from biosimilar utilization in fiscal 2020 as we saw better-than-expected uptake of biosimilars, particularly in oncology.
In Other, World Courier continues to differentiate itself with key solutions in a complex world for global specialty logistics. Our manufacturer partners are leveraging our capabilities to enable at-home clinical trials and support treatment accessibility through World Courier. The investment we have made over the last few years have positioned our World Courier business to offer best-in-class solutions for our manufacturer customers along with the expertise and capabilities needed to help navigate an increasingly complex environment for global specialty logistics. The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.8% and relatively consistent to 20.6% in the prior fiscal year.
Turning now to EPS. Our full year adjusted diluted EPS increased 11% to $7.90 primarily due to the resilience and outstanding execution throughout our businesses that enabled us to deliver strong operating income growth. Our EPS also benefited from lower net interest expense and a lower share count with share count down by 2%. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion higher than expected primarily due to timing of customer and supplier payments. The timing benefit helps fiscal 2020 adjusted free cash flow and results in slightly lower adjusted free cash flow expectations for fiscal 2021, which we expect to be $1.5 billion. Again, I am proud of the ways our associates and teams have executed and adapted to deliver strong fiscal 2020 results.
As we enter fiscal 2021, we have strong momentum and visibility to continue our growth trajectory in both of our operating segments. Before detailing our guidance, I will note that our working assumption for pharmaceutical pricing in fiscal 2021 is that brand inflation and generic deflation rates will each be similar to what was experienced in fiscal 2020.
Turning now to discuss our fiscal 2021 financial guidance. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Starting with revenue. We expect consolidated revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range. Next, operating expenses. We expect consolidated operating expenses to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. We do not expect the same level of favorability from lower corporate and administrative costs experienced in fiscal 2020 to repeat. Understanding the importance of expense management, we will certainly be thoughtful in trying to have operating expense growth in the lower part of that mid-single-digit percent range. However, in fiscal 2021, we will continue to be diligent in protecting our associates and thoughtful on how we utilize continued remote work for our associates that are not on the frontline.
Regarding operating income, we expect for operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range, with mid-single-digit percent growth expected for both of our operating segments. In Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, particularly specialty physician services and benefit from our key anchor customer relationships across pharmaceutical distribution. As it relates to the impact from exiting PharMEDium, we will experience a $20 million operating income tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as we left the last quarter in our financials prior to the PharMEDium exit.
Moving now to Other. The Global Commercialization Services & Animal Health group is expected to continue its positive trajectory in fiscal 2021 supported by continued execution from MWI, World Courier and our businesses within consulting as the businesses continue supporting our commercial partners and successfully traversing the COVID-19 landscape.
Turning now to our consolidated tax rate expectation. Our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. Regarding share count, as a reminder, we do not include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance. Our fiscal 2021 guidance assumes that we finish the year between 206 million and 207 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a result of these expectations, we are guiding our fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.20 to $8.45, reflecting growth of 4% to 7%.
Finally, turning to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. First, CapEx is expected to be about $400 million. We have many projects in place, and there is no one project driving our capital expenditure, rather they have a shared focus on supporting growth, increasing efficiency for enhancing our commercial and compliance capabilities. AmerisourceBergen's balanced approach to capital deployment, which prioritizes internal investment is an important commercial and financial differentiator for us.
Now for adjusted free cash flow. We expect our adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2021 to be approximately $1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, the timing benefit that helped fiscal 2020 cash flow to be higher than expected has an offsetting impact on fiscal 2021.
In closing, we have seen firsthand this year how valuable AmerisourceBergen's purpose-driven, talent and culture are to delivering differentiated value to all our stakeholders. Drawn upon our adaptability, resilience, openness and dedication as professionals, we continue to deliver for all our partners and come together as individuals to embrace our differences. I am confident that we are furthering our talent and culture as we become an even more unified AmerisourceBergen. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, key partnerships and leadership in specialty. AmerisourceBergen is well positioned to continue to create long-term shareholder value and deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
Now I will turn the call back over to Steve for some final remarks. Steve?"

Before we open the call up for questions, I would like to share my reflections on a year that has made a lasting impact on our lives. 2020 has been a year of uncertainty and challenge for communities across the globe. During this time, AmerisourceBergen has put the needs of our associates, our customers and our communities first, from planning safe ways to work to ensuring the delivery of live-saving medication and to enabling our profits to bring relief to communities from California to Nevada.
Through our purpose, scale and expertise, we have ensured that our partners have had the connectivity, capability and data needed to think, plan and act effectively. As we work to ensure that patient needs were met across our footprint, we recognized that we were only able to do so because of the resilience of our business, which has been reinforced by our focus on pharmaceuticals, our diverse portfolio of customers and businesses, our differentiated customer experience and our leadership in specialty.
As I've said for the last few months, I've never been prouder to be a part of AmerisourceBergen.

I guess maybe just to start on guidance in the pharma segment, you're calling for a mid-single-digit EBIT growth there. Wanted to just get a little bit more on your thoughts around the underlying assumptions versus some of the more one-time items, specifically thinking about things like lapping PharMEDium, which you mentioned and then, obviously, additional COVID costs from this year that might not recur at the same level at least for next year. And then I guess to the upside, I know, Steve, you continue to talk about the growing opportunity with biosimilars. I was hoping maybe you could also touch on what, if anything, is considered in that opportunity for fiscal '21?"
24809,690990101,2130465,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Cencora, Inc.","Executives","Sure.

Well, Bob, this is Jim, and I'll start with some of your questions you asked on guidance and then turn it over to Steve for your final part of the question. So fiscal year '21 financial guidance, I mean it reflects strong growth across multiple businesses, building upon the momentum from the strong fiscal year '20 despite the COVID-19 challenges. And if you know, we're guiding to mid-single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit operating income growth, and that mid-single-digit operating income growth is both in Pharma Distribution segment and in Other. And adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $8.20 to $8.45 and keeping in mind there that we don't include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance.
So in terms of pharmaceutical distribution, again, some of the things that are driving it. We continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric positioning, particularly from our leadership in specialty, where we're seeing biosimilars continuing to contribute meaningfully. We're expecting pharmaceutical utilization trends generally consistent with the experience we had in fiscal year '20. We're assuming that brand inflation and generic deflation levels that they are in line with what we saw in fiscal year '20. We will have a tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 from the exit of PharMEDium. And so that will be a benefit of $20 million in operating income tailwind comparing of the first quarter of '21 with the first quarter of '20.
And then we continue to remain disciplined on expense management. We work -- and I'm strongly encouraged by our OpEx performance in fiscal year '20 and continue to remain focused on expense management. We're unlikely to have the same level of favorability related to some of the corporate and administrative expenses in fiscal year '21 that we had in fiscal year '20, like our internal health care expenses would be an example of that, but we continue to expect to perform well on the OpEx front.
And so if we look also kind of quarterly cadence, I would say that the first quarter will be a bit stronger because we have the tailwind compared to first quarter of fiscal year '20 related to PharMEDium. And then the second quarter will be a little bit tougher because we're comparing to the second quarter fiscal year '20 wherein March we had elevated sales with the onset of COVID."

It's really a shared focus across supporting growth. So a lot of our CapEx is about supporting both, increasing our efficiency and then enhancing our commercial and compliance capabilities.
And then in terms of capital deployment, our capital deployment strategies remain unchanged; invest in the business, strategic M&A, opportunistic share repurchase and maintaining a reasonable dividend. And one thing I think is really nice to point out is that our balanced approach to capital deployment has been a commercial and financial differentiator for us. We ended fiscal year '20 with a trailing 3-year average adjusted return on invested capital of over 18%. And I think we are well positioned for capital deployment ending fiscal year '20 with zero net debt."

I mean it's interesting that you're referring to the past 12 months with all the recurrences that we've had, not necessarily for AmerisourceBergen but in our society as a normal year. But look, the resilience of our businesses were truly on display. We had, of course, the spike in March and in the -- the softish April and May. And if you go back to those times, the confusion that we had, so I think we've had also -- in 2009, we had the fiscal crisis and the worldwide recession. And our business was extremely recession-proof in those times as well. And payers keep paying, our customers keep on seeing their patients and keep on really finding ways to access patients.
So I think if you think about fiscal year '20, the resiliency overall, the way that some of our businesses that were a bit softer, including, say, even our production, animal health businesses came back. Those are all very important to us and I think a good reason why we performed the way we did.
If you look at fiscal year '21, we expect that overall providers will be able to navigate through any surge in the virus in patient loads very effectively. I think that we're much more aware of patient treatments, more effective therapies that are available and that have been improved or brought into utilization, even now one for FDA utilization. So we're quite optimistic about our providers' abilities to sustain and manage through any prolonged COVID crisis.
And then some of the trends that we've talked about, we've talked about them a lot, including our portfolio of customers and the businesses. We are pharmaceutical centric and our ability to do incredible business continuity planning, which should not be underestimated, I think, positions us very well. Jim, I see you have a comment?"

And so as we look to seasonality this upcoming year, you've commented, we do have that tailwind, the $20 million tailwind in the first quarter from exit of PharMEDium. In the second quarter, we do have a little bit more of a tougher comp, because as we've commented before, we saw sales spike in the month of March last year with the onset of COVID. So that creates a little bit tougher comp during the second quarter. But I think really kind of the key thing is the resilience of the business. And of course, we track the volumes in all of our businesses very closely, and we've just seen strong resilience in fiscal year '20 that we would expect to continue in fiscal year '21 in this environment.
And then on generic deflation, the question you asked on generic deflation, we saw generic deflation moderate as we've commented during fiscal year '20, and our expectation for fiscal year '21 is for generic deflation to be consistent with what we saw in fiscal year '20.

So I don't think that, that was quite as directed as this comment. But on policy, I think we always go back to some of our key themes. It's really important to remember that pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of source of care. And that I think people sometimes forget -- that not you obviously, but that total health care spending, we actually are under 10% now and overall increases have been pretty reasonable. So I think those are the themes that we try to highlight.
And of course, if there were any changes that you referenced like the international pricing, those should be done thoughtfully and then transitioned in a sensitive way. So I think you've seen the market rallied yesterday on health care stocks. And I think we -- at AmerisourceBergen, we have a seat at the table, we are involved. We've really advanced in that area. We often get seen as experts on a lot of these reimbursement and policy areas as it affects our customers. And that's a big part of our focus, right?
We'll continue to advocate on behalf community-based care. We will continue to be a fair partner to pharma and buy on those sort of organizations. And we'll also look to make sure that anything that affects our industry is fairly legislated like the pedigree rule is a good example of that, things like that. So we think it's important. And also AmerisourceBergen, of course, really benefits as a mutual fund of all pharmaceutical-based spending. So we will represent in all the segments, so you should just think about that.
I think operator, we have time for -- no more questions, okay. Our Investor Relations head is putting an end to questions. So I'm going to just end up by saying we're excited to finally be in fiscal year '21. We're focused on execution and growth in fiscal year '21, which we now just completed October. Most excitingly, from a personal point of view, I remember when I joined the former Bergen Brunswig about 27 years ago that we were doing about $3 billion or $4 billion in sales. And potentially, this next year, this upcoming year when we could celebrate the 20th anniversary, we all celebrate the 20th anniversary of Amerisource and Bergen merging, we could record a $200 billion in revenues, which would be quite a momentous achievement for a 20-year-old company.
So just let me end by saying that we're excited about fiscal year '21. We'll also be opening new headquarters for our company. And we're hoping that we can celebrate together with our wonderful associates that have done such a great job throughout this year. We are well positioned to deliver growth and create stakeholder value as we are guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
