So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We like what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter. That rate of growth didn't moderate from the third quarter. And as we've discussed on our last call, we proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract more customers during that time period. Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name is with our product in a top search term drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins, either direct to site or through unpaid channels. Roughly 2/3 of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our largest channels. 
In addition to that, about half of our paid move-ins come through brand search and brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those gives us some advantages with which we are utilizing today online. 
We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really that tool, given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media and affiliates as all. So we spent a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan. As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like incremental traffic that we're seeing from the advertising spend that we'll continue to spend, and so far, in 2020, we've continued to like what we've seen. So we continue to pull on that lever, along with rental rate changes and discounting to drive traffic to our stores and what is -- what remains a challenging operating environment."

So move-in volumes were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So while move-in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays in tenants and continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well. So continued good trends there amongst the initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of customers remains challenging in this operating environment."

So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a number of different fronts, whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of our borders. You can see that from, obviously, the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again, the outlook and the desire on our part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about, yes, we have had over the last year, in particular -- particularly, strong uptick in the amount of volume that we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again, that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior 4 years. So we continue to bet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that we're seeing out in the market, and we're seeing good trends. We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So we continue to be equally focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time, if things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that, too. 
You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity. That, too, again, for 2019 with a vibrant part of our business. We brought 40 properties online, whether it's from ground-up or redevelopment, again, about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform, and we will continue, again, from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you, frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last 2 or 3 years because there is a little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets. So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at that. So overall, I mean, we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well prepared to embrace the kind of volume, and again, from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've no confusion. Our balance sheet has been and continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year, we've got some good momentum at hand."

I'll just try to answer the question around, again, the number of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over, say, the last 3 to 5 years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and frankly, the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market. So some of this comes with enduring relationships that we've got with these owners. And again, some of that's harder to predict to get to your question, well, how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that is pronounced. And I think we talked to quarter-by-quarter last year, was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious motivation to get out, right? So with that, it's, again, a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy, looking at a number of opportunities, again, with the kinds of circumstances that I've described. And we also have a number of owners have also come to us and said, ""Hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right"". And they too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of these assets. Our filters as tight as it ever has been. And frankly, with that, we're off to a good start, as you mentioned, in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year to be determined. But if you step back and look at the wave of development activity in particular that's taken place over the last 4 or 5 years, there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets, many with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business. And there are a lot of entities out there are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by, again, the amount of volume that we've seen come through, the quality of the assets, and in our view, again, the appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments."

And if you look at 2020, the size of that program will take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation assets into existing assets to get the, not only curb appeal impact, but the relevancy to our brand; the optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling, lighting, for instance; and some cases, we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment; and doing a number of different things to, again, enhance the overall quality because, frankly, we've got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we think that ultimate lift to our most recent generation 5 quality standard is very appropriate. Customers are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting through the full portfolio. And again, this program is likely to take 5 years or more to get through the portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations, higher revenue markets, where we're seeing even better impact from the investment. So all things considered, we're seeing good traction from the investment in the program, and it will continue, like I mentioned, over the next few years."

If you look back at prior year, it was 16%. And so while it did get a little bit wider. That's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably large number, but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as occupancy dips. We have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-out for a number of years, and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I think it's really a story of markets, and it's hard to talk about at a high level, what it is we're going to see for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that have been impacted by new supply, where move-in rates, we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a market that highlight is Houston and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first time in a little while, in 2019, we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north of 5% in Houston, and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter. 
We have markets like Houston, Atlanta, where the impact of new supply continues to be felt, and we have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in occupancy. The good news is, in Houston, we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now, we're sitting at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at a lower rate, and then going to flip side, a market like L.A., where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just as another snapshot in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of '18, we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth. But if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell, and you've got markets like Chicago, Denver and Dallas, that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the flip side is you continue to have Houston be a laggard, Atlanta, as I highlighted in Boston that was impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue growth in the fourth quarter but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through as a tough operating environment."

And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into '20?

We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply markets. As Tom mentioned, some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus, say, 10% down from what we saw in 2019. Again, these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to deal with supply as it impacts particular assets, say, you right down to that 3- to 5-mile trade area, you could definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly, that's where we continue to see some, not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well. 
The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall, the resiliency of our own brand, et cetera, is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago, and not ironically, those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some decent percolation. And we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York because there's more deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to, again, the ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management, pricing strategies, I mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply conditions. The outlets or the outlook or beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer deals get delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part of the market that was driving, again, share development just based on spec developers out there just flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return because there were many buyers that were basically just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say, this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down, too. So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to, maybe when they acquired that piece of land or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that hopefully, will lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions. But again, this year, in 2020, we still got the lingering impact of the supply that's been built over the last, say, 2 to 3 years. We'll have again, a number of deliveries this year. But we're highly encouraged by our own capabilities and the things that we can do uniquely enough to keep, again, this band performance at least what you've seen for the last 7 quarters in pretty tough market conditions. 
If things actually start improving, then we'll hopefully see the upside of that, too. It's too soon to tell. But again, we'll continue to use all those tools that we've got."

And some of that comes down to some initiatives tied to [indiscernible] 2. And otherwise, that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduced number of hours. But ultimately, we've continued over that time period and including last year to increase wages to to attract a competitive employee and provide a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level. So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through 2020. As always, we're working in the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best, but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020."

So separately, we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through, depending on zoning any kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that face value may look like a prime candidate, but it may be a condition where, frankly, you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you have to work through because if we're going into an asset disrupting current income, it can be quite dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well, and then counterbalance it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would guess by putting basically, whether it's some additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of, again, new gen 5 properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site. So there's a whole host of parameters that go into that, but it goes right down to a case-by-case, property-to-property base."

So there's no question that we spent more in 2019 than we did in 2018. So your point around comps as we get into 2020, is a fair one. We don't manage our advertising spend based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on what it is we're getting for it and what the return is on it in the current period. And so if we like what we're seeing, we're going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that if we like the returns. And the flip side is we're managing it dynamically. So there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend and ones where we likely increase as we get into 2020. The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue and the fact that it was 3-plus percent historically in previous cycles. And we got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016, when, frankly, we were full and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over the past several years, and we anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well.

So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We've liked what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter. That rate of growth did moderate from the third quarter and as we've discussed on our last call, we proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract more customers during that time period. 
Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name, which is synonymous with our product and a top-search term, drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins, either direct to site or through unpaid channels. Roughly 2/3 of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our largest channels. In addition to that, about 1/2 of our paid move-ins come through brand search and brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those give us some advantages with which we are utilizing today online. 
We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really like that tool, given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media and affiliates as well. So we spent a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan. 
As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like the incremental traffic that we're seeing from the advertising spend that we'll continue to spend. And so far, in 2020, we continue to like what we've seen. So I would anticipate that we continue to pull on that lever, along with rental rate changes and discounting to drive traffic to our stores in what is a -- what remains a challenging operating environment."

The move-in volumes were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So while move-in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays of existing tenants and continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well. So continued good -- good trends there amongst initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of customers remains challenging in this operating environment."

So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a number of different fronts, whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of our borders. You can see that from, obviously, the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again, the outlook and the desire on our part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about, yes, we have had over the last year, in particular -- particularly, strong uptick in the amount of volume that we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again, that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior 4 years. So we continue to vet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that we're seeing out in the market, and we're seeing good trends. 
We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So we continue to be equally focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time, if things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that too. 
You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity. That, too, again, for 2019 with a vibrant part of our business. We brought 40 properties online, whether from ground-up or redevelopment; again, about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform, and we will continue, again, from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you, frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last 2 or 3 years because there is a little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets. So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at that. 
So overall, I mean, we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well prepared to embrace the kind of volume and, again, from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've no confusion. Our balance sheet has been and continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year, we've got some good momentum at hand."

Again, the number of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over the -- say, the last 3 to 5 years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and, frankly, the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market. So some of this comes with enduring relationships that we've got with these owners. And again, some of that's harder to predict to get to your question, well, how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that it is pronounced and I think we talked to quarter-by-quarter last year, was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious motivation to get out, right? 
So with that, it's, again, a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy looking at a number of opportunities, again, with the kinds of circumstances that I described. And we also have a number of owners who have also come to us and said, ""Hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right"". And they too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of these assets. Our filter is as tight as it ever has been. And frankly, with that, we're off to a good start, as you mentioned, in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year to be determined, but if you step back and look at the wave of development activity, in particular, that's taken place over the last 4 or 5 years, there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets, many with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business. And there are a lot of entities out there who are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by, again, the amount of volume that we've seen come through, the quality of the assets and in our view, again, the appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments."

And if you look at 2020, the size of that program will take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation assets into existing assets to get the not only curb appeal impact but relevancy to our brand; the optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling, lighting, for instance; in some cases, we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment; and doing a number of different things to, again, enhance the overall quality because, frankly, we've got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we think that ultimate lift to our most recent generation 5 quality standard is very appropriate. Customers are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting through the full portfolio. And again, this program is likely to take 5 years or more to get through the portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations, higher revenue markets, where we're seeing even better impact from that investment. So all things considered, we're seeing good traction from the investment in the program, and it will continue, like I mentioned, over the next few years."

If you look back at prior year, it was 16%. And so while it did get a little bit wider. That's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably large number, but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as occupancy dips and we have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-out for a number of years, and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I think, it's really a story of markets and it's hard to talk about at a high level, what it is we're going to see for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that have been impacted by new supply, where move-in rates, we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a market that I'd highlight is Houston and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first time in a little while, in 2019, we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north of 5% in Houston, and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter. 
We have markets like Houston, Atlanta, where the impact of new supply continues to be felt, and we have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in occupancy. The good news is, in Houston, we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now, we're sitting at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at a lower rate. And then, going to flip side, a market like L.A., where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just as another snapshot in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of '18, we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth, but if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell, and you've got markets like Chicago, Denver and Dallas that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the flip side is you continue to have Houston be a laggard; Atlanta, as I highlighted and Boston that was impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue growth in the fourth quarter but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through as -- a tough operating environment."

Generally speaking, I realize the markets will change and mix around. But do you feel like the overall competitive pressure from new supply is beginning to kind of find a footing here? And maybe it doesn't get a lot worse from here? And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into '20?

We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply markets. As Tom mentioned, some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus, say, 10% down from what we saw in 2019. Again, these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to deal with supply as it impacts particular assets, say, right down to that 3- to 5-mile trade area, you could definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly, that's where we continue to see some, not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well. 
The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall, the resiliency of our own brand, et cetera, is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago; and not ironically, those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some decent percolation and we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York because there's more deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to, again, the ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management, pricing strategies. I mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply conditions. 
The outlet -- or the outlook beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer C/O deals get delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part of the market that was driving, again, share development just based on spec developers out there just flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return because there were many buyers that were basically just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say, this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down too. So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to, maybe, when they acquired that piece of land or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that, hopefully, will lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions. But again, this year, in 2020, we still got the lingering impact of the supply that's been built over the last, say, 2 to 3 years. We'll have, again, a number of deliveries this year. But we're highly encouraged by our own capabilities and the things that we can do uniquely enough to keep, again, this band performance, at least what you've seen for the last 7 quarters in pretty tough market conditions. If things actually start improving, then we'll hopefully see the upside of that too. It's too soon to tell. But again, we'll continue to use all those tools that we've got."

So as you look at labor costs in the quarter, on-site property manager payroll was up about 6%. The drivers of that was largely wages. And we've talked, for now a number of years, about the very tight labor market that we find ourselves in today nationally. There's certainly some pockets that are even tighter than the national numbers. And so what we've done over time is make sure we're being as efficient as possible. And some of that comes down to some of the initiatives tied to Web Champ 2. And otherwise that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduce number of hours. But ultimately, we've continued over that time period, and including last year, to increase wages to attract a competitive employee and provide a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level. So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through 2020. As always, we're looking at the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best, but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020."

So separately, we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through, depending on zoning, any kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that at face value may look like a prime candidate, but it may be a condition where, frankly, you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you have to work through because if we're going into an asset and disrupting current income, it can be quite dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well and then counterbalance it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would get by putting basically, whether it's some additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of, again, new gen 5 properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site.

So there's no question that we spent more in 2019 than we did in 2018. So your point around comps as we get into 2020, is a fair one. We don't manage our advertising spend based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on what it is we're getting for it and what the return is on it in the current period. And so if we like what we're seeing, we're going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that if we like the returns. And the flip side is, we're managing it dynamically. So there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend and ones where we likely increase as we get into 2020. The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue and the fact that it was 3-plus percent historically in previous cycles. And it got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016, when, frankly, we were full and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over the past several years and would anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well.

So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We've liked what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter. That rate of growth did moderate from the third quarter. And as we've discussed on our last call, we proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract more customers during that time period. 
Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name, which is synonymous with our product and a top-search term, drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins, either direct to site or through unpaid channels. Roughly 2/3 of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our largest channels. In addition to that, about 1/2 of our paid move-ins come through brand search and brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those give us some advantages with which we are utilizing today online. 
We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really like that tool, given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media and affiliates as well. So we spend a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan. 
As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like the incremental traffic that we're seeing from the advertising spend, then we'll continue to spend. And so far, in 2020, we continue to like what we're seeing. So I would anticipate that we continue to pull on that lever, along with rental rate changes and discounting, to drive traffic to our stores in what is a -- what remains a challenging operating environment."

The move-in volumes were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So while move-in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays of existing tenants and continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well. So continued good -- good trends there amongst initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of customers remains challenging in this operating environment."

So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a number of different fronts, whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of our borders. You can see that from, obviously, the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again, the outlook and the desire on our part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about, yes, we have had over the last year, in particular -- particularly strong uptick in the amount of volume that we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again, that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior 4 years. So we continue to vet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that we're seeing out in the market, and we're seeing good trends. 
We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So we continue to be equally focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time, if things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that too. 
You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity. That too, again, for 2019 was a vibrant part of our business. We brought 40 properties online, whether from ground-up or redevelopment, again about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform, and we will continue, again, from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you, frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last 2 or 3 years, because there is a little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets. So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at that. 
So overall, I mean, we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well prepared to embrace the kind of volume and, again, from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've no confusion. Our balance sheet has been and continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year, we've got some good momentum at hand."

I'll just try to answer the question around, again, the number of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over, say, the last 3 to 5 years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and, frankly, the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market. So some of this comes with enduring relationships that we've got with these owners. And again, some of that's harder to predict to get to your question, well, how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that is pronounced and I think we talked to quarter-by-quarter last year was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious motivation to get out, right? 
So with that, it's, again, a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy looking at a number of opportunities, again, with the kinds of circumstances that I've described. And we also have a number of owners who have also come to us and said, ""Hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right"". And they too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of these assets. Our filter is as tight as it ever has been. And frankly, with that, we're off to a good start, as you mentioned, in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year? To be determined. But if you step back and look at the wave of development activity in particular that's taken place over the last 4 or 5 years, there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets, many with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business. And there are a lot of entities out there who are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by, again, the amount of volume that we've seen come through, the quality of the assets, and in our view, again, the appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments."

And if you look at 2020, the size of that program will take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation assets into existing assets to get the not only curb appeal impact, but the relevancy to our brand; the optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling, lighting, for instance; in some cases, we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment; and doing a number of different things to, again, enhance the overall quality. Because, frankly, we've got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we think that ultimate lift to our most recent Generation 5 quality standard is very appropriate. Customers are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting through the full portfolio. And again, this program is likely to take 5 years or more to get through the portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations, higher revenue markets, where we're seeing even better impact from the investment. So all things considered, we're seeing good traction from the investment in the program, and it will continue, like I mentioned, over the next few years."

The gap between move-in rents in the fourth quarter and move-out rents on a per square foot basis was 17%. If you look back at prior year, it was 16%. And so while it did get a little bit wider, that's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably large number, but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as occupancy dips and we have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-out for a number of years, and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I think it's really a story of markets and it's hard to talk about, at a high level, what it is we're going to see for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that have been impacted by new supply, where move-in rates we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a market that I'd highlight is Houston, and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first time in a little while, in 2019, we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north of 5% in Houston, and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter. 
We have markets like Houston or Atlanta, where the impact of new supply continues to be felt, and we have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in occupancy. The good news is, in Houston, we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now, we're sitting at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at lower rate. And then, going to flip side, a market like L.A., where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just as another snapshot, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of '18, we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth. But if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell, and you've got markets like Chicago, Denver and Dallas that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the flip side is you continue to have Houston be a laggard; Atlanta, as I highlighted; and Boston that was impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through what is a tough operating environment."

But do you feel like the overall competitive pressure from new supply is beginning to kind of find a footing here? And maybe it doesn't get a lot worse from here? And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into '20?

We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply markets. As Tom mentioned, some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus, say, 10% down from what we saw in 2019. Again, these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to deal with supply as it impacts particular assets, say, right down to that 3- to 5-mile trade area, you could definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly, that's where we continue to see some, not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well. 
The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall, the resiliency of our own brand, et cetera, is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago. And not ironically, those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some decent percolation, and we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York, because there's more deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to, again, the ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management, pricing strategies, I mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply conditions.
The outlet -- or the outlook beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer CofO deals get delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part of the market that was driving, again, share development just based on spec developers out there just flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return, because there were many buyers that were basically just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say, this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down too. So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to maybe when they acquired that piece of land or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that hopefully will lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions.

So as you look at labor costs in the quarter, on-site property manager payroll was up about 6%. The drivers of that was largely wages. And we've talked for now a number of years about the very tight labor market that we find ourselves in today nationally. There's certainly some pockets that are even tighter than the national numbers. And so what we've done over time is make sure we're being as efficient as possible. And some of that comes down to some of the initiatives tied to Web Champ 2. And otherwise that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduce number of hours. But ultimately, we've continued over that time period, and including last year, to increase wages to attract a competitive employee and provide a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level. So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through 2020. As always, we're looking at the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best, but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020."

So separately, we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through, depending on zoning, any kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that at face value may look like a prime candidate, but it may be a condition where, frankly, you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you have to work through, because if we're going into an asset and disrupting current income, it can be quite dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well and then counterbalance it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would get by putting, basically, whether it's some additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of, again, new Gen 5 properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site.

So there's no question that we spent more in 2019 than we did in 2018. So your point around comps as we get into 2020 is a fair one. We don't manage our advertising spend based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on what it is we're getting for it and what the return is on it in the current period. And so if we like what we're seeing, we're going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that if we like the returns. And the flip side is, we're managing it dynamically. So there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend and ones where we likely increase as we get into 2020. The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue and the fact that it was 3-plus percent historically in previous cycles and it got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016 when, frankly, we were full and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over the past several years and would anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well.

So we've been communicating a pretty consistent strategy on advertising throughout 2019. We've liked what we've seen with the increase in spend through 2019. And so as we've spent more money, we liked the demand response we received from customers. Advertising was up 40% in the fourth quarter. That rate of growth did moderate from the third quarter. And as we've discussed on our last call, we proactively pulled harder on the advertising lever in the third quarter during the busy season to attract more customers during that time period.
Stepping back, we continue to have real advantages online. Our brand name, which is synonymous with our product and a top-search term, drives a meaningful portion of our move-ins, either direct to site or through unpaid channels. Roughly 2/3 of our move-ins come through unpaid channels. Those are our largest channels. In addition to that, about 1/2 of our paid move-ins come through brand search and brand advertising, which comes at a lower cost. So those give us some advantages with which we are utilizing today online.
We talk a lot about Google. Google is a primary portion of our advertising spend, and we really like that tool, given it's dynamically managed and very local and granular, so we can set our bidding strategy similar to how we set our pricing on a very local level. But in addition to that, we do utilize social media and affiliates as well. So we spend a lot of time talking about Google, but it's a broader marketing plan.
As we head into 2020, I would anticipate that if we continue to like the incremental traffic that we're seeing from the advertising spend, then we'll continue to spend. And so far, in 2020, we continue to like what we're seeing. So I would anticipate that we continue to pull on that lever, along with rental rate changes and discounting, to drive traffic to our stores in what is a -- what remains a challenging operating environment."

So move-in rate was 2.4% in the quarter, which is a little bit better than what we saw in the second and third quarters, but we did have lower move-in volumes. The move-in volumes were down 3.5% in the quarter compared to roughly flat in the second and third quarter. So while move-in volumes were down 3.5%, we continue to be benefited by lengthening stays of existing tenants and continued very good performance by existing tenants. And so move-out volumes were down 1.5% as well. So continued good -- good trends there amongst initial or existing tenants, but the initial acquisition of customers remains challenging in this operating environment."

So as an entity, we have and always will be inquisitive along a number of different fronts, whether it's within our borders here or where opportunities may lie outside of our borders. You can see that from, obviously, the investment that we made into the Shurgard platform a number of years ago. We have talked over the years about, again, the outlook and the desire on our part to continue to vet and understand markets outside of our borders. And with that, we're going to continue to look for those opportunities as they arise. Looking at the things you talked specifically about, yes, we have had over the last year, in particular -- particularly strong uptick in the amount of volume that we've done, particularly tied to acquisitions. We're seeing a healthy amount of attractive opportunities that continue to lead to the kind of volume that we did in 2019 where we bought approximately $430 million of acquisitions, 44 separate properties. And again, that's higher than the volume that we've done in the prior 4 years. So we continue to vet and leverage our relationships, leverage the amount of opportunities that we're seeing out in the market, and we're seeing good trends.
We also have a decent backlog of acquisition activity going into 2020. So we continue to be equally focused on everything that happens right here within the United States. And then from time to time, if things happen outside of our borders, we're going to take a strong look at that too.
You mentioned the development and redevelopment activity. That too, again, for 2019 was a vibrant part of our business. We brought 40 properties online, whether from ground-up or redevelopment, again about $375 million of investment. And again, if you combine that activity with the acquisition activity, we brought in about 85 additional assets into the portfolio. We think they're great additions to the platform, and we will continue, again, from the development -- redevelopment standpoint to fund that business as we're finding attractive opportunities. We're seeing good land sites that are coming to us. I would tell you, frankly, we're seeing more of those right now than we have in the last 2 or 3 years, because there is a little bit of rewinding relative to some of the spec development that has been going on in certain markets. So we're seeing a number of additional land sites that are attractive. So we're going to continue to look at that.
So overall, I mean, we've got a number of very positive things happening. The management team is well prepared to embrace the kind of volume and, again, from a capital allocation standpoint, the way that we can drive good returns to our shareholders. And we've no confusion. Our balance sheet has been and continues to be ready to fund a whole range of different capital allocation initiatives. So we continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing out there. And like I said, looking at the beginning of this year, we've got some good momentum at hand."

I'll just try to answer the question around, again, the number of things that are driving the opportunity set that we've been able to capture. So we are seeing a higher level of sellers coming into the market that have either acquired or built assets over, say, the last 3 to 5 years with certain sets of expectations, many of which have not met either pro forma or have not basically put them in the position that they expect it to be in at this point. A number of the deals and, frankly, the majority of the deals that we did in 2019 were off market. So some of this comes with enduring relationships that we've got with these owners. And again, some of that's harder to predict to get to your question, well, how much volume might we see in 2020. The thing that is pronounced and I think we talked to quarter-by-quarter last year was the theme of more owners coming to us with more anxious motivation to get out, right?
So with that, it's, again, a more vibrant arena. Our acquisitions team is very busy looking at a number of opportunities, again, with the kinds of circumstances that I've described. And we also have a number of owners who have also come to us and said, ""Hey, it's been a great business. Timing is right."" And they too want to exit for a variety of different reasons. We continue to evaluate the quality and the pricing of these assets. Our filter is as tight as it ever has been. And frankly, with that, we're off to a good start, as you mentioned, in 2020. How much of that plays through for the balance of the year? To be determined. But if you step back and look at the wave of development activity in particular that's taken place over the last 4 or 5 years, there's a pretty strong collection of assets that have come into various markets, many with ownership histories that have nothing to do with long-term commitment to the storage business. And there are a lot of entities out there who are looking for exits. And we've been pleased by, again, the amount of volume that we've seen come through, the quality of the assets, and in our view, again, the appropriate time to acquire and see ultimately good returns from those investments."

And if you look at 2020, the size of that program will take another step up. So it's a multiyear program. We're embedding a number of our latest generation assets into existing assets to get the not only curb appeal impact, but the relevancy to our brand; the optimization of some of the physical characteristics of the asset where we're retooling, lighting, for instance; in some cases, we're putting solar on assets; we're optimizing the customer environment; and doing a number of different things to, again, enhance the overall quality. Because, frankly, we've got many assets that continue to do phenomenally well. And we've just gotten to the point where we think that ultimate lift to our most recent Generation 5 quality standard is very appropriate. Customers are responding well to it. Our employees are responding well to it. We're prioritizing as we're ratcheting through the full portfolio. And again, this program is likely to take 5 years or more to get through the portfolio at large. But we are prioritizing around market concentrations, higher revenue markets, where we're seeing even better impact from the investment. So all things considered, we're seeing good traction from the investment in the program, and it will continue, like I mentioned, over the next few years."

The gap between move-in rents in the fourth quarter and move-out rents on a per square foot basis was 17%. If you look back at prior year, it was 16%. And so while it did get a little bit wider, that's a seasonally wider time period. And so that obviously sounds like a reasonably large number, but we lower our rental rates seasonally through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as occupancy dips and we have vacancy to fill. So that's a strategy that we've employed year-in and year-out for a number of years, and you saw that again this year. In terms of overall move-in rate trends, I think it's really a story of markets and it's hard to talk about, at a high level, what it is we're going to see for 2020. But if you look at the different market performance in the fourth quarter, you have markets that have been impacted by new supply, where move-in rates we lowered proactively to drive volume. So a market that I'd highlight is Houston, and we're seeing some encouraging trends in Houston as it relates to year-over-year move-in performance as we went through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, but it's come at a lower rate. So fourth quarter move-in rates in Houston were down 16%. But for the first time in a little while, in 2019, we started to see real volume in Houston. So move-in volume was up north of 5% in Houston, and we're seeing better traction as we go through the first quarter.
We have markets like Houston or Atlanta, where the impact of new supply continues to be felt, and we have little pricing power in those markets where we're utilizing rate and we're utilizing advertising to fill in occupancy. The good news is, in Houston, we are getting good occupancy traction. Right now, we're sitting at 300 basis points plus year-over-year occupancy, just looking at my dashboard this morning. So getting some good occupancy traction, but it's coming at lower rate. And then, going to flip side, a market like L.A., where we had positive move-in rent growth in the fourth quarter. So stepping back, we continue to think there's going to be ebb and flows through markets as they're impacted by new supply in 2020. Just as another snapshot, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported 1.1% same-store revenue growth. In the fourth quarter of '18, we reported 1.2% same-store revenue growth. So pretty consistent revenue growth. But if you look at the contribution from the different markets, it's a barbell, and you've got markets like Chicago, Denver and Dallas that actually are the best year-over-year change in revenue growth. And the flip side is you continue to have Houston be a laggard; Atlanta, as I highlighted; and Boston that was impacted by new supply in 2019 that impacted us. So another quarter of reasonably consistent revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but the market contributions continue to shift as we navigate through what is a tough operating environment."

But do you feel like the overall competitive pressure from new supply is beginning to kind of find a footing here? And maybe it doesn't get a lot worse from here? And the question then is how quickly can it improve in '21 and beyond? Or do you still feel like there are more supply coming and there's more competitive pressures as we move into '20?

We feel like we have a strong tool kit to continue to maneuver through higher supply markets. As Tom mentioned, some of that is shifting the supply picture nationally. We'll have another strong year of deliveries in 2020. It could be plus or minus, say, 10% down from what we saw in 2019. Again, these are elevated levels of construction that we're now going into the fourth year of a range of anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion in deliveries. And again, if you don't have the right playbook to deal with supply as it impacts particular assets, say, right down to that 3- to 5-mile trade area, you could definitely have some pretty strong headwinds to deal with. And frankly, that's where we continue to see some, not all, but some of our acquisition opportunities as well.
The interesting thing and it ties to the resiliency of the product overall, the resiliency of our own brand, et cetera, is we are seeing deliveries come down in markets like Denver, Charlotte, Houston, Austin and Chicago. And not ironically, those are some of the markets now that we're actually starting to see some decent percolation, and we're encouraged by that. Now going into this next year, we've got our eyes wide open on markets like Portland, Boston, Seattle, Miami, D.C. and New York, because there's more deliveries coming to those markets, some of which haven't had the kind of development activity in quite some time. But reflecting on some of the comments Tom just walked you through relative to, again, the ways that we're using our own brand, our marketing strategies, the ways that we're improving the quality of the assets directly themselves, the way we're doing our own revenue management, pricing strategies, I mean, we continue to have ways that we feel are strong components to work through these higher supply conditions.
The outlet -- or the outlook beyond even this year is more murky. We are seeing fewer CofO deals get delivered to the market. I think that's an encouraging sign. There may be some tapering down of the part of the market that was driving, again, share development just based on spec developers out there just flipping an asset and trying to get a quick return, because there were many buyers that were basically just aggressively taking down empty facilities. That volume is down quite a bit. And part of the reason it's down, again, it's -- you could look at it and say, this is probably a healthy thing as rents are down too. So they're not making the pro formas that they intended to maybe when they acquired that piece of land or had it tied up. So there are a number of things that are starting to work through that hopefully will lead to a more balanced market-by-market set of conditions. But again, this year, in 2020, we've still got the lingering impact of the supply that's been built over the last, say, 2 to 3 years. We'll have, again, a number of deliveries this year.

So as you look at labor costs in the quarter, on-site property manager payroll was up about 6%. The drivers of that was largely wages. And we've talked for now a number of years about the very tight labor market that we find ourselves in today nationally. There's certainly some pockets that are even tighter than the national numbers. And so what we've done over time is make sure we're being as efficient as possible. And some of that comes down to some of the initiatives tied to Web Champ 2. And otherwise that we were able to utilize efficiencies and reduce number of hours. But ultimately, we've continued over that time period, and including last year, to increase wages to attract a competitive employee and provide a competitive package for employees to give our customers a good customer service at the property level. So wages is the short answer. I would anticipate that we continue to have wage pressure as we go through 2020. As always, we're looking at the ways to be more efficient and utilize the hours that we have best, but would anticipate that wages will be a pressure in 2020."

So separately, we do have all of our initiatives tied to redevelopment, which would include expansions. So -- and that does go right down to a case-by-case basis. So what comes with that is there are a whole host of roadblocks that you might have to go through, depending on zoning, any kind of approvals and opportunities to actually expand an asset that at face value may look like a prime candidate, but it may be a condition where, frankly, you just can't get the appropriate zoning and ability to expand the site itself. So that's one hurdle you have to work through. There are economic hurdles that you have to work through, because if we're going into an asset and disrupting current income, it can be quite dilutive in some cases. So you have to measure and understand that as well and then counterbalance it with the kind of returns and opportunities that you would get by putting, basically, whether it's some additional size into an existing property through a single, larger building or a multitude of, again, new Gen 5 properties or in some cases actually tearing down the entire site.

So there's no question that we spent more in 2019 than we did in 2018. So your point around comps as we get into 2020 is a fair one. We don't manage our advertising spend based on what we spent last year. We manage it based on what it is we're getting for it and what the return is on it in the current period. And so if we like what we're seeing, we're going to spend even more in 2020. We won't hesitate to do that if we like the returns. And the flip side is, we're managing it dynamically. So there will be markets where we've toned down advertising spend and ones where we likely increase as we get into 2020. The one thing I highlighted on the last call was just stepping back and thinking about advertising spend as a percentage of revenue and the fact that it was 3-plus percent historically in previous cycles and it got as low as about 1% of revenue in 2015, 2016 when, frankly, we were full and didn't need to spend on marketing. We've been increasing it consistently over the past several years and would anticipate that we increase it in 2020 as well.

We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are in essential business. The need for self-storage even in disruptive times like these is yet, again, being validated. 
In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares fund, which provides child care coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can't overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been, and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers. 
As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle-tested, our product is resilient and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to, not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full public storage team is well equipped to, not only face what are challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. 
Now I will hand the call over to the operator for questions."

We've all been through a number of economic cycles of different degrees, as I mentioned. We, in particular, from time to time go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it's health- and science-related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well, and in even the Great Recession. We were pleasantly surprised by, again, the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month -- or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now again, that's down. But on the flip side, there's vibrancy there. There's need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties. We can now track holistically because we have a centralized access system. So again, whether it's at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service-oriented from a business that may or may not [ seize ] facility, even the type of activity that's going on with this COVID economy, there is a true and, I think, valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution because, frankly, we just don't know what's going to play through. And I don't know how realistic you can predict anything because we're 6 weeks into this, and there's just going to be a number of things as we're discovering day-to-day, week-to-week, that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven't seen before. 
Now again, other things, though, are somewhat similar so far to what we've seen with extreme economic cycles. So in the Great Recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint was consistent even on a year-over-year basis. So it's a mixture. And it's just something that we're going to, again, continue to react to. We've got great tools to be nimble. We've got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So that would basically be an overview of how, again, we're looking at this environment and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown."

It's very early, but it won't be surprising if, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last 3 or 4 years, where we've seen an abundance of new supply come into the market, particularly with owner owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable effect, which would be more ability to capture assets, again a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it's been over the last, say, 3 or 4 years. We're starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they've been funded through a certain level of debt and the valuations are below that value. And so we're starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. Again, it's early, but it wouldn't be surprising to us. And the ability for us to, in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity.

It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%,",604,"Sure, Jeremy. I'll walk through a number of those points. It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students and others ahead of stay-at-home owners. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20%, to give you a context. But then that volume started to decline significantly as folks were encouraged to stay home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall, move in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. So for those customers that have a storage need, we're providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease, somewhat encouraging. As Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year's seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. 
Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So the last week of April, for instance, move in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So move-out volumes, not take into account auction related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We're watching this metric closely. Anticipate that as stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in penta move out volume. We've talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down. As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of properties, so not just move-ins and move-outs, which is customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what's going on at the properties. And April activity was down about 20% versus March. 
In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We've continued to do that through the month of April. So our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy would be down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year. And that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We've collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to to where we go from here, it could very likely put more pressure on the consumer, and we'll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line."

I think the the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted, and we've seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast. Also slow rates of move-outs, but slow rates have move-ins. And so as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because I would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior year, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the Northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what's going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely, we have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted."

Stepping back, existing tenant rate increases in a more normal time are managed at a very granular level using data analytics to drive what we send, when we send it and the magnitude. That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different post this event than what it was before.

So to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008, in the first quarter of 2009. The magnitude of those were in the mid-single digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we're seeing in the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture given the pandemic, it's a different reaction given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay at home, and we're all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So I think it's hard to point back at that and say it's a perfect analog, to be honest. But it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
I think one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss as it relates to move-outs, but it's also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don't want to come visit our properties to move out right now because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So we'll see where we go from here, but your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to date and, in fact, the move-ins -- move-outs are down."

And certainly, we're reacting to different signals that are coming in this year than what we saw last year. Your point on seasonality, we've already seen an impact to the seasonality to date, which is the college students that with colleges going to e-learning, and shutting down physical presence in the month of March, we saw that activity pull forward. As we move into the month of May and June, you'd have other seasonal use cases that would come up, whether we see those this year, I think, is to be determined and may very well differ materially by region and jurisdiction given how things are managed would stay-at-home orders this year.

So again, because of the unpredictability going into the second half of this year, and frankly, even for the rest of this quarter. I mean, we'll see how things go. I'll tell you, though, that the variety of wage rates we have nationally is something that we constantly do evaluate. We look at, again, the relative pay for the scope and the applicability of skill for the type of compensation that we have, and we think we're aligned in that regard. And again, that's just something that will continue to be fluid. Clearly, one of the things that we have the ability to do, and we clearly thought it was the right thing to do was to, again, give additional support to our frontline workers, in particular. They're, as I mentioned in my opening comments, a critical part of our overall operational strategies and taking care of customers, et cetera.

We've tapered that down, knowing that we're going to be looking at delays from an approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months based on what we're seeing at the moment as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets approvals that come through when you're doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we're going to go into a much more beneficial arena even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow program is aligned with. So that was one component. 
A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness. But even from a cost standpoint, we think we're going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year, and it ties to things that we will continue to do, as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate a high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that vendor friction aside that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We're putting solar on a number of properties. So that's really what's led to the reset on our expectation for 2020."

And I think you can make sense of that really more from a health standpoint and a science standpoint because that's frankly where the most dramatic impact to the COVID virus has been so far. And again, many of those communities are in major lockdowns. So we'll see. And we play in both arenas very actively, continually as we speak.

You talked about same-store NOI being negative for the rest of the year, given the pressures on revenues and certainly, the investments you're making in your employee base and to keep your facility safe and clean, and so about the revenue and expense impact. If you look to the last 2 recessions that we've gone through, in the early 2000s, same-store NOI across the self-storage sector was down high single-digit year-over-year on a quarterly basis. If you go back to the '09, '10 time frame, it was down 4% to 6% on a quarterly year-over-year basis. How should we -- what type of goalposts should investors think about in terms of the rate of decline? I think you talked about it will be a much quicker impact to your business than the prior recessions, just given all these stay-at-home orders and a complete halt in the economy. Should we be gearing up for a high single digit, maybe even a double-digit decline given the expense drag? Is that where our mind should be at by the end of the year?"

We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are in essential business. The need for self-storage, even in disruptive times like these, is yet, again, being validated. 
In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. 
At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can't overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been, and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers. 
As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle-tested, our product is resilient and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face what are challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. 
Now I will hand the call over to the operator for questions."

We've all been through a number of economic cycles of different degrees, as I mentioned. We, in particular, from time to time go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it's health- and science-related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well, and in even the great recession, we were pleasantly surprised by, again, the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month -- or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now again, that's down. But on the flip side, there's vibrancy there. There's need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically because we have a centralized access system. So again, whether it's at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service-oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that's going on with this COVID economy, there is a true and, I think, valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution because, frankly, we just don't know what's going to play through. And I don't know how realistic you can predict anything because we're 6 weeks into this, and there's just going to be a number of things as we're discovering day-to-day, week-to-week, that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven't seen before. 
Now again, other things, though, are somewhat similar so far to what we've seen with extreme economic cycles. So in the Great Recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint was consistent even on a year-over-year basis. So it's a mixture. And it's just something that we're going to, again, continue to react to. We've got great tools to be nimble. We've got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So that would basically be an overview of how, again, we're looking at this environment and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown."

It's very early, but it won't be surprising if, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last 3 or 4 years, where we've seen an abundance of new supply come into the market, particularly with owner -- owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable effect, which would be more ability to capture assets, again a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it's been over the last, say, 3 or 4 years. We're starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they've been funded through a certain level of debt and the valuations are below that value. And so we're starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. Again, it's early, but it wouldn't be surprising to us. And the ability for us to, in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity. The balance sheet's ready for it, and it's ready in a meaningful way. So we'll see how that plays through. And I'll hand it over to Tom. He can give you a little bit more color on where the balance sheet stands today."

It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%,",601,"Sure, Jeremy. I'll walk through a number of those points. It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students and others ahead of stay-at-home owners. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20%, to give you a context. But then that volume started to decline significantly as folks were encouraged to stay home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall, move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. 
So for those customers that have a storage need, we're providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease, somewhat encouraging. As Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year's seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. 
Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So the last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So move-out volumes, not take into account auction related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We're watching this metric closely, and anticipate that as stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We've talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down. 
As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of properties, so not just move-ins and move-outs, which is customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what's going on at the properties. And April activity was down about 20% versus March. 
In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We've continued to do that through the month of April. So our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy would be down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year. And that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We've collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, it could very likely put more pressure on the consumer, and we'll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line."

I think the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted, and we've seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast. Also slow rates of move-outs, but slow rates of move-ins. And so as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because I would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior year, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the Northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what's going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely. We have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted."

So to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008, in the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we're seeing in the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture given the pandemic, it's a different reaction given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay at home, and we're all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So I think it's hard to point back at that and say it's a perfect analogue, to be honest. But it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
I think one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss as it relates to move-outs, but it's also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don't want to come visit our properties to move out right now because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So we'll see where we go from here, but your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to date and, in fact, move-ins -- move-outs are down."

All told, for us directly is about 10,000 units. And lease-up there is going well on the new properties. We're not seeing a like-for-like additional magnitude of new development going into the market, but there's some. But we felt it was relevant to call it out because, again, our same store is not progressing as well as some other markets have been in the near term, but we feel like the stabilization that will take place over the next 1 to 2 years as, again, we see good absorption of the new product.

And we have reset that to about $175 million. So there's some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One, is a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019 carried into this year, along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We've tapered that down, knowing that we're going to be looking at delays from an approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months based on what we're seeing at the moment as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you're doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we're going to go into a much more beneficial arena even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow program is aligned with. So that was one component. 
A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness, but even from a cost standpoint, we think we're going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year, and it ties to things that we will continue to do, as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate a high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that -- vendor friction aside, that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We're putting solar on a number of properties. So that's really what's led to the reset on our expectation for 2020."

You talked about same-store NOI being negative for the rest of the year, given the pressures on revenues and certainly, the investments you're making in your employee base and to keep your facility safe and clean, and so about the revenue and expense impact. If you look to the last 2 recessions that we've gone through, in the early 2000s, same-store NOI across the self-storage sector was down high single digit year-over-year on a quarterly basis. If you go back to the '09, '10 time frame, it was down 4% to 6% on a quarterly year-over-year basis. How should we -- what type of goalposts should investors think about in terms of the rate of decline? I think you talked about it will be a much quicker impact to your business than the prior recessions, just given all these stay-at-home orders and a complete halt in the economy. Should we be gearing up for a high single digit, maybe even a double-digit decline given the expense drag? Is that where our mind should be at by the end of the year?"

We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are in essential business. The need for self-storage, even in disruptive times like these, is yet, again, being validated.
In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. 
At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can't overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been, and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers.
As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle-tested, our product is resilient and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face what are challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. 
Now I will hand the call over to the operator for questions."

We've all been through a number of economic cycles of different degrees, as I mentioned. We, in particular, from time to time go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it's health- and science-related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well, and in even the great recession, we were pleasantly surprised by, again, the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month -- or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now again, that's down. But on the flip side, there's vibrancy there. There's need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically because we have a centralized access system. So again, whether it's at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service-oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that's going on with this COVID economy, there is a true and, I think, valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution because, frankly, we just don't know what's going to play through. And I don't know how realistic you can predict anything because we're 6 weeks into this, and there's just going to be a number of things as we're discovering day-to-day, week-to-week, that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven't seen before. 
Now again, other things, though, are somewhat similar so far to what we've seen with extreme economic cycles. So in the Great Recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint was consistent even on a year-over-year basis. So it's a mixture. And it's just something that we're going to, again, continue to react to. We've got great tools to be nimble. We've got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So that would basically be an overview of how, again, we're looking at this environment and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown."

There could be, again, a predictable effect, which would be more ability to capture assets, again a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it's been over the last, say, 3 or 4 years. We're starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they've been funded through a certain level of debt and the valuations are below that value. And so we're starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. Again, it's early, but it wouldn't be surprising to us.

It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%,",601,"Sure, Jeremy. I'll walk through a number of those points. It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students and others ahead of stay-at-home owners. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20%, to give you a context. But then that volume started to decline significantly as folks were encouraged to stay home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall, move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. 
So for those customers that have a storage need, we're providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease, somewhat encouraging. As Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year's seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. 
Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So the last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So move-out volumes, not taken into account. Auction related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We're watching this metric closely, and anticipate that as stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We've talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down.
As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of properties, so not just move-ins and move-outs, which is customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what's going on at the properties. And April activity was down about 20% versus March. 
In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We've continued to do that through the month of April. So our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy would be down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year. And that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We've collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, it could very likely put more pressure on the consumer, and we'll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line."

I think the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted, and we've seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast. Also slow rates of move-outs, but slow rates of move-ins. And so as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because I would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior year, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the Northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what's going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely. We have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted."

That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different post this event than what it was before.

So to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008, in the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we're seeing in the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture given the pandemic, it's a different reaction given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay at home, and we're all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So I think it's hard to point back at that and say it's a perfect analogue, to be honest. But it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
I think one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss as it relates to move-outs, but it's also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don't want to come visit our properties to move out right now because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So we'll see where we go from here, but your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to date and, in fact, move-ins -- move-outs are down."

So one of the things that we did was provide some incremental customer accommodation for those impacted by the pandemic. And I would highlight that our operational teams have dealt with crisis situations over the past several years and are well equipped to deal with situations that materially impact local communities. And so while that's historically happened in very tight geographies, in this case, it really happened across the country. But our operational team pivoted to that stance very quickly and effectively. And so we are waiving fees, reducing rent in some instances and working with delinquent customers across the country for those impacted by the COVID pandemic. We already talked about the fact that we've paused auctions and existing tenant rate increases as well. But I've been really impressed by our operations team's ability to move into crisis mode and to help those that have been impacted to date. And that is a driver of some of the fees that you highlight and would expect that to be the case as we move through the second quarter as well."

So over the last 2 years, we've boosted that by doing 3 things: We've added to our own portfolio through acquisitions, ground-up development and redevelopment in a market that we hadn't actually had a lot of investment activity for some time. We like and see, I think, very good long-term traction relative to the market itself and the additional inventory and new properties that we put into that market. All told, for us directly is about 10,000 units. And lease-up there is going well on the new properties. We're not seeing a like-for-like additional magnitude of new development going into the market, but there's some. But we felt it was relevant to call it out because, again, our same store is not progressing as well as some other markets have been in the near term, but we feel like the stabilization that will take place over the next 1 to 2 years as, again, we see good absorption of the new product. And any of the things that are happening in our existing properties, correct as well. So again, the markets, I think, well placed for future growth.

And we have reset that to about $175 million. So there's some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One, is a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019, carried into this year, along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We've tapered that down, knowing that we're going to be looking at delays from an approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months based on what we're seeing at the moment as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you're doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we're going to go into a much more beneficial arena even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow program is aligned with. So that was one component. A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness, but even from a cost standpoint, we think we're going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. 
On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year, and it ties to things that we will continue to do, as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate a high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that -- vendor friction aside, that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We're putting solar on a number of properties. So that's really what's led to the reset on our expectation for 2020."

We'll continue to assess it. I couldn't, at this point, guide you to, okay, where is it stack rank? Or how are we benchmarking it against our uses of capital at the moment? The thing that's on the horizon likely, though, that we've already talked to is with the potential impact to a number of owners that have put anywhere from, say, 1,500 to 2,000 properties collectively into our sector over the last 3 or 4 years. A lot of those investments are not going to come close to the pro forma expectations or underwriting hurdles that they had put forth. So we would anticipate, but we'll see that like other big corrections that this too will lead to an opportunity for us to allocate capital in that direction, but to be determined. So we've got a variety of different capital allocation options, and we'll continue to assess them as this thing plays through."

We wish the best for all of you listening in today, particularly those that have been personally impacted by the pandemic. I want to begin by thanking our employees, customers and business partners for their extraordinary efforts and flexibility as we adapt to this environment. Our focus is simple. Safety is the top priority in everything we do, protecting our employees and customers. We are operating our entire 2,500-plus portfolio in all markets as we are in essential business. The need for self-storage, even in disruptive times like these, is yet, again, being validated.
In that regard, our priorities beyond safety includes servicing new and existing customers as our communities navigate through these challenging times. To do so, we are supporting our frontline employees in several ways to optimize customer service. Protocols are in place that reinforce social distancing, keeping properties clean and offering customers multiple avenues to rent or access their space in a contactless way. 
At the start of the pandemic, we also established the PS Cares Fund, which provides childcare coverage, extended pay time off and additional hourly compensation to our entire team of property managers. I can't overstate how valuable their commitment to Public Storage has been, and will continue to be as they serve our 1.5 million customers.
As Public Storage approaches its 50th year, we have clearly weathered significant economic cycles, and this one will likely rank as one of the most extreme. We have a proven playbook to maneuver through severe economic and natural disasters. Our teams are battle-tested, our product is resilient and we have intentionally crafted a fortress balance sheet to not only survive, but thrive in times like these. At its core, the full Public Storage team is well equipped to not only face what are challenges arise in the near term, but confidently, we will find new ways of applying our unique strength and fortitude to find opportunities. 
Now I will hand the call over to the operator for questions."

We've all been through a number of economic cycles of different degrees, as I mentioned. We, in particular, from time to time go through what we call natural disasters, hurricanes and otherwise. This is clearly even different than those because it's health- and science-related. The predictability of this environment is to be determined at best with a lot of information none of us have dealt with before. When we do look back at prior cycles, again, our product type has played through very well, and in even the great recession, we were pleasantly surprised by, again, the resiliency and the adaptability and relevance of the property type itself. On one hand, we clearly know that there continues to be a high degree of need and usage of the product. This month -- or last month, April, we moved in 82,000 customers into our portfolio. Now again, that's down. But on the flip side, there's vibrancy there. There's need. We see it also with the amount of activity at our properties that we can now track holistically because we have a centralized access system. So again, whether it's at a raw consumer level and/or anything that tiers into service-oriented from a business that may or may not be facility, even the type of activity that's going on with this COVID economy, there is a true and, I think, valid need for the product itself. So we are looking at the future with a fair degree of caution because, frankly, we just don't know what's going to play through. And I don't know how realistic you can predict anything because we're 6 weeks into this, and there's just going to be a number of things as we're discovering day-to-day, week-to-week, that this environment will create even additional types of pressure points that we haven't seen before. 
Now again, other things, though, are somewhat similar so far to what we've seen with extreme economic cycles. So in the Great Recession, our delinquency hovered around, again, a 2% factor or so through the month of April, very similar. So our customer base, even through the month of April, from a collection and payment standpoint was consistent even on a year-over-year basis. So it's a mixture. And it's just something that we're going to, again, continue to react to. We've got great tools to be nimble. We've got great analytics to continue to address, again, whatever continues to surface or does surface that we need to address and address through different tactics, strategies, et cetera. So that would basically be an overview of how, again, we're looking at this environment and clearly in a position that the predictability of it is still unknown."

It's very early, but it won't be surprising if, again, a number of owners that have come into the sector, particularly over the last 3 or 4 years, where we've seen an abundance of new supply come into the market, particularly with owner -- owners and ownership structures that may not be well suited to deal with something like this. There could be, again, a predictable effect, which would be more ability to capture assets, again a price point that we think is very different and much more attractive than it's been over the last, say, 3 or 4 years. We're starting to hear, again, some rumblings around assets that I would say are underwater, where they've been funded through a certain level of debt and the valuations are below that value. And so we're starting, again, to hear some of that out in the market. Again, it's early, but it wouldn't be surprising to us. And the ability for us to, in particular, take advantage of an environment that could create that additional level of transaction activity. The balance sheet's ready for it, and it's ready in a meaningful way. So we'll see how that plays through. And I'll hand it over to Tom.

It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%,",601,"Sure, Jeremy. I'll walk through a number of those points. It's Tom. So stepping back, looking at activity through the quarter and then into April, we had a pretty good quarter on move-ins, which really began in January, February, we were up, call it, 5%, 10% on move-ins in January. In March, we saw a meaningful increase in demand as customers pulled forward activity that would typically occur later in the second quarter, most notably college students and others ahead of stay-at-home owners. One week in March, for instance, move-ins were up about 20%, to give you a context. But then that volume started to decline significantly as folks were encouraged to stay home. Overall search volumes have come down. Inbound sales calls are down about 25% in April. Web visits are down about 7% in April. Overall, move-in activity through the month of April was down 17%, despite decreases in rental rates of circa 20% to drive volume across the country. 
So for those customers that have a storage need, we're providing space with enhanced precautions in our properties and utilizing our e-rental online lease, somewhat encouraging. As Joe mentioned, over 80% of last year's seasonal activity we experienced in April, which speaks to demand for the product even in tough times. 
Trends modestly improved as we moved through April. So the last week of April, for instance, move-in volumes were down about 11%. But again, it reduced rental rates. Somewhat offsetting the decline in move-ins was an anticipated decline in move-outs. So move-out volumes, not taken into account. Auction related move-outs was down 9% in the month of April. We're watching this metric closely, and anticipate that as stay-at-home orders are lifted, we may see an increase in pent-up move-out volume. We've talked about in the past that in 2009, there was a shift in consumer behavior with longer length of stay customers moving out. We have not seen that to date. Our existing tenants continue to perform well and move-outs remain down.
As Joe mentioned, we have seen less overall activity of properties, so not just move-ins and move-outs, which is customer visits to the property. Our new centralized access system gives us insights into what's going on at the properties. And April activity was down about 20% versus March. 
In terms of occupancy, we ended the first quarter up about 60, 70 basis points in occupancy. As we disclosed, part of that was attributable to the fact that we had postponed auctions of delinquent customers. We've continued to do that through the month of April. So our occupancy at the end of April was up about 30 basis points. But if you take into account the fact that we have some customers with us that we may have otherwise auctioned in prior years, our occupancy would be down on a year-over-year basis. Still up seasonally on an absolute basis, but down on a year-over-year basis. 
Moving to collections, which is the third prong of your commentary. As noted in press release and as Joe just highlighted, April rent collections were very consistent with prior year. And that is consistent with what we saw in 2009. We've collected about 95% of our April rent at this point, which is right in line with where we were last year at this time. So as the duration of this pandemic elongates and we react to where we go from here, it could very likely put more pressure on the consumer, and we'll have to monitor that as we go forward. But at this point, collections are very much in line."

I think the high level takeaway is that the Northeast has been more impacted, and we've seen slower rates of move-ins in the Northeast. Also slow rates of move-outs, but slow rates of move-ins. And so as you look at New York or Boston or Philadelphia, and really, you can expand that up and down the East Coast because I would put Miami probably in that category as well. Along the West Coast, move-in volumes have been more similar with prior year, still down, but down more in the 5% to 10% range in many of those markets versus higher in the Northeast. And then that extends through the Southwest and into Texas. Houston is a market that certainly with the combination of the pandemic as well as with what's going on with oil prices, one that we and we suspect others are watching closely. We have seen move-in volumes hold up reasonably well in Houston but we have cut rate in order to drive that volume more meaningfully in Houston than we have in other markets in Texas and the West Coast that I highlighted."

That will be an important part of where we go from here and how we restart at the appropriate time, recognizing that consumer behavior could be a little bit different post this event than what it was before.

Todd, I think looking back at 2009 as a guide, as I look at move-in, move-out trends in 2009, they were more gradual as they came on than what we've seen to date. So to give you a context, we did see a material increase in move-outs. But as you look at the quarters in which they took place in the fourth quarter of 2008, in the first quarter of 2009, the magnitude of those were in the mid-single digits, which as you compare that to the orders of magnitude that we're seeing in the sharp decrease in move-ins and move-outs already at this juncture given the pandemic, it's a different reaction given the fact that folks are being encouraged to stay at home, and we're all kind of awaiting scientific research and developments. So I think it's hard to point back at that and say it's a perfect analogue, to be honest. But it did happen with increased move-outs pretty quickly on the back of declines in employment in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
I think one of the biggest drivers now is not just job loss as it relates to move-outs, but it's also the fact that there are customers who are staying at home and maybe don't want to come visit our properties to move out right now because they feel good about the safety and security of their goods at our properties. So we'll see where we go from here, but your point that you made is the right one, which is we have not seen any noticeable shift to date and, in fact, move-ins -- move-outs are down."

As we move into the month of May and June, you'd have other seasonal use cases that would come up, whether we see those this year, I think, is to be determined and may very well differ materially by region and jurisdiction given how things are managed with stay-at-home orders this year.

I'll tell you, though, that the variety of wage rates we have nationally is something that we constantly do evaluate. We look at, again, the relative pay for the scope and the applicability of skill for the type of compensation that we have, and we think we're aligned in that regard. And again, that's just something that will continue to be fluid. Clearly, one of the things that we have the ability to do, and we clearly thought it was the right thing to do was to, again, give additional support to our frontline workers, in particular.

And we have reset that to about $175 million. So there's some things in the mix there that have led to the reduction. One, is a number of the capital projects that we launched into 2019, carried into this year, along with some of our strategic investments around what we call our Property of Tomorrow initiative. We've tapered that down, knowing that we're going to be looking at delays from an approval and/or permitting basis in one regard through the next few months based on what we're seeing at the moment as cities have shut down many of their own staffing levels and/or sets of approvals that come through when you're doing work along those lines, coupled with the fact that we think we're going to go into a much more beneficial arena even for bidding and continuing from a scale standpoint, the transition of properties to our Gen 5 standard that the Property of Tomorrow program is aligned with. So that was one component. A number of other things that also we were intending to do through this year, not in any way related to functionality of properties or anything else, but it just makes sense based on availability and predictability of not only vendor effectiveness, but even from a cost standpoint, we think we're going to be much better suited to do more of that going into 2021. 
On the flip side of that, we still are anticipating about $175 million that will happen this year, and it ties to things that we will continue to do, as we always do, keeping our properties highly functional, doing repairs, doing everything that we can to facilitate a high degree of customer move-ins and high occupancy. We also still are doing a few things that -- vendor friction aside, that we think we can still do in this environment that would also relate to upgrades to LED and energy efficiency. We're putting solar on a number of properties. So that's really what's led to the reset on our expectation for 2020."

Meaningful other than Tom mentioned that we have seen a little bit more of an impact in the Northeast. And I think you can make sense of that really more from a health standpoint and a science standpoint because that's frankly where the most dramatic impact to the COVID virus has been so far. And again, many of those communities are in major lockdowns. So we'll see. And we play in both arenas very actively, continually as we speak.

You talked about same-store NOI being negative for the rest of the year, given the pressures on revenues and certainly, the investments you're making in your employee base and to keep your facility safe and clean, and so about the revenue and expense impact. If you look to the last 2 recessions that we've gone through, in the early 2000s, same-store NOI across the self-storage sector was down high single digit year-over-year on a quarterly basis. If you go back to the '09, '10 time frame, it was down 4% to 6% on a quarterly year-over-year basis. How should we -- what type of goalposts should investors think about in terms of the rate of decline? I think you talked about it will be a much quicker impact to your business than the prior recessions, just given all these stay-at-home orders and a complete halt in the economy. Should we be gearing up for a high single digit, maybe even a double-digit decline given the expense drag? Is that where our mind should be at by the end of the year?"

Yes, there's no question, as I noted, that we've been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we've been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with, obviously, a number of crosscurrents. So if you step back and think about the last 4 months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through 4 different phases. And the early part of the pandemic March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols. We suspended options and really make sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So we saw a bit of a rush, but then not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We, again, suspended options, and we opened up to a degree, some of the customer accommodation practices, again, to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top-of-funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So we started to see the residual benefit of that. And again, a lift in demand and move in volume. The next phase, again, we continue along those same lines, but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month-after-month, seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move-outs. And then finally, the most recent phase, as we stand through the month of July, we've actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we're starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of lower move-outs. So speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I'll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we've been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand. And literally, we are dealing with, in many markets, record high levels of occupancy.
Tom, why don't you give a little bit more color on the second half of the year?"

So as Joe mentioned, operating metrics really started to improve as we move through the second quarter and have continued that post quarter we can spend more time there, if you like. But I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics. And while operating metrics improved throughout the second quarter. Financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same-store pool deteriorate. So if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components, same store occupancy was up about 20 basis points. Same store rents were down 2%. So that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same-store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for 2 primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers requesting fee relief. And so we did grant the vast majority of those requests. But collections, frankly, were quite good through the quarter. And so as we move through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that's likely to continue, or at least we've seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So clearly, we're starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position, and we're still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections."

Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions pause for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We've begun to work through that during the quarter. And so right now, we're sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable as we ended the quarter was actually down a little bit year-over-year. Stepping back, it's obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, running spaces and collecting rent. And I think we saw good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them, and we saw good payment activity and rental activity. I think there's also broader things that work. There's no question that governments stimulus or government support for many individuals throughout the economy. We suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individual's finances."

Investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had again, in the March and April time frame, a handful of assets that have been already vetted. We still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals towards the earlier part of the quarter. And then as things settle down, we actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates, pre-pandemic would be stabilized assets. There's still a lot of capital on the sidelines that's out looking for those types of investments. What we've done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints they may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I'll tell you that. And with that, we've got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we've got a few assets that are in motion, and we're confident that we'll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing maybe no surprise a few more land holding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions in land, maybe have taken them through various stages entitlement that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what's going on with rates across most markets are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities, and we'll see how this continues to play forth in the coming quarters."

The magnitude of them compared to prior years, though, is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1 to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place."

So the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So you'll see some moderation down in the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter.

The largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increases. The rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed are move-in and move-out trend throughout the second quarter, which was also here clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter."

So the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged and move-in. And so that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you've seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you're going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lean and lean sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So if a customer doesn't pay the rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That's where we saw improving collection trends reduce the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that, that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July, but the composition of the driver changed as we move through the quarter. In the month of April and the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers' request. Some sort of customer accommodation or either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief, and the majority of that was granted. As we move through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished, and collection trends improved such that by the time we got into June, that down 30% and fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends, and that's continued through July. In terms of how much into the future, we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It's hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. I don't think I would have sat here and told you that. But now having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends even as we get into August here, it does feel like it's part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there's no question there's bigger factors there at work. And so it's certainly a potential driver of lower same store revenues in the second half because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter."

We are doing actions again. We do have a few municipalities where we're being held back, but our auction overhang is actually quite limited. It accounts for only about 20 basis points of our overall occupancy. So that too talks to the way that we continue to be optimized around our entire collection process, our customer engagement process, and we've been able to calibrate that very efficiently even in an environment where there's been a number of hurdles that had limited us, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic to do options, and we are basically back in the auction business in many parts of the portfolio. We're certainly abiding by areas where we're unable to do options, but the meaningful chunk of that part of our business has returned."

We ended the quarter up 50 basis points. And again, that age delinquency really represented about 20 basis points there. So call it up 30 basis points on a net basis. That's really continued to improve. And at July 31, our occupancy was up 140 basis points. And again, about 20 basis points of impact of delayed auction activity. So net up about a 120 basis points in occupancy, and that's really related to the operating trends that Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases and improving trends in move-ins and continued lower move-outs coupled with the fact that our delinquency process was underway, allowed us to rerent that space and move occupancy higher as we move through July."

We look at density, from a population standpoint, how our properties are performing. You mentioned New York. Ironically, at the moment, New York has actually been a huge beneficiary of the amount of demand that we've seen over the last quarter or so. San Francisco is the same. But again, we are not stepping back in basically putting any kind of a label on suburban versus urban. It's way too soon to tell. We have good diversification across all of our markets, I guess, whether they're in suburban or urban markets, and we will continue to track and see the lingering impact from the pandemic. And again, just a shift in overall patterns about where people choose to live, it's way too soon to tell. One thing that has been pronounced that we see from a demand standpoint in both markets is the work-from-home impact. We see many more of our customers coming to us because they are not going to a traditional office. They need more space at home. And by virtue of that, they're putting more stuff in our facilities. So that's been a meaningful additional demand factor that we've seen both in urban and suburban markets."

We have a fair amount of both new development acquisition opportunities for customers to move-in, and we've seen an inordinate amount of move-in activity, which has been quite a good surprise or a good benefit based on a number of things we're seeing from a trend standpoint. So I mentioned that we've moved in about 400,000 customers in the last 4 months. If you just look at Q2 of the 300,000 or so customers have moved in, 60,000 of those move-ins came into our non same store portfolio. The non same-store portfolio continues to do quite well from an occupancy growth standpoint, and we're up about 11%. And continue to see very good trends and tractions relative to both new builds, redevelopment and acquisitions that we've added into the portfolio that total pulled about 13.5 million square feet, and we continue to see very good performance and fill ups across all markets. Frankly, we haven't seen any of our acquisitions development going backwards in this environment, they have done the absolute opposite where they're filling up pretty dramatically."

Last quarter, we talked about the likelihood that it would be anywhere, say, 15% to 20% or so less than what was predicted, which would 0.2%, plus or minus have $5 billion or so level of deliveries in 2020. We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway, relative to those deliveries taking place, although some of them are taking longer, no surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections, again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into the level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based, again, on what I mentioned earlier, there will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition -- or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be, but it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been hit heavy with new supply. So too soon to tell yet the lingering impact into '21 and beyond, but we're likely to see, again, another leg down."

I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry, but I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better cash trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to the conducting auctions that's reduced the amount of backlog. So a combination of conducting lean sales as well as better collections, leading to about 20 basis points age delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways as I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we help the customers that we're having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country, folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight that collections were good. Through the second quarter, I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies they would likely say something similar. So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward. And that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. I think to maybe one more stat as we just throw stats around on this particular topic, I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier, and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it, and we're working with them and obviously, working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well."

So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing accelerated lease-up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because, again, we're even seeing that acceleration right now. We're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which it takes up to that 3 to 4 years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same-store.

Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the health care impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict. No question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1% is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that -- right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases, but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough health care environment. And so I think it's hard to project going forward right now, magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move-in and move-out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move-outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move-outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the health care situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think, will likely impact our move-in and move-out trends as well. So I know that's a long-winded way of saying I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move in place rents."

If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the health care environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move-ins and move-outs has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our submarkets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends, and it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go. We are still dealing with a lot of the headwinds that we spoke about earlier in the year."

Yes, there's no question, as I noted, that we've been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we've been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with, obviously, a number of crosscurrents. So if you step back and think about the last 4 months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through 4 different phases. And the early part of the pandemic March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols. We suspended auctions and really make sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So we saw a bit of a rush, but then not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We, again, suspended auctions, and we opened up to a degree, some of the customer accommodation practices, again, to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top-of-funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So we started to see the residual benefit of that. And again, a lift in demand and move-in volume. The next phase, again, we continue along those same lines, but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month-after-month, seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move-outs. And then finally, the most recent phase, as we stand through the month of July, we've actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we're starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of -- or the lower move-outs. So speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I'll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we've been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand. And literally, we are dealing with, in many markets, record high levels of occupancy.
Tom, why don't you give a little bit more color on the second half of the year?"

So as Joe mentioned, operating metrics really started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post quarter we can spend more time there, if you like. But I think part of your question was around the discussion around same store revenue trends. So how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics. And while operating metrics improved throughout the second quarter. Financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components. Same store occupancy was up about 20 basis points. Same store rents were down 2%. So that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for 2 primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers requesting fee relief. And so we did grant the vast majority of those requests. But collections, frankly, were quite good through the quarter. And so as we move through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that's likely to continue, or at least we've seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So clearly, we're starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position, and we're still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections."

Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions pause for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We've begun to work through that during the quarter. And so right now, we're sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable as we ended the quarter was actually down a little bit year-over-year. Stepping back, it's obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, running spaces and collecting rent. And I think we saw good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them, and we saw good payment activity and rental activity. I think there's also broader things that work. There's no question that governments stimulus -- government support for many individuals throughout the economy we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individual's finances."

There's no question at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had again, in the March and April time frame, a handful of assets that have been already vetted. We still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals towards the earlier part of the quarter. And then as things settle down, we actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates pre-pandemic would be stabilized assets. There's still a lot of capital on the sidelines that's out looking for those types of investments. What we've done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints they may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I'll tell you that. And with that, we've got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we've got a few assets that are in motion, and we're confident that we'll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing maybe no surprise a few more land holding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions in land, maybe have taken them through various stages entitlement that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what's going on with rates across most markets are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities, and we'll see how this continues to play forth in the coming quarters."

In terms of the breadth of it across the country, those increases are broadly spread throughout the country. So in the vast majority of the country, we're able to send existing tenant rate increases. The magnitude of them compared to prior years, though, is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1 to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place."

So the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So you'll see some moderation down in the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter. And then we'll also, as you see, be looking at lower taxes potentially because we saw property taxes come in lower at about 3.6% in the second quarter.

The largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increases.

So the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged and move-in. And so that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you've seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you're going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lean and lean sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So if a customer doesn't pay the rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That's where we saw improving collection trends reduce the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that, that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July, but the composition of the driver changed as we move through the quarter. In the month of April and the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers' request. Some sort of customer accommodation or either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief, and the majority of that was granted. As we move through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished, and collection trends improved such that by the time we got into June, that down 30% and fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends, and that's continued through July. In terms of how much into the future, we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It's hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. I don't think I would have sat here and told you that. But now having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends even as we get into August here, it does feel like it's part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there's no question there's bigger factors there at work. And so it's certainly a potential driver of lower same store revenues in the second half because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter."

And again, just a shift in overall patterns about where people choose to live, it's way too soon to tell. One thing that has been pronounced that we see from a demand standpoint in both markets is the work-from-home impact. We see many more of our customers coming to us because they are not going to a traditional office. They need more space at home. And by virtue of that, they're putting more stuff in our facilities.

We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway, relative to those deliveries taking place, although some of them are taking longer, no surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections, again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into the level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based, again, on what I mentioned earlier, there will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition -- or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be, but it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been hit heavy with new supply.

I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry, but I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better cash trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to the conducting auctions that's reduced the amount of backlog. So a combination of conducting lean sales as well as better collections, leading to about 20 basis points age delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways as I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we help the customers that we're having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country, folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight that collections were good. Through the second quarter, I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies they would likely say something similar. So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward. And that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. I think to maybe one more stat as we just throw stats around on this particular topic, I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier, and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%.

It's typical for a property to take 3 or 4 years to go through not only occupancy lease-up at the level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing accelerated lease-up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because, again, we're even seeing that acceleration right now. We're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which it takes up to that 3 to 4 years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store. And again, look at the stability that typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the time frame for stabilization."

Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the health care impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict. No question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1% is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that -- right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases, but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough health care environment. And so I think it's hard to project going forward right now, magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move-in and move-out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move-outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move-outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the health care situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think, will likely impact our move-in and move-out trends as well. So I know that's a long-winded way of saying I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move-in place rents."

I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the health care environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move-ins and move-outs has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our submarkets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends, and it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go.

Yes, there's no question, as I noted, that we've been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we've been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with, obviously, a number of crosscurrents. So if you step back and think about the last 4 months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through 4 different phases. And the early part of the pandemic March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols. We suspended auctions and really make sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So we saw a bit of a rush, but then not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We, again, suspended auctions, and we opened up to a degree, some of the customer accommodation practices, again, to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top-of-funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So we started to see the residual benefit of that. And again, a lift in demand and move-in volume. The next phase, again, we continue along those same lines, but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month-after-month, seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move-outs. And then finally, the most recent phase, as we stand through the month of July, we've actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we're starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of -- or the lower move-outs. So speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I'll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we've been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand. And literally, we are dealing with, in many markets, record-high levels of occupancy.
Tom, why don't you give a little bit more color on the second half of the year?"

So as Joe mentioned, operating metrics really started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post quarter we can spend more time there, if you like. But I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics. And while operating metrics improved throughout the second quarter. Financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components. Same-store occupancy was up about 20 basis points. Same-store rents were down 2%. So that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for 2 primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers requesting fee relief. And so we did grant the vast majority of those requests. But collections, frankly, were quite good through the quarter. And so as we move through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that's likely to continue, or at least we've seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So clearly, we're starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position, and we're still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections."

Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions pause for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We've begun to work through that during the quarter. And so right now, we're sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable as we ended the quarter was actually down a little bit year-over-year. Stepping back, it's obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, running spaces and collecting rent. And I think we saw good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them, and we saw good payment activity and rental activity. I think there's also broader things that work. There's no question that governments stimulus -- government support for many individuals throughout the economy we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individual's finances."

There's no question at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had again, in the March and April time frame, a handful of assets that have been already vetted. We still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals towards the earlier part of the quarter. And then as things settle down, we actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates pre-pandemic would be stabilized assets. There's still a lot of capital on the sidelines that's out looking for those types of investments. What we've done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints they may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I'll tell you that. And with that, we've got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we've got a few assets that are in motion, and we're confident that we'll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing maybe no surprise a few more landholding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions in land, maybe have taken them through various stages entitlement that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what's going on with rates across most markets are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities, and we'll see how this continues to play forth in the coming quarters."

But as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place."

So the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So you'll see some moderation down in the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter.

And as I highlighted, not only did we not send those during the second quarter when we resent them and are sending increases in the second half, they are at lower magnitude, given some of the regulations and things that we're doing to be mindful of the environment. So as you think about contribution to second quarter rental rate trends, you saw that, on average, rent per occupied square foot was down 2% in the second quarter. The largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increases. The rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed are move-in and move-out trend throughout the second quarter, which was also here clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter."

So the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged and move-in. And so that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you've seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you're going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lean and lean sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So if a customer doesn't pay the rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That's where we saw improving collection trends reduce the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that, that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July, but the composition of the driver changed as we move through the quarter. In the month of April and the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers' request. Some sort of customer accommodation or either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief, and the majority of that was granted. As we move through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished, and collection trends improved such that by the time we got into June, that down 30% and fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends, and that's continued through July. In terms of how much into the future, we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It's hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. I don't think I would have sat here and told you that. But now having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends even as we get into August here, it does feel like it's part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there's no question there's bigger factors there at work. And so it's certainly a potential driver of lower same-store revenues in the second half because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter."

We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway, relative to those deliveries taking place, although some of them are taking longer, no surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections, again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into the level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based, again, on what I mentioned earlier, there will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition -- or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be, but it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been hit heavy with new supply.

It's still dominated by properties that are going through various phases of construction, although we are also seeing stabilized and/or lease-up assets coming into the portfolio and the platform as well. So not unlike what we saw in the acquisition arena, to some degree, it got a little quieter for a month or 2 on the early part of the pandemic. But as things have settled down, we're seeing good activity, and we continue to bring new properties into the platform, whether they're new, and we're actually opening them. We opened, again, several in the quarter, and we're bringing more into the portfolios are going through different phases of completion and development. The backlog is healthy, and we're continuing to add to it."

I think we've spoken about this, I'll reiterate some of the comments. I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry, but I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better cash trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to the conducting auctions that's reduced the amount of backlog. So a combination of conducting lean sales as well as better collections, leading to about 20 basis points age delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways as I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we help the customers that we're having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country, folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight that collections were good. Through the second quarter, I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies they would likely say something similar. 
So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward. And that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. I think to maybe one more stat as we just throw stats around on this particular topic, I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier, and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it, and we're working with them and obviously, working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well."

It's typical for a property to take 3 or 4 years to go through not only occupancy lease-up at the level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing accelerated lease-up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because, again, we're even seeing that acceleration right now. We're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which it takes up to that 3 to 4 years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store. And again, look at the stability that typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the time frame for stabilization."

Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the health care impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict. No question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1% is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that -- right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases, but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough health care environment. 
And so I think it's hard to project going forward right now, magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move-in and move-out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move-outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move-outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the health care situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think, will likely impact our move-in and move-out trends as well. So I know that's a long-winded way of saying I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move-in place rents."

I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the health care environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move-ins and move-outs has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our submarkets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends, and it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go.

Yes, there's no question, as I noted, that we've been very determined and focused on the amount of volume we've been able to pull into the portfolio, coupled with, obviously, a number of crosscurrents. So if you step back and think about the last 4 months during the pandemic, we kind of think of going through 4 different phases. And the early part of the pandemic March and April, we did a number of things to ensure all the right safety protocols. We suspended auctions and really make sure that our entire environment was safe and secure as we were able to continue to operate all of our properties. We saw a little bit of degradation in demand after an initial rush that came to us through primarily college and university shutting down early. So we saw a bit of a rush, but then not long after that, we started to see a bit of degradation. But then going into the next phase, the second phase, we began to put even more focus on customer focus. We, again, suspended auctions, and we opened up to a degree, some of the customer accommodation practices, again, to be reflective of the environment. And we became more focused on different tools around top-of-funnel demand through advertising and other things that were proving to be actually quite effective. So we started to see the residual benefit of that. And again, a lift in demand and move-in volume. The next phase, again, we continue along those same lines, but continue to put even more focus on the ways in which we were able to draw new customers to the portfolio, while month-after-month, seeing a very positive impact from far fewer move-outs. And then finally, the most recent phase, as we stand through the month of July, we've actually now gone back to auctions. We have reinstituted rent increases in many parts of the portfolio. And again, we're starting to see very good reaction to the amount of activity, both on move-ins and lack of -- or the lower move-outs. So speaking to the second half of the year, yes, we do see a number of different pressures that I'll have Tom walk you through in a little bit more detail. But overall, as I noted, we've been very pleased by the overall resiliency and the ability on our part to continue to drive this level of demand. And literally, we are dealing with, in many markets, record-high levels of occupancy.
Tom, why don't you give a little bit more color on the second half of the year?"

So as Joe mentioned, operating metrics really started to improve as we moved through the second quarter and have continued that post quarter we can spend more time there, if you like. But I think part of your question was around the discussion around same-store revenue trends. So how do those operating metrics translate to financial metrics. And while operating metrics improved throughout the second quarter. Financial metrics, we saw revenue growth in the same store pool deteriorate. So if you think about the second quarter in aggregate into components. Same-store occupancy was up about 20 basis points. Same-store rents were down 2%. So that leads you to your negative 1.8% performance for rental income in the same store pool in the second quarter. Fee collections were down 32% in the quarter. Those fee collections were down for 2 primary reasons. Earlier in the quarter, it related to customer accommodations and customers requesting fee relief. And so we did grant the vast majority of those requests. But collections, frankly, were quite good through the quarter. And so as we move through the second quarter, our fee collections were lower year-over-year on about a 30% basis because customers were paying us sooner. And we anticipate that's likely to continue, or at least we've seen it continue through July at this point, which is leading to lower fee collections. So that was the second quarter. As we think about the other component of your question around the second half, I just highlighted that rents were down 2% in the second quarter on average. We ended the quarter down 3.1% on contract rents. So clearly, we're starting the third quarter in a lower year-over-year rent growth position, and we're still seeing fee collections lower because of good collections."

Collection trends through the quarter were good. We had customers that were paying us earlier. We did have customers that while we had auctions pause for a period of time, stayed with us for a longer period of time. We've begun to work through that during the quarter. And so right now, we're sitting with about 20 basis points of occupancy that is delayed auction activities. But as you think about bad debt through the quarter, it was pretty consistent year-over-year. And frankly, as we sit here today, away from what was written off in the second quarter, the receivable as we ended the quarter was actually down a little bit year-over-year. Stepping back, it's obviously a focus of the team to focus on basics through the quarter, running spaces and collecting rent. And I think we saw good customer reaction and validation that our spaces are important to them, and we saw good payment activity and rental activity. I think there's also broader things that work. There's no question that governments stimulus -- government support for many individuals throughout the economy we suspect helped our collection trends through the quarter. And as we look across industries, credit cards or otherwise, many other industries are seeing similar collection trends as the government has done a good bit to support individual's finances."

There's no question at the beginning of the pandemic, investment market on many fronts basically went into pause mode. We had again, in the March and April time frame, a handful of assets that have been already vetted. We still thought they were very attractive investments for us to make. We closed on those deals towards the earlier part of the quarter. And then as things settle down, we actually began to see and continue through today a bit of an elevation of return to market and/or just conversations that we had in motion prior to the pandemic, a variety of different deals that continue to be particularly attractive. So for the most part, the types of assets that are commanding normal or consistent cap rates pre-pandemic would be stabilized assets. There's still a lot of capital on the sidelines that's out looking for those types of investments. What we've done alternatively is look for, again, value opportunities particularly around assets that may not be stabilized and/or in parts of our markets that we think round out our presence. So we are seeing a little bit more opening up of owners that are coming back to the market, some of which do not see a way to basically get out of some of the constraints they may be under for either lending reasons or not making the yields that they had expected. And those conversations are becoming more vibrant, I'll tell you that. And with that, we've got, again, as we pointed to in the press release, we've got a few assets that are in motion, and we're confident that we'll probably see more. There still are very few bigger portfolios on the market today. We are also seeing maybe no surprise a few more landholding opportunities coming up as well, where again, owners that have taken down positions in land, maybe have taken them through various stages entitlement that are not again seeing the pro forma and return expectations come through, particularly with what's going on with rates across most markets are looking for a way to come out of those positions. So the acquisition team is busy looking at many different types of opportunities, and we'll see how this continues to play forth in the coming quarters."

In terms of the breadth of it across the country, those increases are broadly spread throughout the country. So in the vast majority of the country, we're able to send existing tenant rate increases. The magnitude of them compared to prior years, though, is lower. And we did that on a test basis on July 1 to try to understand consumer behavior during the pandemic, and we saw encouraging trends there. But as we look forward, there are headwinds to sending the same sorts of increases as we did in prior years really related to state and local jurisdictions and the price-related regulations there. And so we would anticipate that the magnitude of the increases will be lower on a year-over-year basis for the next several months or longer, depending on how long those regulations stay in place."

So the pay rate increase did end at the end of the second quarter. So you'll see some moderation down in the elevated cost of payroll, which was about 20% in the second quarter.

So as you think about contribution to second quarter rental rate trends, you saw that, on average, rent per occupied square foot was down 2% in the second quarter. The largest component of that decline from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter was really no or very little contribution from existing tenant rate increases. The rest of it was rent roll down, which we disclosed are move-in and move-out trend throughout the second quarter, which was also here clearly contributing factors, particularly early on in the quarter."

So the different components of the late charges and administrative fees break down into several components. One is administrative fees that are charged and move-in. And so that line item will trend based on move-in volumes. And you've seen that over time, if move-in volumes are down, you're going to see those admin fees be a little bit down. So we did see that in the second quarter. The other charges are related to late and then lean and lean sale fees, the largest component of it being late fees. So if a customer doesn't pay the rent on time, a fee is charged to their account. That's where we saw improving collection trends reduce the amount of fees collected as we move through the quarter. I would say that, that down 32% in fees collected actually remained somewhat consistent through the second quarter and into July, but the composition of the driver changed as we move through the quarter. In the month of April and the first part of May, the majority of the driver there was fee accommodation, customers requesting fee relief. I shared on the last call that during the month of April, we had about 7% of our customers' request. Some sort of customer accommodation or either rent or fee relief. The majority of that was fee relief, and the majority of that was granted. As we move through the quarter, the amount of requests that we received diminished, and collection trends improved such that by the time we got into June, that down 30% and fee collections was driven primarily by better collection trends, and that's continued through July. In terms of how much into the future, we can anticipate the fee trends will remain that way. It's hard to call. You would have asked us in March, whether collections would be meaningfully better year-over-year as we move through the quarter. I don't think I would have sat here and told you that. But now having seen it for a number of months and seen it through the month of July and good trends even as we get into August here, it does feel like it's part of the environment. And as I highlighted, there's no question there's bigger factors there at work. And so it's certainly a potential driver of lower same-store revenues in the second half because we continue to see it play out through the third quarter."

We have a fair amount of both new development acquisition opportunities for customers to move-in, and we've seen an inordinate amount of move-in activity, which has been quite a good surprise or a good benefit based on a number of things we're seeing from a trend standpoint. So I mentioned that we've moved in about 400,000 customers in the last 4 months. If you just look at Q2 of the 300,000 or so customers have moved in, 60,000 of those move-ins came into our non-same-store portfolio. The non-same-store portfolio continues to do quite well from an occupancy growth standpoint, and we're up about 11%. And continue to see very good trends and tractions relative to both new builds, redevelopment and acquisitions that we've added into the portfolio that total pulled about 13.5 million square feet, and we continue to see very good performance and fill ups across all markets. Frankly, we haven't seen any of our acquisitions development going backwards in this environment, they have done the absolute opposite where they're filling up pretty dramatically."

There is still a healthy amount of supply that continues to be delivered into 2020. Last quarter, we talked about the likelihood that it would be anywhere, say, 15% to 20% or so less than what was predicted, which would 0.2%, plus or minus have $5 billion or so level of deliveries in 2020. We think that's probably closer to $4 billion or less. There doesn't appear to be any slowdown this year anyway, relative to those deliveries taking place, although some of them are taking longer, no surprise, many cities have slowed down their own approval processes, whether through inspections, again, final occupancy permits, et cetera. So we still think that there's a healthy amount of supply. It kind of goes into the level of supply you saw in the 2017 or so era. Now looking out to '21 and beyond, I would expect, based, again, on what I mentioned earlier, there will likely be more constraints around funding that many of these developers look for relative to construction loans. And again, the investment hurdles that either they and/or their partners are going to require to move forward on any particular acquisition -- or any particular development, excuse me. So we're likely to see, again, another leg down. I don't know how hard and dramatic that might be, but it would be a welcome relief, particularly in the markets that we've been pointing to over the last couple of years that have been hit heavy with new supply. So too soon to tell yet the lingering impact into '21 and beyond, but we're likely to see, again, another leg down."

I think we've spoken about this, I'll reiterate some of the comments. I obviously can't speak to what others are seeing in the industry, but I'll comment on what we're seeing, which we did see better cash trends and that's driving lower fees. It's also, as we move back to the conducting auctions that's reduced the amount of backlog. So a combination of conducting lean sales as well as better collections, leading to about 20 basis points age delinquency. I would highlight that we obviously worked with customers throughout the second quarter on different ways as I highlighted, about 7% of our customers requested some form of relief in the second quarter, and we're very receptive to those sorts of requests as we help the customers that we're having a tough time. But those really started to moderate as we move through the quarter. And as Joe highlighted, as we move through the different phases of the second quarter, we started to see better trends there. I think your comment around government support is a good one. And I do think that be it unemployment benefits or $1,200 checks. There's no question that across the country, folks got some support through the second quarter, which likely helped collections in our business and in many businesses. And I don't think we're alone to highlight that collections were good. Through the second quarter, I think if you were to listen to banks or to credit card companies they would likely say something similar. 
So I think that there is some support there. And ultimately, we'll see what the trajectory is of that support going forward. And that could certainly have an impact on our collection trends and others in the industry as well. But we generally covered most of the different components of it. I think to maybe one more stat as we just throw stats around on this particular topic, I highlighted that customers are paying us earlier, and that's resulted in, if you just look at the snapshot at June 30, our rent receivable from customers who are less than 60 days is down about 35%. So customers are paying for their storage space and finding good value in it, and we're working with them and obviously, working with those that have been impacted by the pandemic to make sure that they receive the appropriate accommodation as well."

It's typical for a property to take 3 or 4 years to go through not only occupancy lease-up at the level of stability and stabilization that you're going to see from the maturing of the customer base, et cetera. So if anything, as I've mentioned, we've actually been seeing accelerated lease-up in properties that we put into development, redevelopment or even acquisition. And again, just because, again, we're even seeing that acceleration right now. We're not stepping back and retooling or resetting expectations. We'll have to see over time how this demand continues to trend. But it begins with the same premise, which it takes up to that 3 to 4 years typically for a property to get to that level of stabilization. We're going to look at that time period typically to decide whether or not to put the property in the same store. And again, look at the stability that typically plays out across different markets, et cetera. So no real change yet in the way that we're modeling and looking at the time frame for stabilization."

Unfortunately, I don't have a crystal ball in terms of exactly how the environment is going to play out from here. We're absolutely in an uncertain environment and one that none of us have lived through in the past to be able to understand what the health care impact, what the government policy impact will be and where we go from here is hard to predict. No question starting the quarter with contract rents down 3.1% is a much worse place than where we started the second quarter from a year-over-year standpoint. The benefits we have going into the third and fourth quarter are that -- right now, we are sending existing tenant rate increases, but we're also being mindful of what the local jurisdictions regulations are around that and also the impact to our customer base in what is a tough health care environment. 
And so I think it's hard to project going forward right now, magnitude of those increases is lower year-over-year. So that's not going to be a meaningful contributor to the upside of rental rate growth. And move-in and move-out trends, we're seeing good demand trends now and lower move-outs. We've highlighted in the past that in the last downturn, we did see elevated move-outs. We've seen the exact opposite this time to date. But we're also mindful that the health care situation could be having a significant impact on those trends. And as we move through this year and into next year, the developments on those fronts, I think, will likely impact our move-in and move-out trends as well. So I know that's a long-winded way of saying I don't really know when things would change materially. But I gave you a sense of what some of the drivers would be that would move-in place rents."

I think Joe highlighted the improving operating trends. If you looked at it on a market-by-market basis, I would say the health care environment and situation was the biggest driver of market variance of operating trends in April. But as we move through the quarter into June and July, the biggest differentials from a market standpoint on operating trends, like move-ins and move-outs has been more the typical things that we would have been talking about, the impact of new supply in many of our submarkets. And I think that's likely to persist here, as Joe mentioned, future deliveries. So I don't think the operating environment is such that while we've seen improving trends, and it's going to get materially better in any sort of base case. But ultimately, we'll see where we go.

We've been tracking it through the pandemic and spoke about the early months where a number of sellers paused and were reticent to bring properties into the market. But we've clearly seen many more do the reverse where they've looked at this environment as an opportune time to bring assets into the acquisition arena. The thing -- a number of things are continuing to fuel that. One is it's still a very good time to do a trade. There's very low interest rates, availability of capital, there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that's been anxious to get into the storage sector. And frankly, the storage sector continues to perform well. So there's been a window of opportunity that we've seen increase over the last month, particularly in the quarter that set us up well to have a very active 2020. The things that we continue to do are look for assets that are particularly well positioned from a location and quality standpoint that meet our requirements relative to location, and opportunity to round out presence, whether they're in our prime core markets or other markets that we want to add additional product to. The thing that was unusual, and we're encouraged by, as we also, as you asked, have a sizable single portfolio under contract that we think is a great set of assets that will be very good for us to bring into the portfolio. In total, it's 36 properties across 15 markets, 13 different states. 24 of the assets are open and operating, but they're relatively new. Average age is 2 to 3 years, I would call them Class A properties in very good locations, and we're very excited to bring them into the portfolio, knowing that we're looking for opportunities to lease-up properties because we have very good customer demand. So they'll be easily integrated, and we anticipate closing the first 24 of those assets by the end of the year. With that portfolio, which we're also well poised to capture and look for some, I think, interesting growth and performance opportunities as there's 12 additional properties in various phases of development that will be completed through 2021. Again, Class A, well-located assets, and we're really pleased by the ability to capture that total portfolio. 
Another interesting part of the portfolio, it was -- it is an off-market deal. So it speaks to the level of relationships that we continue to build across the storage sector. This relationship has evolved over a longer period of time, and we continue to look for those opportunities where they may play through. Beyond the large portfolio that I just talked about, we're also seeing a number of smaller opportunities, which we've been seeing through 2020 and frankly, what we saw even in 2019. And so with that, we're poised to have a very strong acquisition year this year. I would tell you from a cap rate standpoint, with the amount of capital and the cost of that capital. We're really not seeing any easing of cap rates, and we'll have to continue to monitor that. We clearly have good access to capital. Ourselves, our own cost of capital continues to be very attractive. Tom can give you a little color later in the call about what we see relative to funding through either the preferred market or the debt markets. But we're clearly seeing some good opportunities to put that capital to work, and we are continuing to look and hunt for additional acquisitions going forward."

This is Tom, around what we've been doing through the quarter on existing tenants and then what we think the outlook is. As we noted in the 10-Q, we did resume, and we discussed on the last call, we resumed existing tenant rate increases in the third quarter. We did so initially on a test basis and have since increased the volumes of those rental rate increases that we've sent out as we've grown more confident in the performance of our existing tenants. 
Since we didn't send any increases in the second quarter, we did have a backlog of potential tenants to increase rent on in the third quarter, and we did send those catch up rental rate increases. As you noted, those increases went out with a lower magnitude out of increase given overall mindfulness of our customer base in this crisis environment, and as you highlighted, still very dynamic, as well as state and local price regulations in many of our markets. We expect that to continue as we move through future quarters, certainly navigating this dynamic health care environment is unpredictable. We would expect that the existing tenant rate increases will continue to be a modest drag on in-place rent growth as we move forward. 
Stepping back, customer activity has been solid. And I just highlighted the existing tenant performance has been good. That's across the board. So that collections are better, payment patterns have accelerated, move-outs are down, length of stays are extending and new customer demand is solid. So we're seeing good trends there. And overall, move-in activity has been good. But existing tenants will continue to be a modest drag going forward."

As we rewind to April and early May, we had move-in volumes and move out volumes that were lower. But as we moved into May and June and then into the third quarter, move-in activity has increased, but move-out activity has remained muted. And dissecting the geographies, the customer tenures, the customer segments with which move-outs are lower, it is really across the board and clearly being driven by the current health care environment. And you highlighted and we discussed in the 10-Q and the MD&A, the likelihood at point that rate of deceleration in, and we talked about in previous calls, the fact that in other recessionary environments, we've actually seen the opposite play through with higher move-outs given consumer stress. We've not experienced at this time. And in fact, it was pretty consistent through the third quarter to give you a sense, each of the months in the third quarter saw 12% to 15% decline in move-out volumes. And as I mentioned, it's geographies across customers, end urbans and customer segments. So really broad-based decline in move-outs, paired with good collection activity, and accepting the rental rate increases that we've sent to date. So we've encouraged by the [Audio Gap] what could play out as we move in this dynamic environment and we do watch previously. But through October, move-outs continue to be lower."

So what's playing through right now that again, by month, we're seeing more sustained and consistent consumer behavior. Work from home is additive, meeting is another fact that we're seeing from a survey standpoint. Relative to the customers coming to the portfolio and what's driving that decision. You've got a number of markets, whether you label them as urban or high-density and/or related to even concentrations of tax, I'll use the Bay Area, for instance, where we see system-wide, our highest level of occupancies. Thousands of employees have been given the lot to move out of that market, either temporarily or potentially permanently and are shifting and amplifying the need for self-storage as either they're dealing with this and the flexibility that they've got to work at either at home or complication, seeing similar impacts, right, again, in the heart of New York set of assets. So that's additive. The housing market is very strong right now. That's always a traditional and very good driver for our business. But housing sales are up over 20% as we speak on a year-over-year basis, and it's a driver. So you've got layers of different consumer patterns that are playing through that are pointing to more sustained and prolonged need for storage space. So we don't know when and to what degree it will shift back to a ""normal environment"", but the amount of sustained activity that we're seeing now into the 8 month of this health crisis continues to be quite good fit."

And so we did increase our spend over the last several years and have liked the returns that we've seen, utilizing advertising spend, and that really is across paid surge it social media, we use television in the second quarter, kind of a broad-based advertising approach to attract new customers. 
We do have real advantages in using advertising as a tool, given our brand name and presence online. And so we like that too, and we will continue to use it as we navigate this dynamic environment. In the second quarter, given lower top of funnel demand, we were more aggressive on marketing spend. And as top of funnel demand improved as we moved into the third quarter, we removed some of that advertising support. But as you note, our advertising spend was up about 8% or 9% in the quarter, and we will continue to use that tool as we play through what's a dynamic environment, but we did not need the level of support we saw in the second quarter given improved top of funnel trends."

And then really since July first seen an improvement in top of funnel demand, pair that with respectivity, as I just highlighted, means that occupancy has moved higher in really all of our markets across the country. And that improved occupancy certainly reduced the inventory levels that we had. And that really persisted through the quarter. We finished the second quarter up about 50 basis points in occupancy. We finished the third quarter up 200 basis points proceeding here. We finished October, up 230 basis points in occupancy and so customer trends being move-in and move-out have been good. And with lower inventory, that's allowed us to achieve higher move-in rates. Our move-in rates were up 8.2% in the quarter in October to give you a sense, the strength of top of funnel and the move-out trends have continued, which has led move-in volumes to be up about 1% in October and move-in rates up about 10%.

So part of the flexibility, for instance, if you look at the Bay Area that many tech workers have been given is when a big employer, whom you -- anyone of us can point to gives signals and/or time frames where they may not be pulling their employees back not for 1 or 2 months for 6 months to a year, coupled with giving them full flexibility to be somewhere else. That could vary. So some employees will still come back. There's no question about that, but it may be for several months or several quarters, depending again on the unknown timing of the pandemic itself. And then to what degree these become permanent relocations and then some commensurate impact on the need to keep goods or whatever they're keeping it in one of our units in that particular market will be a question and can predict it, don't know. Fortunately, if you look at the, we have an opportunity to stand out there because we've got a very well-placed portfolio. It's very difficult to add new supply there. So the different need for that space in term is quite high. There's no question about it. And it's difficult to build there. So it's not a market by any means that from an oversupply standpoint et cetera. This has just been a very unusual environment where this demand has been so elevated, where I mentioned we've got system high occupancies of 97%, 98% this time a year. I mean, we have never seen that before. So it's to be determined. It's hard to predict. And the flexibility and the way in which employees, whether they're tech-oriented or other traditional office users change over time is to be determined. But as Tom mentioned, we're seeing -- it's just in these are more dense markets. We're seeing healthy demand across the entire system. We frankly don't have a market that's down in occupancy. It continues to percolate our lease-up of our newly built and required assets is very strong. And consumer demand continues to be very, very active, particularly for this time a year."

The thing that I do that we'll be closing this quarter is the about [Audio Gap] 35% of that we look at that as a very good thing relative to, again, the opportunity to lease-up space based on the demand factors that we're seeing the great locations that these assets are tied to and the quality of the assets. So it's a very good opportunity for us to stabilize those assets to put our own marketing and operational tactics and strategies into them. And we feel like we'll have very good returns once we get the assets stabilized. As you well know, that can take anywhere from 3 to 4 years on a normalized basis, not only once you get to stabilized occupants at more stabilized revenue and pricing metrics. So we'll continue to look for, again, the stabilization of those assets. But as I mentioned, pretty high-quality, good, solid assets and adds, in many ways, you could consider it almost like a near-term or more recently delivered developments on our part. So again, very good opportunity to drive good value from them."

And when I look at your same-store revenue, it improved slightly to negative 2.7% from minus 3% last quarter. Obviously, the underlying drivers are pointing towards a much better place, right, where fee-based rates are up 8%, better occupancy and things like that. So I was wondering if you could just provide some more details behind the transitory nature of the underlying drivers and how that might benefit same-store revenue going forward, in particular, things like existing customer rate increases. I'm not sure how much normally, it contributes whereas in 3Q it didn't? And going forward, how do we expect that to normalize? Just to understand that magnitude a little better?"

I think we spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward, and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating me",414,"Sure, Ki Bin, it's Tom. I think we spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward, and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating metrics have removed more quickly than financial metrics, and we -- let's pick a part of the occupancy and rate equation. I commented earlier around how occupancy trends have improved with a combination of better top of funnel activity as well as lower move-out volumes. And so that's improved occupancy trends. In many of our markets, we have reached occupancies that are meaning we are at 97%, 98% occupancy in the middle of the month, which is friction in our industry. So it's a matter of what play through with some of those markets as we move forward. As you just highlighted and we spoke about earlier, existing tenant rate increases are not going to be contributing factor to improving rent trends, given the magnitude of the increases are likely to be lower as we move forward through the fourth quarter. That said, just looking at in-place rents from June 30 -- at June 30 in-place rents were down 3.1%, and we finished the quarter September 30, down 1.8%. And and with existing tenants not contributing to that improvement, that negative impact was more than offset by improved customer activity and the reduction of rent roll down. If you look at the third quarter of 2019, rent roll down was about 15%. And as we moved into the third quarter of 2020, that narrowed down to about 4%. So that roll down more than offsetting the degradation from existing tenant rate increase drag in the quarter. 
Looking forward, aggregate contract rents recovered. So occupancy and rent combined to positive 20 basis points at September 30 and we've continued to see good customer trends through October. So better rental income trends. Fees, which have been a negative contributor to revenue growth in both the second and third quarters, we anticipate to continue to do so as we move forward, and that's really driven by customers paying their rent, which is a great thing, but is a degradation in revenue and the growth. So I think we spoke a little bit about that on the last call, Ki Bin, but we continue to see that, and we'd anticipate that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year."

So throughout this year, we've redeemed about $1.2 billion of preferred. We haven't issued quite that much yet, and we were active in the bond market in Europe in January. Financing markets, as Joe highlighted earlier, are as attractive as they have ever been. Preferreds are sub-4% for us today, which is a record low, which presents that opportunity, and we have great access to debt capital, too. As we said in previous settings, we'll look to utilize both preferreds and debt for incremental financing activity as we move through 2021 for both preferred refinancing as well as for potential acquisition opportunities and development, which clearly, as Joe highlighted earlier, is as we move through the fourth quarter. So access but we'll utilize both, and we hope that we have the opportunity to refinance in 2021, like we did in 2020 and 2019."

Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or a shift up and down. I already talked a little bit about the work-from-home demand factor. That's clearly new at this level of magnitude. And whether or not that sustains from a demand stat standpoint after the pandemic settles down or not is to be determined. Many companies are looking at work-from-home platforms as different in way of enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction, but the theoretical argument against that is there may be the office of going through, too. So it's a little bit hard to predict. And at the moment, we're just going to continue to survey and understand and see these drivers. But interesting thing is they're all additive, and they're continuing to drive, as we've talked about, very optimized performance. We'll continue to learn from this, and it's brought, frankly, a healthy and new set of customers into the storage sector, never used the product before. So I think long term, that's a good thing. The adoption of the product continues to grow statistically. And it once again, is proving that the product is highly resilient, it's highly adaptable and consumers like it. The things that we continue to do also are find ways of making the customer interaction that much more effective, making it a much more easy decision and transaction. So many of the tools that we've been putting into our technological channels and options for customers are serving us well, about 40-plus percent of our move-in volume in the third quarter came from our e-rental platform that, frankly, was in test mode before the pandemic came about, but statistically, we moved in 115,000 customers directly through that a channel transaction takes about 5 minutes and love it. And that's not just because of the pandemic. It's just a great and easy way to capture a storage unit. So we've got different things that we're also able to test in a very challenging environment like this that are frankly giving us even new and different tools that could lead to different levels of dealing with customers in a very different way than we were doing before that, again, are very aligned with their ability to think even more positively about needing a storage facility because it's that much used or easier to capture and is that much more cost effective."

So we have different ways for us to step back and understand the relative ultimate capital allocation performance and ability to drive value through not only our acquisition environment, but our development and redevelopment activities.

That's tied to some intentional investments that we've made from an LED standpoint. So we've now got our entire 2,600-or-so portfolio on exterior LED lights, and we transitioned maybe about 1/3 so far the portfolio from an interior standpoint to LED. So we're seeing nice savings relative to the utility cost. Again, utilities were down a little over 9% in the quarter. Repairs and maintenance were down. That can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on some of the repairs necessary across the portfolio, but we saw a good metric there. And overall, we continue to look for ways of optimizing costs.

So I'll provide a little bit more color around customer collections in aggregate because that is the primary reason why fees are down. And so as we look at rent collections, really starting in the second quarter and persisting through the third have been very solid. And some of the things you highlighted are contributing, i.e., auto Pay is at a modestly higher percentage. But even away from auto pay tenants, customer payment patterns have accelerated, and we're charging less in terms of fees. And so obviously, if you don't charge it, you're not going to collect it. Our receivable to be down around 30% through the quarter, and that's persisted through the delinquency period for tenants, meaning that receivables down about 30%. We wrote off about 30% less rent. We have about 30% fewer auctions in the quarter. So overall customer health and payment patterns have improved, and that has led to lower fees primarily from late fees, which are charged for customers not paying their rent within a grace period, but also contributed from longer into the delinquency period, lean fees and lean sale fees, but primarily driven by the grace period ending late fee in the first month of customers delinquency."

We've been tracking it through the pandemic and spoke about the early months where a number of sellers paused and were reticent to bring properties into the market. But we've clearly seen many more do the reverse where they've looked at this environment as an opportune time to bring assets into the acquisition arena. The thing -- a number of things are continuing to fuel that. One is it's still a very good time to do a trade. There's very low interest rates, availability of capital, there's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines that's been anxious to get into the storage sector. And frankly, the storage sector continues to perform well. So there's been a window of opportunity that we've seen increase over the last month, particularly in the quarter that set us up well to have a very active 2020.
The things that we continue to do are look for assets that are particularly well positioned from a location and quality standpoint that meet our requirements relative to location, and opportunity to round out presence, whether they're in our prime core markets or other markets that we want to add additional product to. The thing that was unusual, and we're encouraged by, as we also, as you asked, have a sizable single portfolio under contract that we think is a great set of assets that will be very good for us to bring into the portfolio. In total, it's 36 properties across 15 markets, 13 different states. 24 of the assets are open and operating, but they're relatively new. Average age is 2 to 3 years. I would call them Class A properties in very good locations, and we're very excited to bring them into the portfolio, knowing that we're looking for opportunities to lease-up properties because we have very good customer demand.
So they'll be easily integrated, and we anticipate closing the first 24 of those assets by the end of the year. With that portfolio, which we're also well poised to capture and look for some, I think, interesting growth and performance opportunities as there's 12 additional properties in various phases of development that will be completed through 2021. Again, Class A, well-located assets, and we're really pleased by the ability to capture that total portfolio. Another interesting part of the portfolio, it was -- it is an off-market deal. So it speaks to the level of relationships that we continue to build across the storage sector. This relationship has evolved over a longer period of time, and we continue to look for those opportunities where they may play through.
Beyond the large portfolio that I just talked about, we're also seeing a number of smaller opportunities, which we've been seeing through 2020 and frankly, what we saw even in 2019. So with that, we're poised to have a very strong acquisition year this year. I would tell you from a cap rate standpoint, with the amount of capital and the cost of that capital, we're really not seeing any easing of cap rates, and we'll have to continue to monitor that. We clearly have good access to capital. Ourselves, our own cost of capital continues to be very attractive. Tom can give you a little color later in the call about what we see relative to funding through either the preferred market or the debt markets. But we're clearly seeing some good opportunities to put that capital to work, and we are continuing to look and hunt for additional acquisitions going forward."

Well, let me give you a little bit of context, this is Tom, around what we've been doing through the quarter on existing tenants and then what we think the outlook is. As we noted in the 10-Q, we did resume, and we discussed on the last call, we resumed existing tenant rate increases in the third quarter. We did so initially on a test basis and have since increased the volumes of those rental rate increases that we've sent out as we've grown more confident in the performance of our existing tenants.
Since we didn't send any increases in the second quarter, we did have a ""backlog"" of potential tenants to increase rent on in the third quarter, and we did send those catch-up rental rate increases. As you noted, those increases went out with a lower magnitude of increase, given overall mindfulness of our customer base in this crisis environment, and as you highlighted, still very dynamic, as well as state and local price regulations in many of our markets. We expect some of that to continue as we move through future quarters. Certainly, navigating this dynamic health care environment is unpredictable. We would expect that the existing tenant rate increases will continue to be a modest drag on in-place rent growth as we move forward.
Stepping back, customer activity has been solid. And I just highlighted the existing tenant performance has been good. That's across the board. So that collections are better, payment patterns have accelerated, move-outs are down, length of stays are extending and new customer demand is solid. So we're seeing good trends there. And overall, move-in activity has been good. But existing tenants will continue to be a modest drag going forward."

So I'll provide a little context around the move-out activity because it has been one of the surprises as we move through this pandemic period. As we rewind to April and early May, we had move-in volumes and move out volumes that were lower. But as we moved into May and June and then into the third quarter, move-in activity has increased, but move-out activity has remained muted. And dissecting the geographies, the customer tenures, the customer segments with which move-outs are lower, it is really across the board and clearly being driven by the current health care environment. 
And you highlighted and we discussed in the 10-Q and the MD&A the likelihood at some point that that rate of deceleration will moderate, and we talked about in previous calls, the fact that in other recessionary environments, we've actually seen the opposite play through with higher move-outs given consumer stress. But we've not experienced that this time. And in fact, it was pretty consistent through the third quarter. To give you a sense, each of the months in the third quarter saw 12% to 15% declines in move-out volumes. And as I mentioned, it's across geographies, across customer tenure bands and customer segments.
So really broad-based decline in move-outs, paired with good collection activity, and accepting the rental rate increases that we've sent to date. So we've encouraged by the existing tenants. We do have a -- our eyes on what could play out as we move in this dynamic environment, and we'll be watching that very closely. But through October, move-outs continue to be lower."

So what's playing through right now that, again, month by month, we're seeing more sustained and consistent consumer behavior. Work-from-home is additive, meaning is another factor that we're seeing from a survey standpoint relative to the customers coming to the portfolio and what's driving that decision. You've got a number of markets, whether you label them as urban or high-density and/or related to even concentrations of tax, I'll use the Bay Area, for instance, where we see system-wide, our highest level of occupancies.
Thousands of employees have been given the latitude to move out of that market, either temporarily or potentially permanently, and are shifting and amplifying the need for self-storage as either they're dealing with the health crisis and the flexibility that they've got to work at either at home or a completely different location. Seeing similar impacts, right, again, in the heart of our New York set of assets. So that's additive. The housing market is very strong right now. That's always a traditional and very good driver for our business. But housing sales are up over 20% as we speak on a year-over-year basis, and it's a driver.

So we don't know when and to what degree it will shift back to a ""normal environment"", but the amount of sustained activity that we're seeing now into the 8th month of this health crisis continues to be quite good."

So stepping back on marketing spend, that's been a tool that we've utilized along with promotional discounts and move-in rates over the past several years and what was a tough customer acquisition environment, given the impact of new supply in many of our markets. And so we did increase our spend over the last several years and have liked the returns that we've seen utilizing advertising spend, and that really is across paid search affiliates, social media, we used television in the second quarter, kind of a broad-based advertising approach to attract new customers.
We do have real advantages in using advertising as a tool, given our brand name and presence online. And so we like that tool, and we will continue to use it as we navigate this dynamic environment. In the second quarter, given lower top-of-funnel demand, we were more aggressive on marketing spend. And as top-of-funnel demand improved as we moved into the third quarter, we removed some of that advertising support. But as you note, our advertising spend was up about 8% or 9% in the quarter, and we will continue to use that tool as we play through what's a dynamic environment, but we did not need the level of support we saw in the second quarter given improved top-of-funnel trends."

We did see move-in activity kind of surge in March. Then we saw it really slow down in April. We moved into a third phase that we call internally kind of recovery in May and June. And then really since July 1, we've seen an improvement in top-of-funnel demand. Pair that with reduced move-out activity, as I just highlighted, means that occupancy has moved higher in really all of our markets across the country. And that improved occupancy, certainly, reduced the inventory levels that we had. And that really persisted through the quarter.
We finished the second quarter up about 50 basis points in occupancy. We finished the third quarter up 200 basis points. We're sitting here, we finished October up 230 basis points in occupancy. And so customer trends, be in move-in and move-out, have been good. And with lower inventory, that's allowed us to achieve higher move-in rates. In move-in rates, were up 8.2% in the quarter in October. To give you a sense, the strength of top-of-funnel and the move-out trends have continued, which has led move-in volumes to be up about 1% in October and move-in rates up about 10%.
So the trends have continued and obviously, seeing the benefit of demand for storage, both from our existing tenants who want to continue to use storage in this environment, as Joe mentioned, for many reasons, as well as new customers that are seeking new space."

So part of the flexibility, for instance, if you look at the Bay Area that many tech workers have been given is when a big employer, many of whom you -- anyone of us can point to, gives signals and/or time frames where they may not be pulling their employees back, not for 1 or 2 months, but for 6 months to a year, coupled with giving them full flexibility to be somewhere else. That could vary. So some employees will still come back. There's no question about that, but it may be for several months or several quarters, depending again on the unknown timing of the pandemic itself.
And then to what degree these become permanent relocations and then some commensurate impact on the need to keep goods or whatever they're keeping in one of our units in that particular market will be a question. And we can predict it. I don't know. Fortunately, again, if you look at the Bay Area, for instance, we have an opportunity to stand out there because we've got a very well-placed portfolio. It's very difficult to add new supply there. So the inherent need for that space in that market long term is quite high. There's no question about it. And it's difficult to build there. So it's not a market by any means that we're concerned about from an oversupply standpoint, et cetera.
This has just been a very unusual environment where this demand has been so elevated, where I mentioned we've got system-high occupancies of 97%, 98% this time of year. I mean we have never seen that before. So it's to be determined. It's hard to predict. And the flexibility and the way in which employees, whether they're tech-oriented or other traditional office users, change over time is to be determined. But Tom mentioned, we're seeing -- it's just not in these urban or more dense markets. We're seeing healthy demand across the entire system. We frankly don't have a market that's down in occupancy. It continues to percolate our lease-up of our newly built and our acquired assets is very strong. And consumer demand continues to be very, very active, particularly for this time a year."

The thing that I didn't mention about the portfolio that we'll be closing this quarter is the occupancy is about 35%. We look at that as a very good thing relative to, again, the opportunity to lease up space based on the demand factors that we're seeing, the great locations that these assets are tied to and the quality of the assets.
So it's a very good opportunity for us to stabilize those assets to put our own marketing and operational tactics and strategies into them. And we feel that we'll have very good returns once we get the assets stabilized. As you well know, that can take anywhere from 3 to 4 years on a normalized basis, not only once you get to stabilized occupancy, but more stabilized revenue and pricing metrics. So we'll continue to look for, again, the stabilization of those assets. But as I mentioned, pretty high-quality, good, solid assets and adds.

I think we've spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward, and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating",416,"Sure, Ki Bin, it's Tom. I think we've spent some time talking last quarter around the cumulative impact of the pandemic, which was likely to continue to impact revenue growth trends as we move forward, and we did see that into the third quarter. Operating metrics have removed more quickly than financial metrics, and we -- let's pick a part of the occupancy and rate equation. I commented earlier around how occupancy trends have improved with a combination of better top-of-funnel activity as well as lower move-out volumes. And so that's improved occupancy trends. In many of our markets, we have reached occupancies that are frictional, meaning we are at 97%, 98% occupancy in the middle of the month, which is frictional in our industry. So it's a matter of what play through with rate in some of those markets as we move forward.
As you just highlighted and we spoke about earlier, existing tenant rate increases are not going to be a contributing factor to improving rent trends, given the magnitude of the increases are likely to be lower as we move forward through the fourth quarter. That said, just looking at in-place rents from June 30 -- at June 30, in-place rents were down 3.1%, and we finished the quarter September 30, down 1.8%. And with existing tenants not contributing to that improvement, that negative impact was more than offset by improved customer activity and the reduction of rent roll down. If you look at the third quarter of 2019, rent roll down was about 15%. And as we moved into the third quarter of 2020, that narrowed down to about 4%. So improved rent roll down more than offsetting the degradation from existing tenant rate increase drag in the quarter.
Looking forward, aggregate contract rents recovered. So occupancy and rent combined to positive 20 basis points at September 30, and we've continued to see good customer trends through October. So better rental income trends. Fees, which have been a negative contributor to revenue growth in both the second and third quarters, we anticipate to continue to do so as we move forward, and that's really driven by customers paying their rent, which is a great thing but is a degradation in revenue and the growth. So I think we spoke a little bit about that on the last call, Ki Bin, but we continue to see that, and we'd anticipate that through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year."

So throughout this year, we redeemed about $1.2 billion of preferred. We haven't issued quite that much yet, and we were active in the bond market in Europe in January. Financing markets, as Joe highlighted earlier, are as attractive as they have ever been. Preferreds are sub-4% for us today, which is a record low, which presents that opportunity, and we have great access to debt capital, too. As we said in previous settings, we'll look to utilize both preferreds and debt for incremental financing activity as we move through 2021 for both preferred refinancing as well as for potential acquisition opportunities and development funding, which clearly, as Joe highlighted earlier, is accelerating as we move through the fourth quarter. So good access to capital and we'll utilize both, and we hope that we have the opportunity to refinance in 2021 like we did in 2020 and 2019."

Just trying to understand, obviously, looking at the analysis, just looking for sort of more thematic in terms of, is there anything that stands out in terms of the demand driver in this period, whether it be college students, small businesses, work-from-home or just people leaving the city. And the reason I asked that is, one of the questions we get a lot is, presumably, once the vaccine is here and it normalizes, really trying to get at which drivers are going to stay and stick around and which drivers were really just sort of a one timer. And maybe what new demand drivers we may not be thinking about, again, once we normalize."

Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or they're going to shift up and do",426,"Yes. Ron, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to track as these different demand factors play through. It's hard to predict the sustainability or the likelihood that some of them are here permanently or they're going to shift up and down. I already talked a little bit about the work-from-home demand factor. That's clearly new at this level of magnitude. And whether or not that sustains from a demand standpoint after the pandemic settles down or not is to be determined. Many companies are looking at work-from-home platforms as a different and new way of enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction, but the theoretical argument against that is there may be the opposite playing through, too. So it's a little bit hard to predict. And at the moment, we're just going to continue to survey and understand and see these drivers.
But the interesting thing is they're all additive, and they're continuing to drive, as we've talked about, very optimized performance. We'll continue to learn from this, and it's brought, frankly, a healthy and new set of customers into the storage sector who never used the product before. So I think long term, that's a good thing. The adoption of the product continues to grow statistically. And it, once again, is proving that the product is highly resilient, it's highly adaptable and consumers like it. The things that we continue to do also are find ways of making the customer interaction that much more effective, making it a much more easy decision and transaction. So many of the tools that we've been putting into our technological channels and options for customers are serving us well.
About 40-plus percent of our move-in volume in the third quarter came from our e-rental platform that, frankly, was in test mode before the pandemic, came about, but statistically, we moved in 115,000 customers directly through that a channel. And that transaction takes about 5 minutes, and consumers love it. And that's not just because of the pandemic. It's just a great and easy way to capture a storage unit. So we've got different things that we're also able to test in a very challenging environment like this that are frankly giving us even new and different tools that could lead to different levels of dealing with customers in a very different way than we were doing before that, again, are very aligned with their ability to think even more positively about needing a storage facility because it's that much easier to capture and it's that much more cost effective."

Just trying to get sort of harder numbers and quantifying it. Clearly, you have cost of capital. You talked about sort of the pipeline deals that you've identified of at least $700 million. The question is, is there -- just for PSA, when you sort of take a step back and look at your team, is there $500 million, $1 billion, maybe even more of acquisition opportunities out there for the company a year? Or just trying to understand what's the mitigating factor? Is there not enough sellers? Is it too competitive? But if the company decided tomorrow to take acquisitions up, what would be the mitigating factor to getting to a number like that?"

We have very disciplined analytics that we use that give us the right guidepost to say, ""These are the relative and I would say, better timed opportunities to deploy capital."" This is, at the moment, a good window to do that. Our cost of capital, as Tom reiterated, is very, very good. Our access to capital is very good. We know most of the markets that we operate in much better than others do. So we have different ways for us to step back and understand the relative ultimate capital allocation performance and ability to drive value through, not only our acquisition environment, but our development and redevelopment activities.
So we have all those tools, we continue to analyze them. And we've got a balance sheet that can clearly accommodate multiple factors of the volume that we're even talking about this quarter. So I don't see that as any way a limiter, and we're going to continue to evaluate the timing and the quality and the fit of any particular acquisition, whether it's a one-off, whether it's a medium-sized portfolio or a sizable one."

I think we've also highlighted that we have capacity to utilize that balance sheet in times like this to fund acquisitions, and we're doing that in the second half of this year. So we definitely have some capacity from here to add incremental leverage. And we're doing that as we move forward.
In terms of the appropriate amount of leverage, we think a conservative long-term view and a single A rating is an appropriate place for a REIT of our size, scale and capability."

But what we've learned certainly through this experience is that everyone is unique.
And so our ability to point to that is what will happen when the pandemic eases, I think, is limited, and we're going to be certainly watching very closely in terms of what consumer activity will be like as we move through future quarters. And I would say it's unpredictable. And it's unpredictable because of the health care nature of this crisis as well as the government activities to reduce the spread of the virus.

The length of stays were extending last year, and we started to get the beneficial impact of sending more rental rate increases last year. And as we moved into the second half of this year, with the decreased move-outs, more customers have been eligible for rental rate increases this year. And if this continues, would anticipate that in the beginning of next year as well.

So I'll provide a little bit more color around customer collections in aggregate because that is the primary reason why fees are down. And so as we look at rent collections, really starting in the second quarter and persisting through the third have been very solid. And some of the things you highlighted are contributing, i.e., auto pay is at a modestly higher percentage. But even away from auto pay tenants, customer payment patterns have accelerated, and we're charging less in terms of fees. And so obviously, if you don't charge it, you're not going to collect it.
Our receivables have been down around 30% through the quarter, and that's persisted through the delinquency period for tenants, meaning that receivables are down about 30%. We wrote off about 30% less rent. We had about 30% fewer auctions in the quarter. So overall customer health and payment patterns have improved, and that has led to lower fees, primarily from late fees, which are charged for customers not paying their rent within a grace period, but also contributed from longer into the delinquency period, lean fees and lean sale fees, but primarily driven by the grace period ending late fee in the first month of a customer's delinquency."

Some of that has been put in the rearview mirror. The trends have continued. It's something we're watching very closely month-over-month. I would tell you that trends continued through October, and payment patterns have been very good through the early part of November as well. So it feels like at least for the foreseeable future or near to medium term, we're anticipating that will be the case, but we're watching it very closely."
