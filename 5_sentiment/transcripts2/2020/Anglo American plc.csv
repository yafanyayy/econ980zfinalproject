It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the",470,"Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the presentation. 
And firstly, as an enterprise, we have a very clear purpose, which is to reengineer mining to improve people's lives, improve people's lives, all people, our employees and contractors who work in our organizations, but also all of our other stakeholders, and including, of course, the billions of people who live on this planet and who go about their daily lives. Consuming directly and indirectly a lot of the products that we make available. Now there are a lot of things that we need to concentrate on to improve in order to live that purpose. But there is one screamingly obvious one, of course, and that is our target of 0 harm for the employees and contractors who work for us day in, day out. 
And as you're going to hear from Mark shortly, very unfortunately, last year, 4 of our employees, stroke contractors lost their lives going about their work in our managed operations. And Mark will give you some more detail beyond that. That's tough, right? Now that is the best-ever performance, but that is scant comfort for the families of those four. And I think that what's really important is to understand that improve people's lives when you ended [ 4 ] is a constant vigil. 
Now what comfort can we take? We can take comfort from the fact that, again, last year, year-on-year, we improved the important underlying safety measures of performance that we have on a kind of historic basis. So that's good news. And secondly, the work streams, all of the work streams of the elimination of fatalities task force that was kicked off in earnest about 18 months ago, properly in earnest to redouble our efforts have all progressed really, really well. So we're happy we're doing the right things. We're happy we're on the path but we have got a long way to go. And please be assured that the Board of the company, of Anglo American are very serious about this. 
The second and last subject I wanted to cover was since July, when I presented last time, we've had 2 more Board changes. And I just want you to join me in welcoming our 2 new nonexecutive directors to the Board, both from South Africa, Hixonia Nyasulu, who joined in November of last year; and Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who joined last month. So welcome to them. Other than that, the Board is as it was. 
Let me now hand over to Mark and Stephen, and initially, Mark, to take us through last year."

I'm a Chelsea supporter. So we haven't spoken much during the course of this week. 
Ladies and gentlemen, what I'd like to do is just point you to, you each have one of these on your chairs, which is what to do in the case of an emergency. There are no drills scheduled for this morning, so you shouldn't one hope need. But in the event we do, can you make sure you've got that in your hand and follow the processes that have been outlined. Very important. Thank you. 
Again, just for me to acknowledge colleagues, Stuart, thank you for the opening. Colleagues, please take the opportunity to talk to people. I know some of you already have this morning. Most importantly, we have Chris Griffith with us today. Chris is flying in from South Africa overnight. As you are aware, Chris informed all of us of his intention to step down. And what I would like to say and acknowledge Chris for the wonderful contribution he's made to Anglo American over the last 30 years. 
And if I could make a special observation consistent with the Chairman's observation. For the first time in our history in the PGMs business, 0 fatality in our operations. And for those that understand, we are still a deep underground miner. It's a remarkable achievement. And from me, Chris, congratulations. 
We also have announced this morning or Anglo platinum has announced this morning the appointment of Natasha Velan to replace Chris. Natasha is with us this morning. So welcome, Natacha. Big boots to fill, but we've known Natasha for about almost 6 years now at Anglo, and she's made a tremendous contribution in her time in the group and looking forward to the contribution that she will make in terms of the future of the business. I believe [ Timber Macronase ] is going to be here, but I haven't seen him yet, but just to let you know that he should be here. And we also have Tom [ McColli ]. Tom, can you put your hand up. Tom, is the leader on the [ Cay Vayco ] project. He gave the briefing to the board this week, and certainly, from our perspective, thrilled with the progress that's being made. And again, if you've got a minute, but I'm sure Tom would love to tell you about each project. He certainly gave the Board and the executive a great summary of where we're up to and very pleasing where it's up to as we stand today. 
To yourselves. Thank you for joining us. It's been another important year for Anglo American. It's been a solid year in terms of results as we continue to build on the foundations that we've created over the last few years. We do see continuing upside. And obviously, the focus in how do we continue to maintain the rate, if you like, or the momentum that we've created. The P101 and our other operations improvement work is very important to us. We are not yet best of the best. We have improved our competitive position significantly, but there's a lot more we can do, and we remain focused on doing that work. And consistent with that is our improvement in safety, and those 2 pieces go hand-in-hand. 
Our broader technical changes that we introduced in the business has certainly had a big impact, and there's more we can do. And our marketing innovation work is something that doesn't get a lot of airplay that has been significant. And certainly, as you see, a number of our major competitors starting to restructure their marketing business and almost duplicating what we've put in place, it certainly says a lot, Peter and the team, in terms of the work they've done. 
I will talk about FutureSmart a little bit later in my presentation. But again, a lot of people talking about technical innovation and getting the engine room working. And certainly, I think we're hearing a lot of terms that we've been using for a number of years now being thrown around in different parts of the industry. 
And our portfolio enhancement project, we remain committed to disciplined capital, a balanced approach to investments in the business to ensure that we continue to improve margins and returns. And from our point of view, we think that is the key to ensuring that we retain a consistent improvement in our performance over the longer haul. 
Good news and the bad news, diamond, tough, PGMs, great year. The beauty of being a diversified miner is quality of the assets that we're able to maintain and develop in the portfolio and the exposure we have to different markets. And again, that strength comes through in what has been a tough year in a couple of commodities, thermal coal, diamonds, but in PGMs iron ore across the board. I think we saw a 2% improvement in price over the course of the year, with a 9% improvement in performance, which is pointing to both the quality of the portfolio or the diversity of the portfolio and the quality of the assets. 
And then finally, our offer for Sirius is in place. Under takeover rules, I won't be able to say more than I've already said. I will make a few comments. But again, I will be consistent, and we'll be happy to take questions. But as you would expect, we are somewhat constrained in what we can say. And I think people are probably a little bit disappointed in terms of the questions they've asked and what I've said in response to those questions. Nothing new here in terms of our conversations. But I think I should make the point that for us, it's not inconsistent with our strategy. In fact, we think it's absolutely consistent, which is about focus on quality, focus on driving margins and returns over the long term and having a key -- with potentially another great asset to follow that in terms of development works well with all of the things that we've been talking to over the last 5 or 6 years. 
Stephen, can I have the clicker? Yes, sorry. So just to roll through on the agenda. I've gone personally dinner already. Just quickly, I'll do the transformation journey. Stephen will pick up the financials and talk to the numbers, the important bit. I'll talk to the growth and our approach going forward. And then how we see ourselves positioned in the future. And I hope continue to help people understand how we see ourselves differentiating in the industry in which we work. 
Again, on the results, margins effectiveness. And we -- when we talk about the business, we talk about measuring performance in 3 streams: firstly, effectiveness as a team, our job, our success is ultimately measured on the cash flow that we deliver from the business. And it's all about cash flow. We do talk to free cash flow, and we talk to sustainable free cash flow, which is cash flow before growth projects. So from our point of view, making sure we've got the balance but it's about generating cash flow, and that's our effectiveness measure, and we continue to improve the underlying business. Measuring the efficiency of those cash flows is our capital return measure, which is return on capital employed, and there are different capital return measures. Each of you use your run. But for us, it's about making sure we're focused on working every dollar as hard as we can, and our threshold return is 15%. Now you'll see this year that we've delivered 19%, which is above the threshold. But we look at those 2 numbers together to understand how well we're doing as a business. Because at the end of the day, if you're not delivering 15%, then you're starting to get close to value destruction, which at the end of the day means you don't and you're not creating a sustainable business. 
And then finally, sustainability has a number of mentions that we talk to, starting from safety, environment, developing people, social performance, right the way through to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. And for us, looking at those pillars, is as much about the first 2 numbers is making sure that we can deliver those results sustainably. And when we talk about capital allocation, it's about making sure we've got those 3 elements all heading in the same direction. In simple terms, we focus about -- we focus on getting those 3 dimensions right, and that's certainly where we've been from where we started in terms of the transformation journey. 
So to start with some key elements of that sustainability conversation, as Stuart pointed out, we've lost 4 colleagues in the year. And despite it being the best-ever safety performance that we've delivered, now you're as a good year if you've lost a colleague. The elimination of fatalities work is absolutely key to the improvements and ultimately, delivering on that promise of 0 harm, but it also touches all other elements of the business. Health in our industry, quite frankly, has been an even more difficult issue and a bigger killer, the natural safety incidents over the long term. And I'm proud to say, and if you look back at around 2007, we lost over 600 colleagues to HIV stroke age-related illnesses. For the first time in the last 30-odd years, the number last year was 0. And that's a remarkable achievement, and it speaks to the lead that Anglo American took in South Africa and on a global basis in working with its employees and helping people understand what we could do to make a difference, including the first company, first major company that actually provided antiretroviral drugs to employees and their families. And for us, that achievement is as significant as anything we've done, and it speaks to who we are as a company and very much that purpose conversation that Stuart was talking to. It's one thing to talk about a purpose. It's another thing to live it. And we're certainly focused on living it. 
On environment, we continue to improve. I think the environmental performance reflects the focus on planning, understanding risk and making sure we control those risks. We've still got a lot of work to do within the operations, but in many ways, it's a metaphor for the focus the operating model brings and the focus on planning and making sure we're executing the work effectively. 
In terms of transformation, yes, we are a fundamentally transformed business. If you look at where we've come from, you know, most of you know the story. We have focused on the portfolio. Half the assets, we've still grown production by 12% over that period. The thing that's driven that is the technical changes that we've introduced in the assets that we've kept. And the underlying efficiency improvements. So the average production from the assets we've retained is 30% higher from where we were back in 2012, '13. As a consequence, our operating cost in real terms have dropped 45% or 29% in nominal terms. And from our perspective, the real challenge going forward is to keep the lead on costs so that we deliver flat or better costs over time. And if we can continue to do that effectively, then we certainly believe margins and returns will continue to grow. And you will see in forecasting forward, where we talk about growing our margins from 40% to 45% to 45% to 50%, the difference in those 2 numbers is that current prices, we can grow to 45% to 50%, 
[Technical Difficulty] 
with the focus on operating improvement in efficiencies through the productivity, doubling of productivity, we've continued to improve our competitive position, which reflects the transformation, and the quicker improvement 
[Technical Difficulty] 
is based on revenue. So we try and get the weighted mix right, and we do that when we measure against our competitors, and the data is externally sourced. So we think it's objective. And today, or last year, based on the -- especially in the first half, we're at 36 percentile. We still haven't got the final [ year ] numbers in. But based on what we've seen, we will probably improve a little bit more, but others may also move. So we'll wait and see where the numbers led. But we still remain from what we can see on the frontage of our competitive position and with the diversity of the portfolio, I think we add another dimension that others don't have in terms of thinking about returns and positioning going forward. 
Consistent with that, we've also done a lot of work on the marketing side. So despite the commodity price, and that red squiggly line is our basket price over time has actually dropped 5% in gross terms. So our growth in margins from 30% to 40% reflects the cost improvements that we've delivered and with better prices realized for many of our products. We've actually still grown our margins. And again, that's the test of resilience, we call it, in terms of your competitive position and what we can do with mergers, and there's still more we can do. 
So with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Otherwise, I would have been the [indiscernible], I'm sure. Listen, good morning, and welcome to everyone. There's 3 key themes that I really want to talk you through this morning before I get stacking in the numbers. So it's about continuing delivery, and that's really built off the operating model and the productivity that Mark loves to talk to. It's about the increasing margin. So it's realizing the value from that productivity and dropping that to the bottom line. And then also, it's about the disciplined allocation of cash. So it's about the balance, getting the balance sheet right; allocating capital for the existing business; returns to shareholders; and then obviously, setting us up to deliver the next wave of disciplined growth. 
So turning to the numbers themselves. EBITDA, up 9%. What you see in the numbers, as Mark mentioned, is the benefit of owning quality assets and the diversification across the portfolio. So we had strong iron ore prices and PGM prices offsetting the weakness in the diamond midstream and coal prices; the 6% reduction in costs, despite the headwinds that we've encountered, and I'll talk about those in a moment; and as Mark mentioned, again, some great work from the marketing team. 
EPS, up 8% to $2.75 a share. That drove the 40% payout ratio and a dividend of $1.09 per share. In addition, you'll be aware, we announced the USD 1 billion buyback at the half year, and we've progressed that through since then. So CapEx of $3.8 billion and up a little this year with the contribution to [ Cayveco ], and obviously, also progress in aquila met coal operations and the diamond vessel that we're building for Namibia. So with that, they're up a little bit as expected to $4.6 billion. 
So $10 billion of EBITDA, and we'll do a quick tour around the 4 business units. So diamonds, first of all, as Mark mentioned, the tough year, excess polished inventories in the midstream, some macro uncertainty and also some localized regional events. As a market leader to be responded, cut production and provided some relief in terms of pricing. 
Copper, a really solid plant performance, offsetting some of the water challenges at Los Bronces and then an excellent cost position overall, with C1 costs coming down to $1.26 across the year. 
In PGMs, as I said, EBITDA nearly doubled, significant increase in the basket price. Palladium and rhodium prices have continued in -- to improve into 2020. And that was, as well, we had about 100,000 [indiscernible] rollover from '18 to '19, given some of the load shedding that occurred late in the year. Now we did these calculations, I think, about mid day yesterday, so you have to excuse me. They're probably significantly out of date by the time we speak this morning. So with spot prices, clearly, our margin continues to improve well in excess of 50%, given the basket price is now well in excess of $4,500 per [ tonne an ounce ]. 
Just to give you a sense of the numbers here, that would translate to about $2 billion of platinum revenue, although I noticed that's up significantly overnight, a $4 billion of palladium revenue and about $3.5 billion of rhodium revenue. So you can see the extent those price moves are going to have in terms of cash flow should that continue. 
In terms of bulks, we benefit from record production at Minas-Rio. At Minas-Rio, a really great performance again from the team, and Kumba recovered through the second half. 
Met coal, great margins there at 43% across the portfolio. Again, a number of moving parts, good iron ore prices, but softer coal, particularly [ Serahan ] reduced production given the weaker European markets.  
So let's have a look at what drives those numbers. So if we work from the left-hand side across to the right. So in terms of macro or external factors, broadly in line year-to-year. So currency, CPI and price, broadly offset one another. 
We've also just pulled out for you there the impact of Diamond's demand that had in terms of the underlying EBITDA. So that's the buildup in the midstream and the combination of lower index prices and the lower quality mix of diamonds, and therefore, the lower volumes that De Beers put into the marketplace. 
The last couple of slides, we have seen some early signs of recovery, but I would stress it's early. And obviously, the coronavirus provides some uncertainty just as we go through the first half of this year. 
On the controllable side, a decent improvement, $600 million in all, largely driven by the Minas-Rio recovery versus the 2017 production, and we also had a $0.4 [ billion ] of other cost and volume benefits, but they were offset to provide a net $0.1 billion, given the water at Los Bronces for load shedding in PGMs and the loss of the domestic sales towards the end of the year in Kumba. 
Turning to the balance sheet. You can just follow the page. Turning to the balance sheet. Again, I'm going to really reiterate some of the messages that we've been speaking really consistently about over the last couple of years. So it's about balance, it's about balance sheet strength and discipline so that we can consistently deliver period after period and also drive some of those value-adding growth opportunities over time. Net debt was up, as expected, Cayoveco stepped up, in total, $1.3 billion for the year. And also, we had the change in IFRS standards accounting, which brought about $0.5 billion of leases onto the balance sheet. 
Just to point out as well that 4.6 does include  about $300 million of [ Mitsubishi ] debt that we consolidate onto our balance sheet given the control. 
The 2 other balance sheet metrics are really important, the 0.5 net debt-to-EBITDA, very comfortable, well within our guidance and net gearing at a very healthy 13%. Again, a real commitment to ongoing capital discipline so that we do provide that flexibility in the balance sheet should we need it. 
A key part of our thinking is clearly returns to shareholders. Dividend policy of 40% payout resulted in the dividends this year, $1.4 billion in total paid, an average yield of 5% across 2019. This was supplemented by a $1 billion buyback program that we announced at the half year. As of today, we're about $950 million roughly through that buyback program. And consistent with our disclosure, we'd expect to complete that by the end of March. 
Our 40% payout policy will continue through 2020 and '21. As per our normal considerations, if we were to generate extra cash, we will run that through our normal capital allocation considerations. Part of those considerations is that we would always assess whether we would return excess cash to shareholders through either a buyback or special dividend. There's no change in that respect. 
So how did we go in terms of that capital allocation framework across the year? We generated sustainable free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year. We have spoken about net debt, and as I say, very pleased with where we are on the balance sheet. We started to allocate more capital to discretionary options because we have got the balance sheet to where we wanted to get it. So that was the $1 billion in terms of the buyback, at which, by December, we'd spent $900 million and then $1.1 billion in terms of gross spend. And I should be aware, the majority of that in terms of the Cayoveco project. So really, we think where we've got that again, balanced approach to how we're thinking about capital allocation and cash flow. Just to be clear, too, you'll see on that bottom left-hand side, the Sirius would be part of our consideration in terms of how we allocate discretionary cash flow. So very clearly part of our thinking in terms of portfolio upgrade. 
So looking forward, in terms of CapEx, effectively, the same guidance that we gave you back in December. There's a step-up in CapEx for 2020 as we hit peak CapEx year for [ Cayoveco ]. The numbers there do we exclude anything in terms of Sirius? Obviously, still subject to the ongoing offer. Serious had indicated, and we are comfortable that with their proposed [ $0.3 ] billion over the next 2 years as part of their revised development schedule. Importantly, that would mean we're not really focused on heavy cash flow on 2 greenfield projects at the same time that would nicely sequence itself post Cayoveco spin. 
So also looking forward in terms of our $3 billion to $4 billion target. So we set that target just as a reminder from the start of '18 through to the end of '22. And as we've consistently said, some of that will be back-end weighted as we deliver particularly the tech dev and the projects. To date, we've delivered $0.5 billion. We're comfortable that our improvement run rate that we're seeing and our equipment performance is in excess of that. Some of that will come through over time as it gets released from working capital and flows through the system. And some of it in this second half, in particular, has been taken up a little bit by some of those headwinds that I spoke about, water, load shedding, et cetera. But it's our job to make sure that we give that value visibility and getting all parts of our business to operate at those same run rates, so that we see that value drop to the bottom line. 
For 2020, we've identified further improvements of $0.4 billion. No pressure, Natasha, but partly driven by improved performance in the smelting and refining at Kumba -- sorry, at PGMs and a little bit of a turnaround in consistency of performance at Kumba. Remember, they had a few maintenance issues early last year. We have seen no -- as most of you would be aware, we had a roof collapse at Moranbah in January. Importantly, no one was hurt in that process. So the team did a great job. We were in the middle of a longwall move, and that will now take us about 8 weeks longer than what was originally planned. So we will lose around 2 million tonnes of production for Moranbah. However, we will try to make some of that up from [ Garovla ]. And obviously, we've got the balance of the year to really try to outperform to get that back. That results in about a $0.2 billion impact on EBITDA. 
And you'll notice, if you've had a chance to look at the guidance, we've adjusted our guidance on met coal production for the year by about that sum. So looking at the 3 categories. Again, operating model P101, strong performance but partly offset. The tech dev, we continue to work on program. We're rolling out the initiative. The benefits will largely come through in '21 and '22. And again, just to give you a flavor of that, the [ Orso ] [indiscernible] is in and running. I think it's the second half this year as the ore processing -- sorry, the, of course, particle flotation circuit will be in. And then we're also putting in the ore sorters at [indiscernible] as we speak. So you should start to see some of those benefits flow through. Mark will touch on the growth projects in a moment, but all on time and on budget, and they obviously contribute, to I've said, towards the end of that '22 period. 
So just before I hand back to Mark, once again, fully committed to the balanced approach of running a strong balance sheet, flexibility through the cycle so that we can focus and create on long-term value for not only our shareholders, but all of our stakeholders. We'll continue with attractive returns and balance as we think about those returns to shareholders as we try to look after both today's cash flow and the generation of tomorrow's cash flows. So a disciplined, value-adding approach. 
Mark mentioned the long-term EBITDA margin target, so I won't go into that again. But we do believe that we've got some upside still to flow through that as we deliver those underlying improvements in the business so that we get an increased sustainable margin, both at spot prices and that long-term consensus pricing. 
Mark, back to you."

They've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier lead. So for those, other words [indiscernible], you can commiserate. 
Disciplined growth. So where to next? The first point I'd like to make in the conversation around the growth, it's not simply about top line growth. When we talk growth, it's about growing value. And so for us, it's growing top line revenues, and it's about growing margins in particular. And so for us, growth is about growing cash flow and growing returns. And I obviously touched something there. There we go. 
So for us, it's about sustainable free cash flow and returns, and that's really the key part of our focus. Well, that's really where the focus is for us as a group. 
Okay. In terms of projects, Cayveco, doing well on time, on budget, very pleased with the progress we've seen. And again, I'd invite you to have a quick chat to Tom while he's here. Again, the complexities, and there are clinical complexities in all of the jurisdictions that the mining industry operate, but I think we've navigated those extremely well. And the local community relationships are exceptional. And for Peru, if you can get those relationships right, it's a key to being successful in the country. And so I think the team has done a good job, and we're very pleased with the progress so far. 
In terms of De Beers, with the new boat going -- is it a ship or a boat, Bruce? It's a ship. Stuart is going to kick me for even asking the question. Very happy with the progress, and the team has done a great job in working with the manufacturers, and they're doing very well in time. Just to remind you, the quality of the diamonds from the marine projects is very high. It's around $500 a carat. And so it really does add quality and margin again to the De Beers work and a very important one for us. At colo met coal, going very well, decline, a pretty straightforward operation, but an important one that picks up where Grasstree will finish off with its life. So very pleased with progress right across the board. And certainly, a 2-part growth engine seems to be going very well. And we've got a number of things still to come through Moranbah-Grosvenor that Stephen's talked about. 
In terms of Sirius, I will stick closer to my script. It is a quality asset. We've talked about the polyhalite resource being a very different type of product, multi-nutrient, low chloride, low cost. It's a product that will travel. And certainly, the feedback we've had when we've done our due diligence work has been very positive. And in particular, the form that the product comes in is very important in terms of the value proposition. So we think it has good potential. Obviously, there's still a lot more work to do. And taking all those factors into account, we think the offer that we have is fair and reasonable, and it's taken all of those issues into proper account. 
The only other point I would make is we still have a way to go. There still is a vote from shareholders required. And all we ask is that shareholders take note of the Chairman statement in the documentation regarding their recommendation in terms of the Anglo offer. And so from our perspective, it's a work in progress, still a long way to go. And again, we encourage those shareholders to look at the statement from the Chairman and the directors in terms of the Anglo proposition that is currently sitting before them. 
In terms of the future and how we think about the business, it is very much about quality assets. And again, our conversation around Sirius fits into that conversation, as we do see there's a potential Tier 1 asset. And for us, we think that our focus in terms of what we've been doing with the portfolio, with the portfolio on a broader basis is consistent with those themes. We are continuing to shape the portfolio on the basis of a quality asset in markets that we think have potential strong pricing fundamentals. And from out perspective, something that we understand and we believe we can do well in. 
Our business model and the way we invest across the value chain is fundamentally different to our competitors. Our business model is a very different business model to a trading model or a logistics model. It is about understanding what we do from mine through to customer and consumer and making sure that we're investing in leverage points across the value chain. And that is a different approach. That approach has been absolutely clear as a bell, obviously, in De Beers. But our investment in platinum and the profile we've taken in the PGM industry is unique as well. And the work on venture capital in helping promote uses of platinum and other materials in terms of the hydrogen economy is how we differentiate ourselves in the way we think about our business and the models we're creating. 
In terms of FutureSmart mining, when we talk about carbon neutrality or we talk about the way the mining industry needs to look in 5, 10, 20 years, we've been in a strategic conversation for 6 years. FutureSmart mining is about changing the way mining is carried out, so that we can ultimately get to carbon neutrality that we can ultimately reduce our footprint and connect ourselves to local community in a very different way compared to what we've done as an industry in the past. Our regional collaborative development model is unique. [ Gemfire ], working with our digital miners and government to change the nature of mining is strategic. It's different. And we understand, in some cases, people struggle with some of the things we're doing. But as each day goes by, what we're doing makes more sense to those that talk ESG. It's not about talking, it's about walking. And we're proud to say that in the last 3 or 4 weeks with the publishing of the responsibility index, which is work versus talk, we've come up as the top resources company. Now the challenge is to continue working and leading the industry and the changes that we've talked to. And those conversations will lead us and those approaches will lead us in terms of how we profile the business in terms of scope 1, scope 2, scope 3 positions. But anything we talk to, any target we set will be based on the way we believe we should be transforming the business. It will have substance behind it. That's an important point. And for us, FutureSmart is the substance behind the conversation, and we've been there for 6 years. And putting all those pieces together, it's about people. We've built and developed, we think, an exceptional team across the business. We continue to evolve the business. And from our perspective, it's about people and about making sure we've got the right people in the right rose. And so we believe that, that will always be a work in progress, but it is again a defining position for us in the industry. 
On asset portfolio, again, Stephen, I think, said it well, a clip on diamonds and in PGMs, we are industry leaders. We take that leadership role seriously in terms of the way we talk to our industry, the way we talk to our products, the way we interface with both customers and consumers, and we understand the difference between the 2 and how we're developing our business for the longer term. Clearly, Bruce and his team are doing a lot of work in rethinking and reimagining the way Diamond should be taken forward. And we're looking at every part of the value chain in terms of how it can make a more significant contribution in driving long-term value. Very important piece for us. And Chris has done the same in the PGM industry. 
Our high-quality bulks are unique in terms of quality. And for us, we've been positioning in that business the way we have for some years. We've taken [ combes ] product from [ about ] 62%, 63% to 64.5% on the basis that we believe the market will reward quality consistency and the relationship that we create in our markets and put that with our marketing work, again, a unique positioning in the industry. And with copper, nickel and other products we produce, again, a very much a future-facing portfolio, which we think is very much a differentiating factor in terms of the future and ultimately, we think future returns. 
Our investment proposition, again, is based on competitive assets, and you've seen our improvement in competitive position. We have built a differentiated set of capabilities. We've been thinking strategically from day 1 in terms of our transformation. How do we create a company that leads the industry and the way it thinks about how its services, society and delivers the products the right way and in a way that are valued by society in terms of what we bring to the conversation. And those footprints and the work we're doing is consistent with that differentiated set of capabilities. So a lot of people now are talking about focus on technical, focusing on operating capacities. We've been there for 6 years. And then finally, in terms of returns. When Stephen talks about balance, it is about discipline in capital allocation, investing in the right things and making sure the business is sustainable in every sense of the word. So whether it's a safety conversation or whether it's a growth conversation or whether it's a competitive cost position, it's all about building a sustainable [ bidders ]. By that, remain delivering sustainable returns and improving returns to our shareholders. 
So with that, Stephen and I would be thrilled to take your questions."

Stephen, you obviously gave us a nice sort of pie chart, and that is on a consolidated basis. But if you look at the ex South African net debt, that went up from about 8.5 million -- I can think of another 400 million, 500 million. So you are essentially buying back from debt. Could you give us an idea of the split just between how much you bought back in South Africa and in -- outside of South Africa? And obviously, you've said in the past, that does matter. I mean, with CapEx are rising, do you think it's -- there's room for more buybacks down the line? I mean, obviously, cash flow generation is very strong. A lot of that is in South Africa. So maybe just how you think about that? 
And then secondly, just on diamonds. You've obviously kept your guidance at 32 to 34. So that's roughly, let's say, 2 million to 3 million carats additional supply this year versus last year. You also have, let's say, $400 million or $500 million of inventory that you're looking to sell [ last ] year. Do you think, given the environment with the coronavirus and [ Russel ] are looking to destock by 4 million, 5 million carats, it's appropriate to still maintain that?

So I suppose we kept that fairly constant. 
Remembering also that we have the majority of those South African dollars held in U.S. dollars in London. And so at year-end, we actually had very limited local currency in South Africa. You'll see that we don't see the detail in the notes. So I'd have to say we're fairly comfortable. And practically, it doesn't have a big impact in terms of how we manage the cash."

I would argue that the Anglo American global story is just as exciting, but we've probably got a much broader pool that we're applying in. And over time, we've experienced those things tend to normalize out. So I think it's the normal ebb and flow we see in terms of differences. Our job at Anglo is to keep growing the business in terms of margins and cash flow. And where we were trading maybe at a 40% discount a year or 2 ago, we're at about 19% discount. If we keep closing that gap and deliver a 30-odd percent return to shareholders, at some point, people start switching their money on a broader basis. And our appeal to generalists, we think, is something that could quite materially change how people look at us. So we're focused on the big guide, the longer-term guide and the fact that we've got assets making a great contribution, it's a bigger story. Copper, the whole stories is, in our view, the main guy. Okay? 
Cayveco. Look, the guys are doing a good job on paper. We're doing extremely well. But I've been around this industry for 43 years. I've run major projects you can lose the gains very quickly. And so from our point of view, we'd like to see a little bit more time and finish off, we'd like to see the concrete finished in the mill, in particular, because we've still got, what, 60-odd thousand tonnes of concrete to place in the mill time. So before I start [indiscernible] and looking too excited, I'd like to see that done. So -- but we're making good progress. There is no doubt on the technical aspects, we're doing extremely well.

And if I could use the description, an automobile CEO won't get fired for spending $50 per [ car ] extra on PGM, but they might get fired for not meeting their emission targets. So the demand is real. We've seen increases in consumption per car, particularly in China, as they have tightened the limits. So these are real demand trends. The question for us is more around will there be some switching. Because don't forget, palladium is very important in terms of either heat source in the car, whereas platinum is more effective further down the process. So there's some technical questions. The real question is how long will the technical people take? And what can they do to maybe shift the use of platinum, palladium and rhodium around. Rhodium is used for a whole range of things. So the world is short rhodium clearly at the moment. And I'm not sure there's a lot more coming on in the near term. So it's in a pretty good position. Platinum, I still think will be a beneficiary, but it might take a little bit longer. 
In terms of Mahalow Quina, to get it into 2 parts, you've got 1/3 or a new concentrator, which would be certainly in the 1 billion to 1.5 billion type range, but you've also then got the technical type solutions where it might be all sorting and a whole range of incremental capital options that give you a far better return.

Again, just about capital discipline. We're not going to rush out, as Mark said, just because we have a high price today. We want to make the right long-term decisions in how we spend that capital. 
On the overall CapEx question, a couple of points to make. Obviously, as we deliver Cayveco, Moranbah-Grosvenor and brownfield, the new ship in Namibia, we'll be generating additional cash flows from all of those businesses as well as additional cash flows from the underlying business, given the improvements that we're focused on. So the business will be, I think, in quite a different place in the next couple of years. 
Could we have a sequence then of other capital projects without preempting any decision? Potentially so.

So how that plays out, we'll have to wait and see how markets develop. But potentially, we could have some internal options in front of us.

That would be a precursor to a broader commitment on hydrogen options for our off-truck, off-highway truck fleet. That's part of their whole carbon gas or decarbonization strategy.

I'd love to see that flow out, but ultimately, it will depend a little bit on market conditions just as to the time that, that may take. 
We also had a little bit of inventory build or not as much inventory run off as we would have liked in platinum. So again, some of that run down. It's a different mix between the 2. In De Beers, it's really held us finished goods ready to go. In platinum, it's held us largely as work-in-progress. So getting it through the last phases of the processing plant is really important in that part of the business. And so I'd love to say that perhaps come back towards normal levels again. 
On Los Bronces, I'm not sure I can add too much more to the guidance that we've given. We've given a production range. As Ruben said, that 6 20 to 6 70. That's really around water. So depending on how that plays out over the year, we'll have a reasonably good start and we're trying to recover as much water as we can to maximize the volume.

It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the presentation. 
And firstly, as an enterprise, we have a very clear purpose, which is to reengineer mining to improve people's lives, improve people's lives, all people, our employees and contractors who work in our organizations, but also all of our other stakeholders, and including, of course, the billions of people who live on this planet and who go about their daily lives, consuming directly and indirectly a lot of the products that we make available. Now there are a lot of things that we need to concentrate on to improve in order to live that purpose. But there is one screamingly obvious one, of course, and that is our target of zero harm for the employees and contractors who work for us day in, day out. 
And as you're going to hear from Mark shortly, very unfortunately, last year, 4 of our employees, stroke contractors lost their lives going about their work in our managed operations. And Mark will give you some more detail beyond that. That's tough, right? Now that is the best-ever performance, but that is scant comfort for the families of those 4. And I think that what's really important is to understand that improve people's lives when you ended 4 is a constant vigil. 
Now what comfort can we take? We can take comfort from the fact that, again, last year, year-on-year, we improved the important underlying safety measures of performance that we have on a kind of historic basis. So that's good news. And secondly, the work streams, all of the work streams of The Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce that was kicked off in earnest about 18 months ago, properly in earnest to redouble our efforts have all progressed really, really well. So we're happy we're doing the right things, we're happy we're on the path, but we have got a long way to go. And please be assured that the Board of the company, of Anglo American, are very serious about this. 
The second and last subject I wanted to cover was since July, when I presented last time, we've had 2 more Board changes. And I just want you to join me in welcoming our 2 new nonexecutive directors to the Board, both from South Africa, Hixonia Nyasulu, who joined in November of last year; and Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who joined last month. So welcome to them. Other than that, the Board is as it was. 
Let me now hand over to Mark and Stephen, and initially, Mark, to take us through last year."

Ladies and gentlemen, what I'd like to do is just point you to -- you each have one of these on your chairs, which is what to do in the case of an emergency. There are no drills scheduled for this morning, so you shouldn't one hope need. But in the event we do, can you make sure you've got that in your hand and follow the processes that have been outlined? Very important. Thank you. 
Again, just for me to acknowledge colleagues, Stuart, thank you for the opening. Colleagues, please take the opportunity to talk to people. I know some of you already have this morning. Most importantly, we have Chris Griffith with us today. Chris is flying in from South Africa rather night. As you are aware, Chris informed all of us of his intention to step down. And what I would like to say and acknowledge Chris for the wonderful contribution he's made to Anglo American over the last 30 years. 
And if I could make a special observation consistent with the Chairman's observation. For the first time in our history in the PGMs business, 0 fatality in our operations. And for those that understand, we are still a deep underground miner. It's a remarkable achievement. And from me, Chris, congratulations. 
We also have announced this morning -- or Anglo Platinum has announced this morning the appointment of Natascha Viljoen to replace Chris. Natascha is with us this morning. So welcome, Natascha. Big boots to fill, but we've known Natascha for about almost 6 years now at Anglo, and she's made a tremendous contribution in her time in the group and looking forward to the contribution that she will make in terms of the future of the business. 
I believe Themba Mkhwanazi is going to be here, but I haven't seen him yet, but just to let you know that he should be here. And we also have Tom McCulley. Tom, can you put your hand up? Tom is the leader on the Quellaveco project. He gave the briefing to the Board this week, and certainly, from our perspective, thrilled with the progress that's being made. And again, if you've got a minute, but I'm sure Tom would love to tell you about his project. He certainly gave the Board and the executive a great summary of where we're up to and very pleasing where it's up to as we stand today. 
To yourselves, thank you for joining us. It's been another important year for Anglo American. It's been a solid year in terms of results as we continue to build on the foundations that we've created over the last few years. We do see continuing upside and obviously the focus in how do we continue to maintain the rate, if you like, or the momentum that we've created. The P101 and  our other operations improvement work is very important to us. We are not yet best of the best. We have improved our competitive position significantly, but there's a lot more we can do, and we remain focused on doing that work. And consistent with that is our improvement in safety, and those 2 pieces go hand-in-hand. 
Our broader technical changes that we introduced in the business has certainly had a big impact, and there's more we can do. And our marketing innovation work is something that doesn't get a lot of airplay that has been significant. And certainly, as you see, a number of our major competitors starting to restructure their marketing business and almost duplicating what we've put in place, it certainly says a lot, but Peter and the team, in terms of the work they've done. 
I will talk about FutureSmart a little bit later in my presentation. But again, a lot of people talking about technical innovation and getting the engine room working. And certainly, I think we're hearing a lot of terms that we've been using for a number of years now being thrown around in different parts of the industry. 
And our portfolio enhancement project, we remain committed to disciplined capital, a balanced approach to investments in the business to ensure that we continue to improve margins and returns. And from our point of view, we think that is the key to ensuring that we retain a consistent improvement in our performance over the longer haul. 
Good news and the bad news, diamond, tough; PGMs, great year. The beauty of being a diversified miner is quality of the assets that we're able to maintain and develop in the portfolio and the exposure we have to different markets. And again, that strength comes through in what has been a tough year in a couple of commodities, thermal coal, diamonds, but in PGMs, iron ore across the board. I think we saw a 2% improvement in price over the course of the year, but a 9% improvement in performance, which is pointing to both the quality of the portfolio or the diversity of the portfolio and the quality of the assets. 
And then finally, our offer for Sirius is in place. Under takeover rules, I won't be able to say more than I've already said. I will make a few comments. But again, I will be consistent, and we'll be happy to take questions. But as you would expect, we are somewhat constrained in what we can say. And I think people are probably a little bit disappointed in terms of the questions they've asked and what I've said in response to those questions. Nothing new here in terms of our conversations. But I think I should make the point that, for us, it's not inconsistent with our strategy. In fact, we think it's absolutely consistent, which is about focus on quality, focus on driving margins and returns over the long term and having a key effect with potentially another great asset to follow that in terms of development works well with all of the things that we've been talking to over the last 5 or 6 years. 
Stephen, can I have the clicker? Yes, sorry. So just to roll through on the agenda. I've gone past through dinner already. Just quickly, I'll do the transformation journey. Stephen will pick up the financials and talk to the numbers, the important bit. I'll talk to the growth and our approach going forward and then how we see ourselves positioned for the future. And I hope continue to help people understand how we see ourselves differentiating in the industry in which we work. 
Again, on the results, margins, effectiveness. And we -- when we talk about the business, we talk about measuring performance in 3 streams. Firstly, effectiveness. As a team, our job, our success is ultimately measured on the cash flow that we deliver from the business, and it's all about cash flow. We do talk to free cash flow, and we talk to sustainable free cash flow, which is cash flow before growth projects. So from our point of view, making sure we've got the balance but it's about generating cash flow, and that's our effectiveness measure, and we continue to improve the underlying business. 
Measuring the efficiency of those cash flows is our capital return measure, which is return on capital employed, and there are different capital return measures and each of you use [ CRM ]. But for us, it's about making sure we're focused on working every dollar as hard as we can, and our threshold return is 15%. Now you'll see this year that we've delivered 19%, which is above the threshold. But we look at those 2 numbers together to understand how well we're doing as a business because at the end of the day, if you're not delivering 15%, then you're starting to get close to value destruction, which, at the end of the day, means you don't and you're not creating a sustainable business. 
And then finally, sustainability has a number of mentions that we talk to, starting from safety, environment, developing people, social performance right the way through to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. And for us, looking at those pillars is as much about the first 2 numbers is making sure that we can deliver those results sustainably. And when we talk about capital allocation, it's about making sure we've got those 3 elements all heading in the same direction. In simple terms, we focus about -- we focus on getting those 3 dimensions right, and that's certainly where we've been from where we started in terms of the transformation journey. 
So to start with some key elements of that sustainability conversation, as Stuart pointed out, we've lost 4 colleagues in the year. And despite it being the best-ever safety performance that we've delivered, now you're as a good year if you've lost a colleague. The Elimination of Fatalities' work is absolutely key to the improvements and, ultimately, delivering on that promise of zero harm, but it also touches all other elements of the business. 
Health in our industry, quite frankly, has been an even more difficult issue and a bigger killer, the natural safety incidents over the long term. And I'm proud to say, and if you look back at around 2007, we lost over 600 colleagues to HIV stroke age-related illnesses. For the first time in the last 30-odd years, the number last year was 0. And that's a remarkable achievement, and it speaks to the lead that Anglo American took in South Africa and on a global basis in working with its employees and helping people understand what we could do to make a difference, including the first company, first major company that actually provided antiretroviral drugs to employees and their families. And for us, that achievement is as significant as anything we've done, and it speaks to who we are as a company and very much that purpose conversation that Stuart was talking to. It's one thing to talk about a purpose. It's another thing to live it, and we're certainly focused on living it. 
On environment, we continue to improve. I think the environmental performance reflects the focus on planning, understanding risk and making sure we control those risks. We've still got a lot of work to do within the operations, but in many ways, it's a metaphor for the focus the operating model brings and the focus on planning and making sure we're executing the work effectively. 
In terms of transformation, yes, we are a fundamentally transformed business. If you look at where we've come from, you know, most of you know the story, we have focused on the portfolio. Half the assets, we've still grown production by 12% over that period. The thing that's driven that is the technical changes that we've introduced in the assets that we've kept and the underlying efficiency improvements. So the average production from the assets we've retained is 30% higher from where we were back in 2012, '13. As a consequence, our operating cost in real terms have dropped 45% or 29% in nominal terms. And from our perspective, the real challenge going forward is to keep the lead on costs so that we deliver flat or better costs over time. And if we can continue to do that effectively, then we certainly believe margins and returns will continue to grow. And you will see in forecasting forward, where we talk about growing our margins from 40% to 45%, to 45% to 50%, the difference in those 2 numbers is that current prices, we can grow to 45% to 50%
[Technical Difficulty] 
with the focus on operating improvement, improvement in efficiencies through the productivity, doubling of productivity, we've continued to improve our competitive position, which reflects the transformation and the quicker improvement
[Technical Difficulty] 
based on revenue. So we try and get the weighted mix right, and we do that when we measure against our competitors and the data is externally sourced. So we think it's objective. And today -- or last year, based on the space on the first half, we're at 36 percentile. We still haven't got the final year numbers in. But based on what we've seen, we will probably improve a little bit more, but others may also move. So we'll wait and see where the numbers led. But we still remain from what we can see on the frontage of our competitive position. And with the diversity of the portfolio, I think we add another dimension that others don't have in terms of thinking about returns and positioning going forward. 
Consistent with that, we've also done a lot of work on the marketing side. So despite the commodity price, and that red squiggly line is our basket price over time, has actually dropped 5% in gross terms. So our growth in margins from 30% to 40% reflects the cost improvements that we've delivered and with better prices realized for many of our products. We've actually still grown our margins. And again, that's the test of resilience, we call it, in terms of your competitive position and what we can do with margins, and there's still more we can do. 
So with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Otherwise, I would have been the butt of the joke, I'm sure. 
Listen, good morning, and welcome to everyone. There's 3 key themes that I really want to talk you through this morning before I get stuck into the numbers. So it's about continuing delivery, and that's really built off the operating model and the productivity that Mark loves to talk to. It's about the increasing margin. So it's realizing the value from that productivity and dropping that to the bottom line. And then also, it's about the disciplined allocation of cash. So it's about the balance, getting the balance sheet right, allocating capital for the existing business, returns to shareholders, and then obviously, setting us up to deliver the next wave of disciplined growth. 
So turning to the numbers themselves. EBITDA, up 9%. What you see in the numbers, as Mark mentioned, is the benefit of owning quality assets and the diversification across the portfolio. So we had strong iron ore prices and PGM prices offsetting the weakness in the diamond midstream and coal prices; the 6% reduction in costs despite the headwinds that we've encountered, and I'll talk about those in a moment; and as Mark mentioned, again, some great work from the marketing team. 
EPS, up 8% to $2.75 a share. That drove the 40% payout ratio and a dividend of $1.09 per share. In addition, you'll be aware, we announced the USD 1 billion buyback at the half year, and we've progressed that through since then. So CapEx of $3.8 billion and up a little this year with the contribution to Quellaveco and obviously also progress in the Aquila met coal operations and the diamond vessel that we're building for Namibia. So with that, they're up a little bit as expected to $4.6 billion. 
So $10 billion of EBITDA, and we'll do a quick tour around the 4 business units. So diamonds, first of all, as Mark mentioned, the tough year, excess polished inventories in the midstream, some macro uncertainty and also some localized regional events. As a market leader to be responded, cut production and provided some relief in terms of pricing. 
Copper, a really solid plant performance, offsetting some of the water challenges at Los Bronces and then an excellent cost position overall, with C1 costs coming down to $1.26 across the year. 
In PGMs, as I said, EBITDA nearly doubled, significant increase in the basket price. Palladium and rhodium prices have continued in -- to improve into 2020. And that was -- as well, we had about 100,000 platinum ounces rollover from '18 to '19, given some of the load shedding that occurred late in the year. Now we did these calculations I think about midday yesterday, so you have to excuse me. They're probably significantly out of date by the time we speak this morning. So with spot prices, clearly, our margin continues to improve well in excess of 50%, given the basket price is now well in excess of $4,500 per -- an ounce.
Just to give you a sense of the numbers here, that would translate to about $2 billion of platinum revenue, although I noticed that's up significantly overnight, a $4 billion of palladium revenue and about $3.5 billion of rhodium revenue. So you can see the extent those price moves are going to have in terms of cash flow should that continue. 
In terms of Bulks, we benefit from record production at Minas-Rio. At Minas-Rio, a really great performance again from the team, and Kumba recovered through the second half. 
Met coal, great margins there at 43% across the portfolio. Again, a number of moving parts, good iron ore prices, but softer coal, particularly [ Serahan ] reduced production given the weaker European markets. 
So let's have a look at what drives those numbers. So if we work from the left-hand side across to the right, so in terms of macro or external factors, broadly in line year-to-year. So currency, CPI and price broadly offset one another. 
We've also just pulled out for you there the impact of diamond's demand that had in terms of the underlying EBITDA. So that's the buildup in the midstream and the combination of lower index prices and the lower quality mix of diamonds, and therefore, the lower volumes that De Beers put into the marketplace. 
The last couple of slides, we have seen some early signs of recovery, but I would stress it's early. And obviously, the coronavirus provides some uncertainty just as we go through the first half of this year. 
On the controllable side, a decent improvement, $600 million in all, largely driven by the Minas-Rio recovery versus the 2017 production. And we also had a $0.4 million (sic) [ $0.4 billion ] of other cost and volume benefits, but they were offset to provide net $0.1 billion, given the water at Los Bronces for load shedding in PGMs and the loss of the domestic sales towards the end of the year in Kumba. 
Turning to the balance sheet. I can't just follow my page. Turning to the balance sheet. Again, I'm going to really reiterate some of the messages that we've been speaking really consistently about over the last couple of years. So it's about balance, it's about balance sheet strength and discipline so that we can consistently deliver period after period and also drive some of those value-adding growth opportunities over time. Net debt was up as expected. Quellaveco stepped up, in total, $1.3 billion for the year. And also, we had the change in IFRS, in the finance standards accounting, which brought about $0.5 billion of leases onto the balance sheet. 
Just to point out as well that $4.6 billion does include about $300 million of Mitsubishi debt that we consolidate onto our balance sheet given the control. 
The 2 other balance sheet metrics are really important, the 0.5 net debt-to-EBITDA, very comfortable, well within our guidance, and net gearing at a very healthy 13%. Again, a real commitment to ongoing capital discipline so that we do provide that flexibility in the balance sheet should we need it. 
A key part of our thinking is clearly returns to shareholders. Dividend policy of 40% payout resulted in the dividends this year, $1.4 billion in total paid, an average yield of 5% across 2019. This was supplemented by a $1 billion buyback program that we announced at the half year. As of today, we're about $950 million roughly through that buyback program. And consistent with our disclosure, we'd expect to complete that by the end of March. 
Our 40% payout policy will continue through 2020 and '21. As per our normal considerations, if we were to generate excess cash, we will run that through our normal capital allocation considerations. Part of those considerations is that we would always assess whether we would return excess cash to shareholders through either a buyback or special dividend, and there's no change in that respect. 
So how did we go in terms of that capital allocation framework across the year? We generated sustainable free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year. We have spoken about net debt, and, as I say, very pleased with where we are on the balance sheet. We started to allocate more capital to discretionary options because we have got the balance sheet to where we wanted to get it. So that was the $1 billion in terms of the buyback, at which, by December, we'd spent $900 million and then $1.1 billion in terms of gross spend. And I should be aware, the majority of that in terms of the Quellaveco project. 
So really, we think where we've got that again, balanced approach to how we're thinking about capital allocation and cash flow. Just to be clear too, you'll see on that bottom left-hand side, the Sirius would be part of our consideration in terms of how we allocate discretionary cash flow. So very clearly part of our thinking in terms of portfolio upgrade. 
So looking forward, in terms of CapEx, effectively, the same guidance that we gave you back in December. There's a step-up in CapEx for 2020 as we hit peak CapEx year for Quellaveco. The numbers there, do we exclude anything in terms of Sirius? Obviously, still subject to the ongoing offer. Sirius had indicated, and we are comfortable that with their proposed $0.3 billion over the next 2 years as part of their revised development schedule. Importantly, that would mean we're not really focused on heavy cash flow on 2 greenfield projects at the same time that would nicely sequence itself post Quellaveco spin. 
So also looking forward in terms of our $3 billion to $4 billion target. So we set that target just as a reminder from the start of '18 through to the end of '22. And as we've consistently said, some of that will be back-end weighted as we deliver particularly the tech dev and the projects. To date, we've delivered $0.5 billion. We're comfortable that our improvement run rate that we're seeing and our equipment performance is in excess of that. Some of that will come through over time as it gets released from working capital and flows through the system, and some of it in this second half, in particular, has been eaten up a little bit by some of those headwinds that I spoke about, water, load shedding, et cetera. But it's our job to make sure that we give that value visibility and getting all parts of our business to operate at those same run rates so that we see that value drop to the bottom line. 
For 2020, we've identified further improvements of $0.4 billion, no pressure, Natascha, but partly driven by improved performance in the smelting and refining at Kumba -- sorry, at PGMs and a little bit of a turnaround in consistency of performance at Kumba. Remember, they had a few maintenance issues early last year. 
We have seen no -- as most of you would be aware, we had a roof collapse at Moranbah in January. Importantly, no one was hurt in that process, so the team did a great job. We were in the middle of a longwall move, and that will now take us about 8 weeks longer than what was originally planned. So we will lose around 2 million tonnes of production for Moranbah. However, we will try to make some of that up from Grosvenor, and obviously, we've got the balance of the year to really try to outperform to get that back. That results in about a $0.2 billion impact on EBITDA. And you will notice, if you've had a chance to look at the guidance, we've adjusted our guidance on met coal production for the year by about that sum. 
So looking at the 3 categories. Again, operating model P101, strong performance but partly offset. The tech dev, we continue to work on program, we're rolling out the initiative. The benefits will largely come through in '21 and '22. And again, just to give you a flavor of that, the ore sorting at El Soldado is in and running. I think it's the second half this year as the ore processing -- sorry, the coarse particle flotation circuit will be in. And then we're also putting in the ore sorters at Mogalakwena and Barro Alto as we speak. So you should start to see some of those benefits flow through. 
Mark will touch on the growth projects in a moment, but all on time and on budget, and they obviously contribute to, I've said, towards the end of that '22 period. 
So just before I hand back to Mark, once again, fully committed to the balanced approach of running a strong balance sheet, flexibility through the cycle so that we can focus and create on long-term value for not only our shareholders but all of our stakeholders. We'll continue with attractive returns and balance as we think about those returns to shareholders as we try to look after both today's cash flow and the generation of tomorrow's cash flows. So a disciplined, value-adding approach. 
Mark mentioned the long-term EBITDA margin target, so I won't go into that again. But we do believe that we've got some upside still to flow through that as we deliver those underlying improvements in the business so that we get an increased sustainable margin, both at spot prices and that long-term consensus pricing. 
Mark, back to you."

We had a pretty tough start to the soccer year this year with Watford not winning again. Last 10 games do. They've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier lead. So for those other Watford",1693,"I think you've got to hand it to Stephen. We had a pretty tough start to the soccer year this year with Watford not winning again. Last 10 games do. They've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier lead. So for those other Watford supporters, Duncan, you commiserate. 
Disciplined growth. So where to next? The first point I'd like to make in the conversation around the growth, it's not simply about top line growth. When we talk growth, it's about growing value. And so there, for us, it's growing top line revenues and it's about growing margins in particular. And so for us, growth is about growing cash flow and growing returns. And I obviously touched something there. There we go. 
So for us, it's about sustainable free cash flow and returns, and that's really the key part of our focus. Well, that's really where the focus is for us as a group. 
Okay. In terms of projects, Quellaveco, doing well on time, on budget, very pleased with the progress we've seen. And again, I'd invite you to have a quick chat to Tom while he's here. Again, the complexities, and there are political complexities in all of the jurisdictions that the mining industry operate, but I think we've navigated those extremely well. And the local community relationships are exceptional. And for Peru, if you can get those relationships right, it's a key to being successful in the country. And so I think the team has done a good job, and we're very pleased with the progress so far. 
In terms of De Beers, with the new boat going -- is it a ship or a boat, Bruce? It's a ship. Stuart is going to kick me for even asking the question. Very happy with the progress, and the team has done a great job in working with the manufacturers, and I think they're doing very well in time. Just to remind you, the quality of the diamonds from the marine projects is very high. It's around $500 a carat. And so it really does add quality and margin again to the De Beers' work and a very important one for us. 
Aquila met coal, going very well, decline, a pretty straightforward operation, but an important one that picks up where Grasstree will finish off with its life. So very pleased with progress right across the board. And certainly, a 2-path growth engine seems to be going very well, and we've got a number of things still to come through Moranbah-Grosvenor that Stephen's talked about. 
In terms of Sirius, I will stick closer to my script. It is a quality asset. We've talked about the polyhalite resource being a very different type of product, multinutrient, low chloride, low cost. It's a product that will travel. And certainly, the feedback we've had when we've done our due diligence work has been very positive. And in particular, the form that the product comes in is very important in terms of the value proposition. So we think it has good potential. Obviously, there's still a lot more work to do. And taking all those factors into account, we think the offer that we have is fair and reasonable, and it's taken all of those issues into proper account. 
The only other point I would make is we still have a way to go. There still is a vote from shareholders required, and all we ask is that shareholders take note of the Chairman's statement in the documentation regarding their recommendation in terms of the Anglo offer. And so from our perspective, it's a work in progress, still a long way to go. And again, we encourage those shareholders to look at the statement from the Chairman and the directors in terms of the Anglo proposition that is currently sitting before them. 
In terms of the future and how we think about the business, it is very much about quality assets. And again, our conversation around Sirius fits into that conversation as we do see there's a potential Tier 1 asset. And for us, we think that our focus in terms of what we've been doing with the portfolio, with the portfolio on a broader basis is consistent with those themes. We are continuing to shape the portfolio on the basis of a quality asset in markets that we think have potential strong pricing fundamentals and, from our perspective, something that we understand and we believe we can do well in. 
Our business model and the way we invest across the value chain is fundamentally different to our competitors. Our business model is a very different business model to a trading model or a logistics model. It is about understanding what we do from mine through to customer and consumer and making sure that we're investing in leverage points across the value chain. And that is a different approach. That approach has been absolutely clear as a bell, obviously, in De Beers. But our investment in platinum and the profile we've taken in the PGM industry is unique as well, and the work on venture capital in helping promote uses of platinum and other materials in terms of the hydrogen economy is how we differentiate ourselves in the way we think about our business and the models we're creating. 
In terms of FutureSmart mining, when we talk about carbon neutrality or we talk about the way the mining industry needs to look in 5, 10, 20 years, we've been in a strategic conversation for 6 years. FutureSmart mining is about changing the way mining is carried out so that we can ultimately get to carbon neutrality that we can ultimately reduce our footprint and connect ourselves to local community in a very different way compared to what we've done as an industry in the past. Our regional collaborative development model is unique. GemFair, working with our traditional miners and government to change the nature of mining is strategic, it's different. And we understand, in some cases, people struggle with some of the things we're doing. But as each day goes by, what we're doing makes more sense to those that talk ESG. It's not about talking, it's about walking. And we're proud to say that in the last 3 or 4 weeks with the publishing of the Responsibility Index, which is walk versus talk, we've come up as the top resources company. Now the challenge is to continue walking and leading the industry and the changes that we've talked to. And those conversations will lead us -- and those approaches will lead us in terms of how we profile the business in terms of Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 positions. But anything we talk to, any target we set will be based on the way we believe we should be transforming the business. It will have substance behind it. That's an important point. And for us, FutureSmart is the substance behind the conversation, and we've been there for 6 years. 
And putting all those pieces together, it's about people. We've built and developed, we think, an exceptional team across the business. We continue to evolve the business. And from our perspective, it's about people and about making sure we've got the right people in the right roles. And so we believe that, that will always be a work in progress, but it is again a defining position for us in the industry. 
On asset portfolio, again, Stephen, I think, said it well, a clip on diamonds and in PGMs, we are industry leaders. We take that leadership role seriously in terms of the way we talk to our industry, the way we talk to our products, the way we interface with both customers and consumers, and we understand the difference between the 2 and how we're developing our business for the longer term. Clearly, Bruce and his team are doing a lot of work in rethinking and reimagining the way diamond should be taken forward, and we're looking at every part of the value chain in terms of how it can make a more significant contribution in driving long-term value. Very important piece for us. And Chris has done the same in the PGM industry. 
Our high-quality bulks are unique in terms of quality. And for us, we've been positioning in that business the way we have for some years. We've taken Kumba's product from about 62%, 63% to 64.5% on the basis that we believe the market will reward quality, consistency and the relationship that we create in our markets and put that with our marketing work, again, a unique positioning in the industry. And with copper, nickel and other products we produce, again, a very much a future-facing portfolio, which we think is very much a differentiating factor in terms of the future and ultimately, we think future returns. 
Our investment proposition, again, is based on competitive assets, and you've seen our improvement in competitive position. We have built a differentiated set of capabilities. We've been thinking strategically from day 1 in terms of our transformation. How do we create a company that leads the industry and the way it thinks about how its services society and delivers the products the right way and in a way that are valued by society in terms of what we bring to the conversation? And those footprints and the work we're doing is consistent with that differentiated set of capabilities. A lot of people now are talking about focus on technical, focusing on operating capacities, we've been there for 6 years. 
And then finally, in terms of returns. When Stephen talks about balance, it is about discipline in capital allocation, investing in the right things and making sure the business is sustainable in every sense of the word. So whether it's a safety conversation or whether it's a growth conversation or whether it's a competitive cost position, it's all about building a sustainable business. And By that, we mean delivering sustainable returns and improving returns to our shareholders. 
So with that, Stephen and I would be thrilled to take your questions."

Firstly, just on capital allocation. Stephen, you obviously gave us a nice sort of pie chart, and that is on a consolidated basis. But if you look at the ex South African net debt, that went up from about 8.5  -- I can think of another $400 million, $500 million up. So you're essentially buying back from debt. Could you give us an idea of the split just between how much you bought back in South Africa and in -- outside of South Africa? And obviously, you've said in the past, that does matter. I mean, with CapEx now rising, do you think it's -- there's room for more buybacks down the line? I mean, obviously, cash flow generation is very strong. A lot of that is in South Africa. So maybe just how you think about that? 
And then secondly, just on diamonds. You've obviously kept your guidance at 32 to 34. So that's roughly, let's say, 2 million to 3 million carats additional supply this year versus last year. You also have, let's say, $400 million or $500 million of inventory that you're looking to sell down this year. Do you think, given the environment with the coronavirus and Alrosa are looking to destock by 4 million, 5 million carats, it's appropriate to still maintain that? Or was it more you'll see how things go and adjust when appropriate?"

So -- and the way we implemented that buyback was consistent with a proportional representation of the register. So it was a proportional buyback in South Africa as well as it was out of London. So I suppose we kept that fairly constant. 
Remembering also that we have the majority of those South African dollars held in U.S. dollars in London. And so at year-end, we actually had very limited local currency in South Africa. You'll see that we don't see the detail in the notes. So I'd have to say we're fairly comfortable. And practically, it doesn't have a big impact in terms of how we manage the cash."

I would argue that the Anglo American global story is just as exciting, but we've probably got a much broader pool that we're playing in. And over time, we've experienced those things tend to normalize out. So I think it's the normal ebb and flow we see in terms of differences. 
Our job at Anglo is to keep growing the business in terms of margins and cash flow. And where we were trading maybe at a 40% discount a year or 2 ago, we're at about 19% discount. If we keep closing that gap and deliver a 30-odd percent return to shareholders, at some point people start switching their money on a broader basis. And our appeal to generalists, we think, is something that could quite materially change how people look at us. So we're focused on the big guide, the longer-term guide and the fact that we've got assets making a great contribution, it's a bigger story. Copper, the whole story is, in our view, the main gun, okay? 
Quellaveco. Look, the guys are doing a good job. On paper, we're doing extremely well. But I've been around this industry for 43 years. I've run major projects. You can lose the gains very quickly. And so from our point of view, we'd like to see a little bit more time and finish off, we'd like to see the concrete finished in the mill, in particular, because we've still got, what, 60-odd thousand tonnes of concrete to place in the mill time. So before I start flapping my gums and looking too excited, I'd like to see that done. So -- but we're making good progress. There is no doubt on the technical aspects, we're doing extremely well.

I'm certainly one that would say the underlying demand fundamentals appear to be very strong. But at the same time, we would still expect to see some switching from palladium to platinum over time. Interesting to see the platinum price start to jump around a little bit as well. So we'll see what that actually means. But from our point of view, we're investing in the right things. We've made it very clear that we're pushing along with Mogalakwena. Not exactly sure what the final outcome at Mogalakwena will be, but for our point of view, that's a priority project. It stands on its own 2 feet, either at long-term pricing or current pricing. And we'll keep pushing that along pretty aggressively. 
We're also very clean on the Amandelbult  modernization program as well and getting the chrome out at full capacity as well. 
So we've got a number of strings to our bow in South Africa. It's very exciting."

On the PGM prices, there is no doubt there's a shortage of palladium and rhodium. And what we're seeing is strong demand for both. And if I could use the description, an automobile CEO won't get fired for spending $50 per car extra on PGM, but they might get fired for not meeting their emission targets. So the demand is real. We've seen increases in consumption per car, particularly in China, as they've tightened the limits. So these are real demand trends. The question for us is more around, will there be some switching? Because don't forget, palladium is very important in terms of either heat source in the car, whereas platinum is more effective further down the process. 
So there's some technical questions. The real question is, how long will the technical people take and what can they do to maybe shift the use of platinum, palladium and rhodium around? Rhodium is used for a whole range of things. So the world is short rhodium clearly at the moment. And I'm not sure there's a lot more coming on in the near term. So it's in a pretty good position. Platinum, I still think will be a beneficiary, but it might take a little bit longer. 
In terms of Mogalakwena, to get it into 2 parts, you've got 1/3 or a new concentrator, which would be certainly in the 1 billion to 1.5 billion type range, but you've also then got the technical type solutions where it might be all sorting and a whole range of incremental capital options that give you a far better return. 
So we've got a fair range of things that we're looking at. And from our perspective, I wouldn't like to call it here or there because this technical stuff is really coming along extremely well.

Again, just about capital discipline. We're not going to rush out, as Mark said, just because we have a high price today. We want to make the right long-term decisions in how we spend that capital. 
On the overall CapEx question, a couple of points to make. Obviously, as we deliver Quellaveco, Moranbah Grosvenor brownfield, the new ship in Namibia, we'll be generating additional cash flows from all of those businesses as well as additional cash flows from the underlying business, given the improvements that we're focused on. So the business will be, I think, in quite a different place in the next couple of years. 
Could we have a sequence then of other capital projects without preempting any decision? Potentially so. But obviously, each of those decisions will be made in their own right based on meeting metrics, based on a view of markets, not just for the now, but for the longer term. So how that plays out, we'll have to wait and see how markets develop. But potentially, we could have some internal options in front of us.

Tony, I think that's the plan in terms of the work you're doing with NG, it's the partnership with NG. That would be a precursor to a broader commitment on hydrogen options for our off-truck -- off-highway truck fleet. That's part of our whole carbon gas or decarbonization strategy. 
We're also looking at something in the Northern Cape. We've had discussions with the various ministers in South Africa, very supportive of those types of options.  Their main point is that they are not keen to see people selling back into grid. So you do a self-consigned system, which works perfectly for what we want to do because we would use excess capacity to generate hydrogen so that we continue to decarbonize on a much broader footprint.

But as Stephen said, we've got a clear -- we can see how to clear what we've got, but we're going to keep improving. So there's going to be more there that we're going to have to clear through. So we'll keep you posted."

It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the presentation. 
And firstly, as an enterprise we have a very clear purpose, which is to reengineer mining to improve people's lives, improve people's lives, all people, our employees and contractors who work in our organizations, but also all of our other stakeholders, and including, of course, the billions of people who live on this planet and who go about their daily lives, consuming directly and indirectly a lot of the products that we make available. Now there are a lot of things that we need to concentrate on, to improve in order to live that purpose. But there is one screamingly obvious one, of course, and that is our target of zero harm for the employees and contractors who work for us day in, day out. 
And as you're going to hear from Mark shortly, very unfortunately last year, 4 of our employees through our contractors lost their lives going about their work in our managed operations. And Mark will give you some more detail beyond that. That's tough, right? Now that is the best-ever performance, but that is scant comfort for the families of those 4. And I think that what's really important is to understand that improve people's lives when you ended 4 is a constant vigil. 
Now what comfort can we take? We can take comfort from the fact that, again, last year, year-on-year, we improved the important underlying safety measures of performance that we have on a kind of historic basis. So that's good news. And secondly, the work streams, all of the work streams of The Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce that was kicked off in earnest about 18 months ago, properly in earnest to redouble our efforts have all progressed really, really well. So we're happy we're doing the right things, we're happy we're on the path, but we have got a long way to go. And please be assured that the Board of the company, of Anglo American, are very serious about this. 
The second and last subject I wanted to cover was since July, when I presented last time, we've had 2 more Board changes. And I just want you to join me in welcoming our 2 new nonexecutive directors to the Board, both from South Africa. Hixonia Nyasulu, who joined in November of last year; and Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who joined last month. So welcome to them. Other than that, the Board is as it was. 
Let me now hand over to Mark and Stephen, and initially Mark, to take us through last year."

I'm a Chelsea supporter, so we haven't spoken much during the course of this week. 
Ladies and gentlemen, what I'd like to do is just point you to -- you each have one of these on your chairs, which is what to do in the case of an emergency. There are no drills scheduled for this morning, so you shouldn't, one hopes, need. But in the event we do, can you make sure you've got that in your hand and follow the processes that have been outlined? Very important. Thank you. 
Again, just for me to acknowledge colleagues, Stuart, thank you for the opening. Colleagues, please take the opportunity to talk to people. I know some of you already have this morning. Most importantly, we have Chris Griffith with us today. Chris has flown in from South Africa overnight. As you are aware, Chris informed all of us of his intention to step down. And what I would like to say and acknowledge Chris for the wonderful contribution he's made to Anglo American over the last 30 years. 
And if I could make a special observation consistent with the Chairman's observation. For the first time in our history in the PGMs business, 0 fatality in our operations. And for those that understand, we are still a deep underground miner. It's a remarkable achievement. And from me, Chris, congratulations. 
We also have announced this morning -- or Anglo Platinum has announced this morning the appointment of Natascha Viljoen to replace Chris. Natascha is with us this morning. So welcome, Natascha. Big boots to fill, but we've known Natascha for about -- for almost 6 years now at Anglo, and she's made a tremendous contribution in her time in the group, and looking forward to the contribution that she will make in terms of the future of the business. 
I believe Themba Mkhwanazi is going to be here, but I haven't seen him yet, but just to let you know that he should be here. And we also have Tom McCulley. Tom, could you put your hand up? Tom is the leader on the Quellaveco project. He gave the briefing to the Board this week, and certainly from our perspective, thrilled with the progress that's being made. And again, if you've got a minute, I'm sure Tom would love to tell you about his project. He certainly gave the Board and the executive a great summary of where we're up to and very pleasing where it's up to as we stand today. 
To yourselves, thank you for joining us. It's been another important year for Anglo American. It's been a solid year in terms of results as we continue to build on the foundations that we've created over the last few years. We do see continuing upside and obviously the focus in how do we continue to maintain the rate, if you like, or the momentum that we've created. The P101 and  our other operations improvement work is very important to us. We are not yet best of the best. We have improved our competitive position significantly, but there's a lot more we can do, and we remain focused on doing that work. And consistent with that is our improvement in safety, and those 2 pieces go hand-in-hand. 
Our broader technical changes that we introduced in the business have certainly had a big impact, and there's more we can do. And our marketing innovation work is something that doesn't get a lot of airplay, but has been significant. And certainly, as you see, a number of our major competitors starting to restructure their marketing businesses and almost duplicating what we've put in place. It certainly says a lot to Peter and the team, in terms of the work they've done. 
I will talk about FutureSmart a little bit later in my presentation. But again, a lot of people talking about technical innovation and getting the engine room working. And certainly, I think we're hearing a lot of terms that we've been using for a number of years now being thrown around in different parts of the industry. 
And our portfolio enhancement project, we remain committed to disciplined capital, a balanced approach to investments in the business to ensure that we continue to improve margins and returns. And from our point of view, we think that is the key to ensuring that we retain a consistent improvement in our performance over the longer haul. 
Good news and the bad news, diamonds, tough; PGMs, great year. The beauty of being a diversified miner is the quality of the assets that we're able to maintain and develop in the portfolio and the exposure we have to different markets. And again, that strength comes through in what has been a tough year in a couple of commodities, thermal coal, diamonds, but in PGMs, iron ore across the board. I think we saw a 2% improvement in price over the course of the year, but a 9% improvement in performance, which is pointing to both the quality of the portfolio or the diversity of the portfolio and the quality of the assets. 
And then finally, our offer for Sirius is in place. Under takeover rules, I won't be able to say more than I've already said. I will make a few comments. But again, I will be consistent, and we'll be happy to take questions. But as you would expect, we are somewhat constrained in what we can say. And I think people were probably a little bit disappointed in terms of the questions they've asked and what I've said in response to those questions. Nothing new here in terms of our conversations. But I think I should make the point that for us, it's not inconsistent with our strategy. In fact, we think it's absolutely consistent, which is about focus on quality, focus on driving margins and returns over the long term and having a key effect with potentially another great asset to follow that in terms of development works well with all of the things that we've been talking to over the last 5 or 6 years. 
Stephen, can I have the clicker? Yes, sorry. So just to roll through on the agenda. I've gone past the agenda already. Just quickly, I'll do the transformation journey. Stephen will pick up the financials and talk to the numbers, the important bit. I'll talk to the growth and our approach going forward and then how we see ourselves positioned for the future. And I hope continue to help people understand how we see ourselves differentiating in the industry in which we work. 
Again, on the results, margins, effectiveness. And we -- when we talk about the business, we talk about measuring performance in 3 streams. Firstly, effectiveness. As a team, our job, our success is ultimately measured on the cash flow that we deliver from the business, and it's all about cash flow. We do talk to free cash flow, and we talk to sustainable free cash flow, which is cash flow before growth projects. So from our point of view, making sure we've got the balance, but it's about generating cash flow, and that's our effectiveness measure, and we continue to improve the underlying business. 
Measuring the efficiency of those cash flows is our capital return measure, which is return on capital employed, and there are different capital return measures. Each of you use your own. But for us, it's about making sure we're focused on working every dollar as hard as we can, and our threshold return is 15%. Now you'll see this year that we've delivered 19%, which is above the threshold. But we look at those 2 numbers together to understand how well we're doing as a business.  Because at the end of the day, if you're not delivering 15%, then you're starting to get close to value destruction which, at the end of the day means you don't, and you're not creating a sustainable business. 
And then finally, sustainability has a number of dimensions that we talk to, starting from safety, environment, developing people, social performance right the way through to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. And for us, looking at those pillars is as much about the first 2 numbers as making sure that we can deliver those results sustainably. And when we talk about capital allocation, it's about making sure we've got those 3 elements all heading in the same direction. In simple terms, we focus about -- we focus on getting those 3 dimensions right, and that's certainly where we've been from where we started in terms of the transformation journey. 
So to start with some key elements of that sustainability conversation, as Stuart pointed out, we've lost 4 colleagues in the year. And despite it being the best-ever safety performance that we've delivered, no year is a good year if you've lost a colleague. The Elimination of Fatalities' work is absolutely key to the improvements and, ultimately, delivering on that promise of zero harm, but it also touches all other elements of the business. 
Health in our industry, quite frankly, has been an even more difficult issue and a bigger killer than actual safety incidents over the long term. And I'm proud to say, and if you look back at around 2007, we lost over 600 colleagues to HIV/ AIDS-related illnesses. For the first time in the last 30-odd years, the number last year was 0. And that's a remarkable achievement, and it speaks to the lead that Anglo American took in South Africa and on a global basis, in working with its employees and helping people understand what we could do to make a difference, including the first company, first major company that actually provided antiretroviral drugs to employees and their families. And for us, that achievement is as significant as anything we've done, and it speaks to who we are as a company and is very much that purpose conversation that Stuart was talking to. It's one thing to talk about a purpose. It's another thing to live it, and we're certainly focused on living it. 
On environment, we continue to improve. I think the environmental performance reflects the focus on planning, understanding risk and making sure we control those risks. We've still got a lot of work to do within the operations, but in many ways it's a metaphor for the focus the operating model brings and the focus on planning and making sure we're executing the work effectively. 
In terms of transformation, yes, we are a fundamentally transformed business. If you look at where we've come from, you know, most of you know the story, we have focused on the portfolio. Half the assets, we've still grown production by 12% over that period. The thing that's driven that is the technical changes that we've introduced in the assets that we've kept and the underlying efficiency improvements. So the average production from the assets we've retained is 30% higher from where we were back in 2012, '13. As a consequence, our operating costs in real terms have dropped 45% or 29% in nominal terms. And from our perspective, the real challenge going forward is to keep the lid on costs so that we deliver flat or better costs over time. And if we can continue to do that effectively, then we certainly believe margins and returns will continue to grow. And you will see in forecasting forward, where we talk about growing our margins from 40% to 45%, to 45% to 50%, the difference in those 2 numbers is at current prices, we can grow to 45% to 50%
[Technical Difficulty] 
with the focus on operating improvement, improvement in efficiencies through the productivity, doubling of productivity, we've continued to improve our competitive position, which reflects the transformation and the quicker improvement
[Technical Difficulty] 
based on revenue. So we try and get the weighted mix right, and we do that when we measure against our competitors and the data is externally sourced. So we think it's objective. And today -- or last year, based on the first half, we're at 36th percentile. We still haven't got the final year numbers in. But based on what we've seen, we will probably improve a little bit more, but others may also move. So we'll wait and see where the numbers land. But we still remain, from what we can see, on the front edge of our competitive position. And with the diversity of the portfolio, I think we add another dimension that others don't have in terms of thinking about returns and positioning going forward. 
Consistent with that, we've also done a lot of work on the marketing side. So despite the commodity price, and that red squiggly line is our basket price over time, has actually dropped 5% in gross terms. So our growth in margins from 30% to 40% reflects the cost improvements that we've delivered. And with better prices realized for many of our products, we've actually still grown our margins. And again, that's the test of resilience, we call it, in terms of your competitive position and what you can do with margins, and there's still more we can do. 
So with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Otherwise I would have been the butt of the opening joke, I'm sure. 
Listen, good morning, and welcome to everyone. There's 3 key themes that I really want to talk you through this morning before I get stuck and in the numbers. So it's about continuing delivery, and that's really built off the operating model and the productivity that Mark loves to talk to. It's about the increasing margin. So it's realizing the value from that productivity and dropping that to the bottom line. And then also, it's about the disciplined allocation of cash. So it's about the balance, getting the balance sheet right, allocating capital for the existing business, returns to shareholders, and then obviously, setting us up to deliver the next wave of disciplined growth. 
So turning to the numbers themselves. EBITDA, up 9%. What you see in the numbers, as Mark mentioned, is the benefit of owning quality assets and the diversification across the portfolio. So we had strong iron ore prices and PGM prices offsetting the weakness in the diamond midstream and coal prices. A 6% reduction in costs despite the headwinds that we've encountered, and I'll talk about those in a moment; and as Mark mentioned, again some great work from the marketing team. 
EPS, up 8% to $2.75 a share. That drove the 40% payout ratio and a dividend of $1.09 per share. In addition, you'll be aware we announced the USD 1 billion buyback at the half year, and we've progressed that through since then. So CapEx of $3.8 billion, up a little this year with the contribution to Quellaveco and obviously also progress in the Aquila met coal operations and the diamond vessel that we're building for Namibia. So with that, they're up a little bit as expected to $4.6 billion. 
So $10 billion of EBITDA, and we'll do a quick tour around the 4 business units. So diamonds, first of all, as Mark mentioned, a tough year, excess polished inventories in the midstream, some macro uncertainty and also some localized regional events. As the market leader [ TB has ] responded, cut production and provided some relief in terms of pricing. 
Copper, a really solid plant performance, offsetting some of the water challenges at Los Bronces. And then an excellent cost position overall, with C1 costs coming down to $1.26 across the year. 
In PGMs, as I said, EBITDA nearly doubled, significant increase in the basket price. Palladium and rhodium prices have continued in -- to improve into 2020. And that was -- as well, we had about 100,000 platinum ounces roll over from '18 to '19, given some of the load shedding that occurred late in the year. Now we did these calculations I think about midday yesterday, so you'll have to excuse me. They're probably significantly out of date by the time we speak this morning. So with spot prices, clearly, our margin continues to improve, well in excess of 50%, given the basket price is now well in excess of $4,500 per platinum ounce.
Just to give you a sense of the numbers here, that would translate to about $2 billion of platinum revenue, although I noticed that's up significantly overnight, a $4 billion of palladium revenue and about $3.5 billion of rhodium revenue. So you can see the extent those price moves are going to have in terms of cash flow should that continue. 
In terms of Bulks, we benefit from record production at Minas-Rio. At Minas-Rio, a really great performance again from the team, and Kumba recovered through the second half. 
Met coal, great margins there at 43% across the portfolio. Again, a number of moving parts, good iron ore prices, but softer coal, particularly [ Serahan ] reduced production given the weaker European markets. 
So let's have a look at what drives those numbers. So if we work from the left-hand side across to the right, so in terms of macro external factors, broadly in line year-to-year. So currency, CPI and price broadly offset one another. 
We've also just pulled out for you there the impact of diamond's demand that had in terms of the underlying EBITDA. So that's the buildup in the midstream and the combination of lower index prices and the lower quality mix of diamonds, and therefore the lower volumes that De Beers put into the marketplace. 
The last couple of slides, we have seen some early signs of recovery, but I would stress it's early. And obviously, the coronavirus provides some uncertainty just as we go through the first half of this year. 
On the controllable side, a decent improvement, $600 million in all, largely driven by the Minas-Rio recovery versus the 2017 production. And we also had a $0.4 billion of other cost and volume benefits, but they were offset to provide net $0.1 billion, given the water at Los Bronces for load shedding in PGMs and the loss of the domestic sales towards the end of the year in Kumba. 
Turning to the balance sheet - if I can just find my page. Turning to the balance sheet. Again, I'm going to really reiterate some of the messages that we've been speaking really consistently about over the last couple of years. So it's about balance, it's about balance sheet strength and discipline so that we can consistently deliver period after period and also drive some of those value-adding growth opportunities over time. Net debt was up as expected. Quellaveco stepped up, in total $1.3 billion for the year. And also, we had the change in IFRS, in the finance standards accounting, which brought about $0.5 billion of leases onto the balance sheet. 
Just to point out as well that $4.6 billion does include about $300 million of Mitsubishi debt that we consolidate onto our balance sheet, given the control. 
The 2 other balance sheet metrics that are really important, the 0.5 net debt-to-EBITDA, very comfortable, well within our guidance, and net gearing at a very healthy 13%. Again, a real commitment to ongoing capital discipline so that we do provide that flexibility in the balance sheet should we need it. 
A key part of our thinking is clearly returns to shareholders. Dividend policy of 40% payout resulted in the dividends this year, $1.4 billion in total paid, an average yield of 5% across 2019. This was supplemented by a $1 billion buyback program that we announced at the half year. As of today, we're about $950 million roughly through that buyback program. And consistent with our disclosure, we'd expect to complete that by the end of March. 
Our 40% payout policy will continue through 2020 and '21. As per our normal considerations, if we were to generate excess cash, we will run that through our normal capital allocation considerations. Part of those considerations is that we would always assess whether we would return excess cash to shareholders through either a buyback or special dividend, and there's no change in that respect. 
So how did we go in terms of that capital allocation framework across the year? We generated sustainable free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year. We have spoken about net debt, and as I say, very pleased with where we are on the balance sheet. We started to allocate more capital to discretionary options because we have got the balance sheet to where we wanted to get it. So that was the $1 billion in terms of the buyback, at which, by December, we'd spent [ $900 ] million and then $1.1 billion in terms of gross spend. And I should be aware, the majority of that in terms of the Quellaveco project. 
So really, we think where we've got that again, balanced approach to how we're thinking about capital allocation and cash flow. Just to be clear too, you'll see on that bottom left-hand side, the Sirius would be part of our consideration in terms of how we allocate discretionary cash flow. So very clearly part of our thinking in terms of portfolio upgrade. 
So looking forward, in terms of CapEx, effectively the same guidance that we gave you back in December. There's a step-up in CapEx for 2020 as we hit peak CapEx year for Quellaveco. The numbers there do exclude anything in terms of Sirius. Obviously, still subject to the ongoing offer. Sirius had indicated, and we are comfortable that -- with their proposed $0.3 billion over the next 2 years as part of their revised development schedule. Importantly, that would mean we're not really focused on heavy cash flow on 2 greenfield projects; at the same time that would nicely sequence itself post Quellaveco spin. 
So also looking forward in terms of our $3 billion to $4 billion target. So we set that target just as a reminder from the start of '18 through to the end of '22. And as we've consistently said, some of that will be back-end weighted as we deliver particularly the tech dev and the projects. To date, we've delivered $0.5 billion. We're comfortable that our improvement run rate that we're seeing and our equipment performance is in excess of that. Some of that will come through over time as it gets released from working capital and flows through the system. And some of it, in this second half in particular, has been eaten up a little bit by some of those headwinds that I spoke about: water, load shedding, et cetera. But it's our job to make sure that we give that value visibility and getting all parts of our business to operate at those same run rates so that we see that value drop to the bottom line. 
For 2020, we've identified further improvements of $0.4 billion -- no pressure, Natascha -- but partly driven by improved performance in the smelting and refining at Kumba -- sorry, at PGMs -- and a little bit of a turnaround in consistency of performance at Kumba. Remember, they had a few maintenance issues early last year. 
We have seen no -- as most of you would be aware, we had a roof collapse at Moranbah in January. Importantly, no one was hurt in that process, so the team did a great job. We were in the middle of a longwall move, and that will now take us about 8 weeks longer than what was originally planned. So we will lose around 2 million tonnes of production for Moranbah. However, we will try to make some of that up from Grosvenor, and obviously, we've got the balance of the year to really try to outperform to get that back. That results in about a $0.2 billion impact on EBITDA. And you will notice, if you've had a chance to look at the guidance, we've adjusted our guidance on met coal production for the year by about that sum. 
So looking at the 3 categories. Again, operating model P101, strong performance but partly offset. The tech dev, we continue to work on the program, we're rolling out the initiative. The benefits will largely come through in '21 and '22. And again, just to give you a flavor of that, the ore sorter at El Soldado is in and running. I think it's the second half this year the ore processing -- sorry, the coarse particle flotation circuit will be in. And then we're also putting in the ore sorters at Mogalakwena and Barro Alto as we speak. So you should start to see some of those benefits flow through. 
Mark will touch on the growth projects in a moment, but all on time and on budget, and they obviously contribute through, I've said, towards the end of that '22 period. 
So just before I hand back to Mark, once again, fully committed to the balanced approach of running a strong balance sheet, flexibility through the cycle so that we can focus and create on long-term value for not only our shareholders but all of our stakeholders. We'll continue with attractive returns and balance as we think about those returns to shareholders, as we try to look after both today's cash flow and the generation of tomorrow's cash flows. So a disciplined, value-adding approach. 
Mark mentioned the long-term EBITDA margin target, so I won't go into that again. But we do believe that we've got some upside still to flow through that as we deliver those underlying improvements in the business so that we get an increased sustainable margin, both at spot prices and at long-term consensus pricing. 
Mark, back to you."

Last 10 games though, they've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier league. So those other Watford supporters, Duncan, you can commiserate. 
Disciplined growth. So where to next? The first point I'd like to make in the conversation around  growth, it's not simply about top line growth. When we talk growth, it's about growing value. And so there, for us, it's growing top line revenues and it's about growing margins in particular. And so for us, growth is about growing cash flow and growing returns. And I obviously touched something there -- oops, there we go. 
So for us, it's about sustainable free cash flow and returns, and that's really the key part of our focus. Well, that's really where the focus is for us as a group. 
Okay. In terms of projects, Quellaveco, doing well, on time, on budget, very pleased with the progress we've seen. And again, I'd invite you to have a quick chat to Tom while he's here. Again, the complexities, and there are political complexities in all of the jurisdictions that the mining industry operates, but I think we've navigated those extremely well. And the local community relationships are exceptional. And for Peru, if you can get those relationships right, it's a key to being successful in the country. And so I think the team has done a good job, and we're very pleased with the progress so far. 
In terms of De Beers, with the new boat going -- is it a ship or a boat, Bruce? It's a ship. Stuart is going to kick me for even asking the question. Very happy with the progress, and the team has done a great job in working with the manufacturers, and I think they're doing very well in time. Just to remind you, the quality of the diamonds from the marine projects is very high. It's around $500 a carat. And so it really does add quality and margin again to De Beers' work, and a very important one for us. 
Aquila met coal going very well, decline, a pretty straightforward operation, but an important one that picks up where Grasstree will finish off with its life. So very pleased with progress right across the board. And certainly, [ a 2-path ] growth engine seems to be going very well, and we've got a number of things still to come through Moranbah-Grosvenor that Stephen's talked about. 
In terms of Sirius, I will stick closer to my script. It is a quality asset. We've talked about the polyhalite resource being a very different type of product, multinutrient, low chloride, low cost. It's a product that will travel. And certainly the feedback we've had when we've done our due diligence work has been very positive. And in particular, the form that the product comes in is very important in terms of the value proposition. So we think it has good potential. Obviously, there's still a lot more work to do. And taking all those factors into account, we think the offer that we have is fair and reasonable, and it's taken all of those issues into proper account. 
The only other point I would make is we still have a way to go. There still is a vote from shareholders required, and all we ask is that shareholders take note of the Chairman's statement in the documentation regarding their recommendation in terms of the Anglo offer. And so from our perspective, it's a work [ that's ] in progress, still a long way to go. And again, we encourage those shareholders to look at the statement from the Chairman and the directors in terms of the Anglo proposition that is currently sitting before them. 
In terms of the future and how we think about the business, it is very much about quality assets. And again, our conversation around Sirius fits into that conversation, as we do see there's a potential Tier 1 asset. And for us, we think that our focus in terms of what we've been doing with the portfolio, with the portfolio on a broader basis is consistent with those themes. We are continuing to shape the portfolio on the basis of a quality asset in markets that we think have potential strong pricing fundamentals and, from our perspective, something that we understand and we believe we can do well in. 
Our business model and the way we invest across the value chain is fundamentally different to our competitors'. Our business model is a very different business model to a trading model or a logistics model. It is about understanding what we do from mine through to customer and consumer, and making sure that we're investing in leverage points across the value chain. And that is a different approach. That approach has been absolutely clear as a bell, obviously in De Beers. But our investment in platinum and the profile we've taken in the PGM industry is unique as well, and the work on venture capital in helping promote uses of platinum and other materials in terms of the hydrogen economy is how we differentiate ourselves in the way we think about our business and the models we're creating. 
In terms of FutureSmart mining, when we talk about carbon neutrality or we talk about the way the mining industry needs to look in 5, 10, 20 years, we've been in a strategic conversation for 6 years. FutureSmart mining is about changing the way mining is carried out so that we can ultimately get to carbon neutrality, that we can ultimately reduce our footprint and connect ourselves to local community in a very different way compared to what we've done as an industry in the past. Our regional collaborative development model is unique. GemFair, working with our traditional miners and government to change the nature of mining is strategic, it's different. And we understand in some cases, people struggle with some of the things we're doing. But as each day goes by, what we're doing makes more sense to those that talk ESG. It's not about talking, it's about walking. And we're proud to say that in the last 3 or 4 weeks with the publishing of the Responsibility Index, which is walk versus talk, we've come up as the top resources company. Now the challenge is to continue walking and leading the industry and the changes that we've talked to. And those conversations will lead us -- and those approaches will lead us in terms of how we profile the business in terms of Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 positions. But anything we talk to, any target we set will be based on the way we believe we should be transforming the business. It will have substance behind it. That's an important point. And for us, FutureSmart is the substance behind the conversation, and we've been there for 6 years. 
And putting all those pieces together, it's about people. We've built and developed, we think, an exceptional team across the business. We continue to evolve the business. And from our perspective, it's about people and about making sure we've got the right people in the right roles. And so we believe that, that will always be a works in progress, but it is again a defining position for us in the industry. 
On asset portfolio, again Stephen, I think, said it well, a clip on diamonds and in PGMs, we are industry leaders. We take that leadership role seriously in terms of the way we talk to our industry, the way we talk to our products, the way we interface with both customers and consumers, and we understand the difference between the 2 and how we're developing our business for the longer term. Clearly, Bruce and his team are doing a lot of work in rethinking and reimagining the way diamond should be taken forward, and we're looking at every part of the value chain in terms of how it can make a more significant contribution in driving long-term value. Very important piece for us. And Chris has done the same in the PGM industry. 
Our high-quality bulks are unique in terms of quality. And for us, we've been positioning in that business the way we have for some years. We've taken Kumba's product from about 62%, 63% to 64.5% on the basis that we believe the market will reward quality, consistency and the relationship that we create in our markets and put that with our marketing work, again, a unique positioning in the industry. 
And with copper, nickel and other products we produce, again a -- very much a future-facing portfolio, which we think is very much a differentiating factor in terms of the future and ultimately, we think future returns. 
Our investment proposition, again, is based on competitive assets, and you've seen our improvement in competitive position. We have built a differentiated set of capabilities. We've been thinking strategically from day 1 in terms of our transformation. How do we create a company that leads the industry in the way it thinks about how it services society and delivers the products the right way and in a way that are valued by society in terms of what we bring to the conversation? And those footprints and the work we're doing is consistent with that differentiated set of capabilities. A lot of people now are talking about focus on technical, focusing on operating capacities, we've been there for 6 years. 
And then finally, in terms of returns. When Stephen talks about balance, it is about discipline in capital allocation, investing in the right things and making sure the business is sustainable in every sense of the word. So whether it's a safety conversation or whether it's a growth conversation or whether it's a competitive cost position, it's all about building a sustainable business. And by that, we mean delivering sustainable returns and improving returns to our shareholders. 
So with that, Stephen and I would be thrilled to take your questions."

Just 2 questions, if I may. 
Firstly, just on capital allocation. Stephen, you obviously gave us a nice sort of pie chart, and that is on a consolidated basis. But if you look at the ex South African net debt, that went up from about 8.5  -- I think another $400 million, $500 million up. So you were essentially buying back from debt. Could you give us an idea of the split just between how much you bought back in South Africa and in -- outside of South Africa? And obviously, you've said in the past, that does matter. I mean, with CapEx now rising, do you think it's -- there's room for more buybacks down the line? I mean, obviously, cash flow generation is very strong. A lot of that is in South Africa. So maybe just how you think about that? 
And then secondly, just on diamonds. You've obviously kept your guidance at 32 to 34. So that's roughly, let's say, 2 million to 3 million carats additional supply this year versus last year. You also have, let's say, $400 million or $500 million of inventory that you're looking to sell down this year. Do you think, given the environment with the coronavirus and Alrosa are looking to destock by 4 million, 5 million carats, it's appropriate to still maintain that? Or was it more you'll see how things go and adjust when appropriate?"

So remembering a couple of things. So we pay 100% of the group dividend from South African cash. And also, we got permission to pay the full buyback from South African cash. So -- and the way we implemented that buyback was consistent with a proportional representation of the register. So it was a proportional buyback in South Africa as well as it was out of London. So I suppose we kept that fairly constant. 
Remembering also that we have the majority of those South African dollars held in U.S. dollars in London. And so at year-end, we actually had very limited local currency in South Africa. You'll see that when you see the detail in the notes. So I'd have to say we're fairly comfortable. And practically, it doesn't have a big impact in terms of how we manage the cash."

And I would argue that you've got the 2 best investment stories in South Africa by a country mile, and people are investing in a great story. 
I would argue that the Anglo American global story is just as exciting, but we've probably got a much broader pool that we're playing in. And over time, we've experienced those things tend to normalize out. So I think it's the normal ebb and flow we see in terms of differences. 
Our job at Anglo is to keep growing the business in terms of margins and cash flow. And where we were trading maybe at a 40% discount a year or 2 ago, we're at about 19% discount. If we keep closing that gap and deliver a 30-odd percent return to shareholders, at some point people start switching their money on a broader basis. And our appeal to generalists, we think, is something that could quite materially change how people look at us. So we're focused on the big guide, the longer-term guide and the fact that we've got assets making a great contribution, it's a bigger story. Copper, the whole story is, in our view, the main gun, okay? 
Quellaveco. Look, the guys are doing a good job. On paper, we're doing extremely well. But I've been around this industry for 43 years. I've run major projects. You can lose the gains very quickly. And so from our point of view, we'd like to see a little bit more time and finish off -- we'd like to see the concrete finished in the mill, in particular, because we've still got, what, 60-odd thousand tonnes of concrete to place in the mill [ tun ]. So before I start flapping my gums and looking too excited, I'd like to see that done. So -- but we're making good progress. There is no doubt on the technical aspects, we're doing extremely well. But communities, we're interfacing with a lot of people. You want to make sure that you get a little further into the project before you start making extravagant claims in terms of where you are.

I'm certainly one that would say the underlying demand fundamentals appear to be very strong. But at the same time, we would still expect to see some switching from palladium to platinum over time. Interesting to see the platinum price start to jump around a little bit as well. So we'll see what that actually means. But from our point of view, we're investing in the right things. We've made it very clear that we're pushing along with Mogalakwena. Not exactly sure what the final outcome at Mogalakwena will be, but for our point of view, that's a priority project.

And if I could use the description, an automobile CEO won't get fired for spending $50 per car extra on PGMs, but they might get fired for not meeting their emission targets. So the demand is real. We've seen increases in consumption per car, particularly in China, as they've tightened the limits. So these are real demand trends. The question for us is more around, will there be some switching? Because don't forget, palladium is very important in terms of [ being the ] heat source in the car, whereas platinum is more effective further down the process. 
So there are some technical questions. The real question is, how long will the technical people take and what can they do to maybe shift the use of platinum, palladium and rhodium around? Rhodium is used for a whole range of things. So the world is short rhodium clearly at the moment. And I'm not sure there's a lot more coming on in the near term. So it's in a pretty good position. Platinum, I still think will be a beneficiary, but it might take a little bit longer.

Again, just about capital discipline. We're not going to rush out, as Mark said, just because we have a high price today. We want to make the right long-term decisions in how we spend that capital. 
On the overall CapEx question, a couple of points to make. Obviously, as we deliver Quellaveco, Moranbah-Grosvenor brownfield, the new ship in Namibia, we'll be generating additional cash flows from all of those businesses as well as additional cash flows from the underlying business, given the improvements that we're focused on. So the business will be, I think, in quite a different place in the next couple of years. 
Could we have a sequence then of other capital projects without preempting any decision? Potentially so. But obviously, each of those decisions will be made in their own right based on meeting metrics, based on a view of markets, not just for the now, but for the longer term. So how that plays out, we'll have to wait and see how markets develop. But potentially, we could have some internal options in front of us.

But we've got 2 basically around 100-megawatt options we're looking at. One at Mogalakwena, which would be solar. We'd use excess solar capacity to generate hydrogen, and we'll be installing a hydrogen -- and it's a hybrid hydrogen battery truck by the end of the year. Tony, I think that's the plan in terms of the work you're doing with NG, it's the partnership with NG. That would be a precursor to a broader commitment on hydrogen options for our off-truck -- off-highway truck fleet. That's part of our whole carbon gas or decarbonization strategy. 
We're also looking at something in the Northern Cape. We've had discussions with the various ministers in South Africa, very supportive of those types of options. Their main point is that they are not keen to see people selling back into grid. So you do a self-contained system, which works perfectly for what we want to do because we would use excess capacity to generate hydrogen so that we continue to decarbonize on a much broader footprint. So that's absolutely critical. And that logic holds for any jurisdiction we're in. So I think that's part of this pathway 2 in terms of improvement.

I'd love to see that flow out but ultimately, it will depend a little bit on market conditions just as to the time that, that may take. 
We also had a little bit of inventory build or not as much inventory runoff as we would have liked in platinum. So again, I'd love to see some of that run down. 
It's a different mix between the 2. In De Beers, it's really held as finished goods ready to go. In platinum, it's held as, largely as work-in-progress. So getting it through the last phases of the processing plant is really important in that part of the business. And so I'd love to see that perhaps come back towards normal levels again. 
On Los Bronces, I'm not sure I can add too much more to the guidance that we've given. We've given a production range, as Ruben said, of that 620 to 670. That's really around water. So depending on how that plays out over the year, we've had a reasonably good start and we're trying to recover as much water as we can to maximize the volume.

It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the presentation. 
And firstly, as an enterprise we have a very clear purpose, which is to reengineer mining to improve people's lives, improve people's lives, all people, our employees and contractors who work in our organizations, but also all of our other stakeholders, and including, of course, the billions of people who live on this planet and who go about their daily lives, consuming directly and indirectly a lot of the products that we make available. Now there are a lot of things that we need to concentrate on, to improve in order to live that purpose. But there is one screamingly obvious one, of course, and that is our target of zero harm for the employees and contractors who work for us day in, day out. 
And as you're going to hear from Mark shortly, very unfortunately last year, 4 of our employees through our contractors lost their lives going about their work in our managed operations. And Mark will give you some more detail beyond that. That's tough, right? Now that is the best-ever performance, but that is scant comfort for the families of those 4. And I think that what's really important is to understand that improve people's lives when you ended 4 is a constant vigil. 
Now what comfort can we take? We can take comfort from the fact that, again, last year, year-on-year, we improved the important underlying safety measures of performance that we have on a kind of historic basis. So that's good news. And secondly, the work streams, all of the work streams of The Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce that was kicked off in earnest about 18 months ago, properly in earnest to redouble our efforts have all progressed really, really well. So we're happy we're doing the right things, we're happy we're on the path, but we have got a long way to go. And please be assured that the Board of the company, of Anglo American, are very serious about this. 
The second and last subject I wanted to cover was since July, when I presented last time, we've had 2 more Board changes. And I just want you to join me in welcoming our 2 new nonexecutive directors to the Board, both from South Africa. Hixonia Nyasulu, who joined in November of last year; and Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who joined last month. So welcome to them. Other than that, the Board is as it was. 
Let me now hand over to Mark and Stephen, and initially Mark, to take us through last year."

Ladies and gentlemen, what I'd like to do is just point you to -- you each have one of these on your chairs, which is what to do in the case of an emergency. There are no drills scheduled for this morning, so you shouldn't, one hopes, need. But in the event we do, can you make sure you've got that in your hand and follow the processes that have been outlined? Very important. Thank you. 
Again, just for me to acknowledge colleagues, Stuart, thank you for the opening. Colleagues, please take the opportunity to talk to people. I know some of you already have this morning. Most importantly, we have Chris Griffith with us today. Chris has flown in from South Africa overnight. As you are aware, Chris informed all of us of his intention to step down. And what I would like to say and acknowledge Chris for the wonderful contribution he's made to Anglo American over the last 30 years. 
And if I could make a special observation consistent with the Chairman's observation. For the first time in our history in the PGMs business, 0 fatality in our operations. And for those that understand, we are still a deep underground miner. It's a remarkable achievement. And from me, Chris, congratulations. 
We also have announced this morning -- or Anglo Platinum has announced this morning the appointment of Natascha Viljoen to replace Chris. Natascha is with us this morning. So welcome, Natascha. Big boots to fill, but we've known Natascha for about -- for almost 6 years now at Anglo, and she's made a tremendous contribution in her time in the group, and looking forward to the contribution that she will make in terms of the future of the business. 
I believe Themba Mkhwanazi is going to be here, but I haven't seen him yet, but just to let you know that he should be here. And we also have Tom McCulley. Tom, could you put your hand up? Tom is the leader on the Quellaveco project. He gave the briefing to the Board this week, and certainly from our perspective, thrilled with the progress that's being made. And again, if you've got a minute, I'm sure Tom would love to tell you about his project. He certainly gave the Board and the executive a great summary of where we're up to and very pleasing where it's up to as we stand today. 
To yourselves, thank you for joining us. It's been another important year for Anglo American. It's been a solid year in terms of results as we continue to build on the foundations that we've created over the last few years. We do see continuing upside and obviously the focus in how do we continue to maintain the rate, if you like, or the momentum that we've created. The P101 and  our other operations improvement work is very important to us. We are not yet best of the best. We have improved our competitive position significantly, but there's a lot more we can do, and we remain focused on doing that work. And consistent with that is our improvement in safety, and those 2 pieces go hand-in-hand. 
Our broader technical changes that we introduced in the business have certainly had a big impact, and there's more we can do. And our marketing innovation work is something that doesn't get a lot of airplay, but has been significant. And certainly, as you see, a number of our major competitors starting to restructure their marketing businesses and almost duplicating what we've put in place. It certainly says a lot to Peter and the team, in terms of the work they've done. 
I will talk about FutureSmart a little bit later in my presentation. But again, a lot of people talking about technical innovation and getting the engine room working. And certainly, I think we're hearing a lot of terms that we've been using for a number of years now being thrown around in different parts of the industry. 
And our portfolio enhancement project, we remain committed to disciplined capital, a balanced approach to investments in the business to ensure that we continue to improve margins and returns. And from our point of view, we think that is the key to ensuring that we retain a consistent improvement in our performance over the longer haul. 
Good news and the bad news, diamonds, tough; PGMs, great year. The beauty of being a diversified miner is the quality of the assets that we're able to maintain and develop in the portfolio and the exposure we have to different markets. And again, that strength comes through in what has been a tough year in a couple of commodities, thermal coal, diamonds, but in PGMs, iron ore across the board. I think we saw a 2% improvement in price over the course of the year, but a 9% improvement in performance, which is pointing to both the quality of the portfolio or the diversity of the portfolio and the quality of the assets. 
And then finally, our offer for Sirius is in place. Under takeover rules, I won't be able to say more than I've already said. I will make a few comments. But again, I will be consistent, and we'll be happy to take questions. But as you would expect, we are somewhat constrained in what we can say. And I think people were probably a little bit disappointed in terms of the questions they've asked and what I've said in response to those questions. Nothing new here in terms of our conversations. But I think I should make the point that for us, it's not inconsistent with our strategy. In fact, we think it's absolutely consistent, which is about focus on quality, focus on driving margins and returns over the long term and having a key effect with potentially another great asset to follow that in terms of development works well with all of the things that we've been talking to over the last 5 or 6 years. 
Stephen, can I have the clicker? Yes, sorry. So just to roll through on the agenda. I've gone past the agenda already. Just quickly, I'll do the transformation journey. Stephen will pick up the financials and talk to the numbers, the important bit. I'll talk to the growth and our approach going forward and then how we see ourselves positioned for the future. And I hope continue to help people understand how we see ourselves differentiating in the industry in which we work. 
Again, on the results, margins, effectiveness. And we -- when we talk about the business, we talk about measuring performance in 3 streams. Firstly, effectiveness. As a team, our job, our success is ultimately measured on the cash flow that we deliver from the business, and it's all about cash flow. We do talk to free cash flow, and we talk to sustainable free cash flow, which is cash flow before growth projects. So from our point of view, making sure we've got the balance, but it's about generating cash flow, and that's our effectiveness measure, and we continue to improve the underlying business. 
Measuring the efficiency of those cash flows is our capital return measure, which is return on capital employed, and there are different capital return measures. Each of you use your own. But for us, it's about making sure we're focused on working every dollar as hard as we can, and our threshold return is 15%. Now you'll see this year that we've delivered 19%, which is above the threshold. But we look at those 2 numbers together to understand how well we're doing as a business.  Because at the end of the day, if you're not delivering 15%, then you're starting to get close to value destruction which, at the end of the day means you don't, and you're not creating a sustainable business. 
And then finally, sustainability has a number of dimensions that we talk to, starting from safety, environment, developing people, social performance right the way through to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. And for us, looking at those pillars is as much about the first 2 numbers as making sure that we can deliver those results sustainably. And when we talk about capital allocation, it's about making sure we've got those 3 elements all heading in the same direction. In simple terms, we focus about -- we focus on getting those 3 dimensions right, and that's certainly where we've been from where we started in terms of the transformation journey. 
So to start with some key elements of that sustainability conversation, as Stuart pointed out, we've lost 4 colleagues in the year. And despite it being the best-ever safety performance that we've delivered, no year is a good year if you've lost a colleague. The Elimination of Fatalities' work is absolutely key to the improvements and, ultimately, delivering on that promise of zero harm, but it also touches all other elements of the business. 
Health in our industry, quite frankly, has been an even more difficult issue and a bigger killer than actual safety incidents over the long term. And I'm proud to say, and if you look back at around 2007, we lost over 600 colleagues to HIV/ AIDS-related illnesses. For the first time in the last 30-odd years, the number last year was 0. And that's a remarkable achievement, and it speaks to the lead that Anglo American took in South Africa and on a global basis, in working with its employees and helping people understand what we could do to make a difference, including the first company, first major company that actually provided antiretroviral drugs to employees and their families. And for us, that achievement is as significant as anything we've done, and it speaks to who we are as a company and is very much that purpose conversation that Stuart was talking to. It's one thing to talk about a purpose. It's another thing to live it, and we're certainly focused on living it. 
On environment, we continue to improve. I think the environmental performance reflects the focus on planning, understanding risk and making sure we control those risks. We've still got a lot of work to do within the operations, but in many ways it's a metaphor for the focus the operating model brings and the focus on planning and making sure we're executing the work effectively. 
In terms of transformation, yes, we are a fundamentally transformed business. If you look at where we've come from, you know, most of you know the story, we have focused on the portfolio. Half the assets, we've still grown production by 12% over that period. The thing that's driven that is the technical changes that we've introduced in the assets that we've kept and the underlying efficiency improvements. So the average production from the assets we've retained is 30% higher from where we were back in 2012, '13. As a consequence, our operating costs in real terms have dropped 45% or 29% in nominal terms. And from our perspective, the real challenge going forward is to keep the lid on costs so that we deliver flat or better costs over time. And if we can continue to do that effectively, then we certainly believe margins and returns will continue to grow. And you will see in forecasting forward, where we talk about growing our margins from 40% to 45%, to 45% to 50%, the difference in those 2 numbers is at current prices, we can grow to 45% to 50%
[Technical Difficulty] 
with the focus on operating improvement, improvement in efficiencies through the productivity, doubling of productivity, we've continued to improve our competitive position, which reflects the transformation and the quicker improvement
[Technical Difficulty] 
based on revenue. So we try and get the weighted mix right, and we do that when we measure against our competitors and the data is externally sourced. So we think it's objective. And today -- or last year, based on the first half, we're at 36th percentile. We still haven't got the final year numbers in. But based on what we've seen, we will probably improve a little bit more, but others may also move. So we'll wait and see where the numbers land. But we still remain, from what we can see, on the front edge of our competitive position. And with the diversity of the portfolio, I think we add another dimension that others don't have in terms of thinking about returns and positioning going forward. 
Consistent with that, we've also done a lot of work on the marketing side. So despite the commodity price, and that red squiggly line is our basket price over time, has actually dropped 5% in gross terms. So our growth in margins from 30% to 40% reflects the cost improvements that we've delivered. And with better prices realized for many of our products, we've actually still grown our margins. And again, that's the test of resilience, we call it, in terms of your competitive position and what you can do with margins, and there's still more we can do. 
So with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Otherwise I would have been the butt of the opening joke, I'm sure. 
Listen, good morning, and welcome to everyone. There's 3 key themes that I really want to talk you through this morning before I get stuck and in the numbers. So it's about continuing delivery, and that's really built off the operating model and the productivity that Mark loves to talk to. It's about the increasing margin. So it's realizing the value from that productivity and dropping that to the bottom line. And then also, it's about the disciplined allocation of cash. So it's about the balance, getting the balance sheet right, allocating capital for the existing business, returns to shareholders, and then obviously, setting us up to deliver the next wave of disciplined growth. 
So turning to the numbers themselves. EBITDA, up 9%. What you see in the numbers, as Mark mentioned, is the benefit of owning quality assets and the diversification across the portfolio. So we had strong iron ore prices and PGM prices offsetting the weakness in the diamond midstream and coal prices. A 6% reduction in costs despite the headwinds that we've encountered, and I'll talk about those in a moment; and as Mark mentioned, again some great work from the marketing team. 
EPS, up 8% to $2.75 a share. That drove the 40% payout ratio and a dividend of $1.09 per share. In addition, you'll be aware we announced the USD 1 billion buyback at the half year, and we've progressed that through since then. So CapEx of $3.8 billion, up a little this year with the contribution to Quellaveco and obviously also progress in the Aquila met coal operations and the diamond vessel that we're building for Namibia. So with that, they're up a little bit as expected to $4.6 billion. 
So $10 billion of EBITDA, and we'll do a quick tour around the 4 business units. So diamonds, first of all, as Mark mentioned, a tough year, excess polished inventories in the midstream, some macro uncertainty and also some localized regional events. As the market leader [ TB has ] responded, cut production and provided some relief in terms of pricing. 
Copper, a really solid plant performance, offsetting some of the water challenges at Los Bronces. And then an excellent cost position overall, with C1 costs coming down to $1.26 across the year. 
In PGMs, as I said, EBITDA nearly doubled, significant increase in the basket price. Palladium and rhodium prices have continued in -- to improve into 2020. And that was -- as well, we had about 100,000 platinum ounces roll over from '18 to '19, given some of the load shedding that occurred late in the year. Now we did these calculations I think about midday yesterday, so you'll have to excuse me. They're probably significantly out of date by the time we speak this morning. So with spot prices, clearly, our margin continues to improve, well in excess of 50%, given the basket price is now well in excess of $4,500 per platinum ounce.
Just to give you a sense of the numbers here, that would translate to about $2 billion of platinum revenue, although I noticed that's up significantly overnight, a $4 billion of palladium revenue and about $3.5 billion of rhodium revenue. So you can see the extent those price moves are going to have in terms of cash flow should that continue. 
In terms of Bulks, we benefit from record production at Minas-Rio. At Minas-Rio, a really great performance again from the team, and Kumba recovered through the second half. 
Met coal, great margins there at 43% across the portfolio. Again, a number of moving parts, good iron ore prices, but softer coal, particularly [ Serahan ] reduced production given the weaker European markets. 
So let's have a look at what drives those numbers. So if we work from the left-hand side across to the right, so in terms of macro external factors, broadly in line year-to-year. So currency, CPI and price broadly offset one another. 
We've also just pulled out for you there the impact of diamond's demand that had in terms of the underlying EBITDA. So that's the buildup in the midstream and the combination of lower index prices and the lower quality mix of diamonds, and therefore the lower volumes that De Beers put into the marketplace. 
The last couple of slides, we have seen some early signs of recovery, but I would stress it's early. And obviously, the coronavirus provides some uncertainty just as we go through the first half of this year. 
On the controllable side, a decent improvement, $600 million in all, largely driven by the Minas-Rio recovery versus the 2017 production. And we also had a $0.4 billion of other cost and volume benefits, but they were offset to provide net $0.1 billion, given the water at Los Bronces for load shedding in PGMs and the loss of the domestic sales towards the end of the year in Kumba. 
Turning to the balance sheet - if I can just find my page. Turning to the balance sheet. Again, I'm going to really reiterate some of the messages that we've been speaking really consistently about over the last couple of years. So it's about balance, it's about balance sheet strength and discipline so that we can consistently deliver period after period and also drive some of those value-adding growth opportunities over time. Net debt was up as expected. Quellaveco stepped up, in total $1.3 billion for the year. And also, we had the change in IFRS, in the finance standards accounting, which brought about $0.5 billion of leases onto the balance sheet. 
Just to point out as well that $4.6 billion does include about $300 million of Mitsubishi debt that we consolidate onto our balance sheet, given the control. 
The 2 other balance sheet metrics that are really important, the 0.5 net debt-to-EBITDA, very comfortable, well within our guidance, and net gearing at a very healthy 13%. Again, a real commitment to ongoing capital discipline so that we do provide that flexibility in the balance sheet should we need it. 
A key part of our thinking is clearly returns to shareholders. Dividend policy of 40% payout resulted in the dividends this year, $1.4 billion in total paid, an average yield of 5% across 2019. This was supplemented by a $1 billion buyback program that we announced at the half year. As of today, we're about $950 million roughly through that buyback program. And consistent with our disclosure, we'd expect to complete that by the end of March. 
Our 40% payout policy will continue through 2020 and '21. As per our normal considerations, if we were to generate excess cash, we will run that through our normal capital allocation considerations. Part of those considerations is that we would always assess whether we would return excess cash to shareholders through either a buyback or special dividend, and there's no change in that respect. 
So how did we go in terms of that capital allocation framework across the year? We generated sustainable free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year. We have spoken about net debt, and as I say, very pleased with where we are on the balance sheet. We started to allocate more capital to discretionary options because we have got the balance sheet to where we wanted to get it. So that was the $1 billion in terms of the buyback, at which, by December, we'd spent [ $900 ] million and then $1.1 billion in terms of gross spend. And I should be aware, the majority of that in terms of the Quellaveco project. 
So really, we think where we've got that again, balanced approach to how we're thinking about capital allocation and cash flow. Just to be clear too, you'll see on that bottom left-hand side, the Sirius would be part of our consideration in terms of how we allocate discretionary cash flow. So very clearly part of our thinking in terms of portfolio upgrade. 
So looking forward, in terms of CapEx, effectively the same guidance that we gave you back in December. There's a step-up in CapEx for 2020 as we hit peak CapEx year for Quellaveco. The numbers there do exclude anything in terms of Sirius. Obviously, still subject to the ongoing offer. Sirius had indicated, and we are comfortable that -- with their proposed $0.3 billion over the next 2 years as part of their revised development schedule. Importantly, that would mean we're not really focused on heavy cash flow on 2 greenfield projects; at the same time that would nicely sequence itself post Quellaveco spin. 
So also looking forward in terms of our $3 billion to $4 billion target. So we set that target just as a reminder from the start of '18 through to the end of '22. And as we've consistently said, some of that will be back-end weighted as we deliver particularly the tech dev and the projects. To date, we've delivered $0.5 billion. We're comfortable that our improvement run rate that we're seeing and our equipment performance is in excess of that. Some of that will come through over time as it gets released from working capital and flows through the system. And some of it, in this second half in particular, has been eaten up a little bit by some of those headwinds that I spoke about: water, load shedding, et cetera. But it's our job to make sure that we give that value visibility and getting all parts of our business to operate at those same run rates so that we see that value drop to the bottom line. 
For 2020, we've identified further improvements of $0.4 billion -- no pressure, Natascha -- but partly driven by improved performance in the smelting and refining at Kumba -- sorry, at PGMs -- and a little bit of a turnaround in consistency of performance at Kumba. Remember, they had a few maintenance issues early last year. 
We have seen no -- as most of you would be aware, we had a roof collapse at Moranbah in January. Importantly, no one was hurt in that process, so the team did a great job. We were in the middle of a longwall move, and that will now take us about 8 weeks longer than what was originally planned. So we will lose around 2 million tonnes of production for Moranbah. However, we will try to make some of that up from Grosvenor, and obviously, we've got the balance of the year to really try to outperform to get that back. That results in about a $0.2 billion impact on EBITDA. And you will notice, if you've had a chance to look at the guidance, we've adjusted our guidance on met coal production for the year by about that sum. 
So looking at the 3 categories. Again, operating model P101, strong performance but partly offset. The tech dev, we continue to work on the program, we're rolling out the initiative. The benefits will largely come through in '21 and '22. And again, just to give you a flavor of that, the ore sorter at El Soldado is in and running. I think it's the second half this year the ore processing -- sorry, the coarse particle flotation circuit will be in. And then we're also putting in the ore sorters at Mogalakwena and Barro Alto as we speak. So you should start to see some of those benefits flow through. 
Mark will touch on the growth projects in a moment, but all on time and on budget, and they obviously contribute through, I've said, towards the end of that '22 period. 
So just before I hand back to Mark, once again, fully committed to the balanced approach of running a strong balance sheet, flexibility through the cycle so that we can focus and create on long-term value for not only our shareholders but all of our stakeholders. We'll continue with attractive returns and balance as we think about those returns to shareholders, as we try to look after both today's cash flow and the generation of tomorrow's cash flows. So a disciplined, value-adding approach. 
Mark mentioned the long-term EBITDA margin target, so I won't go into that again. But we do believe that we've got some upside still to flow through that as we deliver those underlying improvements in the business so that we get an increased sustainable margin, both at spot prices and at long-term consensus pricing. 
Mark, back to you."

Last 10 games though, they've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier league. So those other Watford supporters, Duncan, you can commiserate. 
Disciplined growth. So where to next? The first point I'd like to make in the conversation around  growth, it's not simply about top line growth. When we talk growth, it's about growing value. And so there, for us, it's growing top line revenues and it's about growing margins in particular. And so for us, growth is about growing cash flow and growing returns. And I obviously touched something there -- oops, there we go. 
So for us, it's about sustainable free cash flow and returns, and that's really the key part of our focus. Well, that's really where the focus is for us as a group. 
Okay. In terms of projects, Quellaveco, doing well, on time, on budget, very pleased with the progress we've seen. And again, I'd invite you to have a quick chat to Tom while he's here. Again, the complexities, and there are political complexities in all of the jurisdictions that the mining industry operates, but I think we've navigated those extremely well. And the local community relationships are exceptional. And for Peru, if you can get those relationships right, it's a key to being successful in the country. And so I think the team has done a good job, and we're very pleased with the progress so far. 
In terms of De Beers, with the new boat going -- is it a ship or a boat, Bruce? It's a ship. Stuart is going to kick me for even asking the question. Very happy with the progress, and the team has done a great job in working with the manufacturers, and I think they're doing very well in time. Just to remind you, the quality of the diamonds from the marine projects is very high. It's around $500 a carat. And so it really does add quality and margin again to De Beers' work, and a very important one for us. 
Aquila met coal going very well, decline, a pretty straightforward operation, but an important one that picks up where Grasstree will finish off with its life. So very pleased with progress right across the board. And certainly, [ a 2-path ] growth engine seems to be going very well, and we've got a number of things still to come through Moranbah-Grosvenor that Stephen's talked about. 
In terms of Sirius, I will stick closer to my script. It is a quality asset. We've talked about the polyhalite resource being a very different type of product, multinutrient, low chloride, low cost. It's a product that will travel. And certainly the feedback we've had when we've done our due diligence work has been very positive. And in particular, the form that the product comes in is very important in terms of the value proposition. So we think it has good potential. Obviously, there's still a lot more work to do. And taking all those factors into account, we think the offer that we have is fair and reasonable, and it's taken all of those issues into proper account. 
The only other point I would make is we still have a way to go. There still is a vote from shareholders required, and all we ask is that shareholders take note of the Chairman's statement in the documentation regarding their recommendation in terms of the Anglo offer. And so from our perspective, it's a work [ that's ] in progress, still a long way to go. And again, we encourage those shareholders to look at the statement from the Chairman and the directors in terms of the Anglo proposition that is currently sitting before them. 
In terms of the future and how we think about the business, it is very much about quality assets. And again, our conversation around Sirius fits into that conversation, as we do see there's a potential Tier 1 asset. And for us, we think that our focus in terms of what we've been doing with the portfolio, with the portfolio on a broader basis is consistent with those themes. We are continuing to shape the portfolio on the basis of a quality asset in markets that we think have potential strong pricing fundamentals and, from our perspective, something that we understand and we believe we can do well in. 
Our business model and the way we invest across the value chain is fundamentally different to our competitors'. Our business model is a very different business model to a trading model or a logistics model. It is about understanding what we do from mine through to customer and consumer, and making sure that we're investing in leverage points across the value chain. And that is a different approach. That approach has been absolutely clear as a bell, obviously in De Beers. But our investment in platinum and the profile we've taken in the PGM industry is unique as well, and the work on venture capital in helping promote uses of platinum and other materials in terms of the hydrogen economy is how we differentiate ourselves in the way we think about our business and the models we're creating. 
In terms of FutureSmart mining, when we talk about carbon neutrality or we talk about the way the mining industry needs to look in 5, 10, 20 years, we've been in a strategic conversation for 6 years. FutureSmart mining is about changing the way mining is carried out so that we can ultimately get to carbon neutrality, that we can ultimately reduce our footprint and connect ourselves to local community in a very different way compared to what we've done as an industry in the past. Our regional collaborative development model is unique. GemFair, working with our traditional miners and government to change the nature of mining is strategic, it's different. And we understand in some cases, people struggle with some of the things we're doing. But as each day goes by, what we're doing makes more sense to those that talk ESG. It's not about talking, it's about walking. And we're proud to say that in the last 3 or 4 weeks with the publishing of the Responsibility Index, which is walk versus talk, we've come up as the top resources company. Now the challenge is to continue walking and leading the industry and the changes that we've talked to. And those conversations will lead us -- and those approaches will lead us in terms of how we profile the business in terms of Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 positions. But anything we talk to, any target we set will be based on the way we believe we should be transforming the business. It will have substance behind it. That's an important point. And for us, FutureSmart is the substance behind the conversation, and we've been there for 6 years. 
And putting all those pieces together, it's about people. We've built and developed, we think, an exceptional team across the business. We continue to evolve the business. And from our perspective, it's about people and about making sure we've got the right people in the right roles. And so we believe that, that will always be a works in progress, but it is again a defining position for us in the industry. 
On asset portfolio, again Stephen, I think, said it well, a clip on diamonds and in PGMs, we are industry leaders. We take that leadership role seriously in terms of the way we talk to our industry, the way we talk to our products, the way we interface with both customers and consumers, and we understand the difference between the 2 and how we're developing our business for the longer term. Clearly, Bruce and his team are doing a lot of work in rethinking and reimagining the way diamond should be taken forward, and we're looking at every part of the value chain in terms of how it can make a more significant contribution in driving long-term value. Very important piece for us. And Chris has done the same in the PGM industry. 
Our high-quality bulks are unique in terms of quality. And for us, we've been positioning in that business the way we have for some years. We've taken Kumba's product from about 62%, 63% to 64.5% on the basis that we believe the market will reward quality, consistency and the relationship that we create in our markets and put that with our marketing work, again, a unique positioning in the industry. 
And with copper, nickel and other products we produce, again a -- very much a future-facing portfolio, which we think is very much a differentiating factor in terms of the future and ultimately, we think future returns. 
Our investment proposition, again, is based on competitive assets, and you've seen our improvement in competitive position. We have built a differentiated set of capabilities. We've been thinking strategically from day 1 in terms of our transformation. How do we create a company that leads the industry in the way it thinks about how it services society and delivers the products the right way and in a way that are valued by society in terms of what we bring to the conversation? And those footprints and the work we're doing is consistent with that differentiated set of capabilities. A lot of people now are talking about focus on technical, focusing on operating capacities, we've been there for 6 years. 
And then finally, in terms of returns. When Stephen talks about balance, it is about discipline in capital allocation, investing in the right things and making sure the business is sustainable in every sense of the word. So whether it's a safety conversation or whether it's a growth conversation or whether it's a competitive cost position, it's all about building a sustainable business. And by that, we mean delivering sustainable returns and improving returns to our shareholders. 
So with that, Stephen and I would be thrilled to take your questions."

Just 2 questions, if I may. 
Firstly, just on capital allocation. Stephen, you obviously gave us a nice sort of pie chart, and that is on a consolidated basis. But if you look at the ex South African net debt, that went up from about 8.5  -- I think another $400 million, $500 million up. So you were essentially buying back from debt. Could you give us an idea of the split just between how much you bought back in South Africa and in -- outside of South Africa? And obviously, you've said in the past, that does matter. I mean, with CapEx now rising, do you think it's -- there's room for more buybacks down the line? I mean, obviously, cash flow generation is very strong. A lot of that is in South Africa. So maybe just how you think about that? 
And then secondly, just on diamonds. You've obviously kept your guidance at 32 to 34. So that's roughly, let's say, 2 million to 3 million carats additional supply this year versus last year. You also have, let's say, $400 million or $500 million of inventory that you're looking to sell down this year. Do you think, given the environment with the coronavirus and Alrosa are looking to destock by 4 million, 5 million carats, it's appropriate to still maintain that? Or was it more you'll see how things go and adjust when appropriate?"

So I suppose we kept that fairly constant. 
Remembering also that we have the majority of those South African dollars held in U.S. dollars in London. And so at year-end, we actually had very limited local currency in South Africa.

On the Amplats, I think if you looked at both Amplats and Kumba, they've done extremely well. And I would argue that you've got the 2 best investment stories in South Africa by a country mile, and people are investing in a great story. 
I would argue that the Anglo American global story is just as exciting, but we've probably got a much broader pool that we're playing in. And over time, we've experienced those things tend to normalize out. So I think it's the normal ebb and flow we see in terms of differences. 
Our job at Anglo is to keep growing the business in terms of margins and cash flow. And where we were trading maybe at a 40% discount a year or 2 ago, we're at about 19% discount. If we keep closing that gap and deliver a 30-odd percent return to shareholders, at some point people start switching their money on a broader basis. And our appeal to generalists, we think, is something that could quite materially change how people look at us. So we're focused on the big guide, the longer-term guide and the fact that we've got assets making a great contribution, it's a bigger story. Copper, the whole story is, in our view, the main gun, okay? 
Quellaveco. Look, the guys are doing a good job. On paper, we're doing extremely well. But I've been around this industry for 43 years. I've run major projects. You can lose the gains very quickly. And so from our point of view, we'd like to see a little bit more time and finish off -- we'd like to see the concrete finished in the mill, in particular, because we've still got, what, 60-odd thousand tonnes of concrete to place in the mill [ tun ]. So before I start flapping my gums and looking too excited, I'd like to see that done. So -- but we're making good progress. There is no doubt on the technical aspects, we're doing extremely well. But communities, we're interfacing with a lot of people. You want to make sure that you get a little further into the project before you start making extravagant claims in terms of where you are.

Interesting to see the platinum price start to jump around a little bit as well. So we'll see what that actually means. But from our point of view, we're investing in the right things. We've made it very clear that we're pushing along with Mogalakwena. Not exactly sure what the final outcome at Mogalakwena will be, but for our point of view, that's a priority project.

And if I could use the description, an automobile CEO won't get fired for spending $50 per car extra on PGMs, but they might get fired for not meeting their emission targets. So the demand is real. We've seen increases in consumption per car, particularly in China, as they've tightened the limits. So these are real demand trends. The question for us is more around, will there be some switching? Because don't forget, palladium is very important in terms of [ being the ] heat source in the car, whereas platinum is more effective further down the process. 
So there are some technical questions. The real question is, how long will the technical people take and what can they do to maybe shift the use of platinum, palladium and rhodium around? Rhodium is used for a whole range of things. So the world is short rhodium clearly at the moment. And I'm not sure there's a lot more coming on in the near term. So it's in a pretty good position. Platinum, I still think will be a beneficiary, but it might take a little bit longer. 
In terms of Mogalakwena, to get it into 2 parts, you've got 1/3 are a new concentrator, which would be certainly in the 1 billion to 1.5 billion type range, but you've also then got the technical type solutions where it might be ore sorting and a whole range of incremental capital options that give you a far better return.

Again, just about capital discipline. We're not going to rush out, as Mark said, just because we have a high price today. We want to make the right long-term decisions in how we spend that capital. 
On the overall CapEx question, a couple of points to make. Obviously, as we deliver Quellaveco, Moranbah-Grosvenor brownfield, the new ship in Namibia, we'll be generating additional cash flows from all of those businesses as well as additional cash flows from the underlying business, given the improvements that we're focused on. So the business will be, I think, in quite a different place in the next couple of years. 
Could we have a sequence then of other capital projects without preempting any decision? Potentially so. But obviously, each of those decisions will be made in their own right based on meeting metrics, based on a view of markets, not just for the now, but for the longer term. So how that plays out, we'll have to wait and see how markets develop. But potentially, we could have some internal options in front of us.

We're also looking at something in the Northern Cape. We've had discussions with the various ministers in South Africa, very supportive of those types of options. Their main point is that they are not keen to see people selling back into grid. So you do a self-contained system, which works perfectly for what we want to do because we would use excess capacity to generate hydrogen so that we continue to decarbonize on a much broader footprint.

I'd love to see that flow out but ultimately, it will depend a little bit on market conditions just as to the time that, that may take. 
We also had a little bit of inventory build or not as much inventory runoff as we would have liked in platinum. So again, I'd love to see some of that run down. 
It's a different mix between the 2. In De Beers, it's really held as finished goods ready to go. In platinum, it's held as, largely as work-in-progress. So getting it through the last phases of the processing plant is really important in that part of the business. And so I'd love to see that perhaps come back towards normal levels again. 
On Los Bronces, I'm not sure I can add too much more to the guidance that we've given. We've given a production range, as Ruben said, of that 620 to 670. That's really around water. So depending on how that plays out over the year, we've had a reasonably good start and we're trying to recover as much water as we can to maximize the volume. We're just going to have to keep you posted.

It's my pleasure as the Chairman of Anglo American to welcome you to our 2019 full year results presentation. I want to cover 2 things in brief before I hand over to Mark and Stephen, who will take us through the presentation. 
And firstly, as an enterprise we have a very clear purpose, which is to reengineer mining to improve people's lives, improve people's lives, all people, our employees and contractors who work in our organizations, but also all of our other stakeholders, and including, of course, the billions of people who live on this planet and who go about their daily lives, consuming directly and indirectly a lot of the products that we make available. Now there are a lot of things that we need to concentrate on, to improve in order to live that purpose. But there is one screamingly obvious one, of course, and that is our target of zero harm for the employees and contractors who work for us day in, day out. 
And as you're going to hear from Mark shortly, very unfortunately last year, 4 of our employees through our contractors lost their lives going about their work in our managed operations. And Mark will give you some more detail beyond that. That's tough, right? Now that is the best-ever performance, but that is scant comfort for the families of those 4. And I think that what's really important is to understand that improve people's lives when you ended 4 is a constant vigil. 
Now what comfort can we take? We can take comfort from the fact that, again, last year, year-on-year, we improved the important underlying safety measures of performance that we have on a kind of historic basis. So that's good news. And secondly, the work streams, all of the work streams of The Elimination of Fatalities Taskforce that was kicked off in earnest about 18 months ago, properly in earnest to redouble our efforts have all progressed really, really well. So we're happy we're doing the right things, we're happy we're on the path, but we have got a long way to go. And please be assured that the Board of the company, of Anglo American, are very serious about this. 
The second and last subject I wanted to cover was since July, when I presented last time, we've had 2 more Board changes. And I just want you to join me in welcoming our 2 new nonexecutive directors to the Board, both from South Africa. Hixonia Nyasulu, who joined in November of last year; and Nonkululeko Nyembezi, who joined last month. So welcome to them. Other than that, the Board is as it was. 
Let me now hand over to Mark and Stephen, and initially Mark, to take us through last year."

Ladies and gentlemen, what I'd like to do is just point you to -- you each have one of these on your chairs, which is what to do in the case of an emergency. There are no drills scheduled for this morning, so you shouldn't, one hopes, need. But in the event we do, can you make sure you've got that in your hand and follow the processes that have been outlined? Very important. Thank you. 
Again, just for me to acknowledge colleagues, Stuart, thank you for the opening. Colleagues, please take the opportunity to talk to people. I know some of you already have this morning. Most importantly, we have Chris Griffith with us today. Chris has flown in from South Africa overnight. As you are aware, Chris informed all of us of his intention to step down. And what I would like to say and acknowledge Chris for the wonderful contribution he's made to Anglo American over the last 30 years. 
And if I could make a special observation consistent with the Chairman's observation. For the first time in our history in the PGMs business, 0 fatality in our operations. And for those that understand, we are still a deep underground miner. It's a remarkable achievement. And from me, Chris, congratulations. 
We also have announced this morning -- or Anglo Platinum has announced this morning the appointment of Natascha Viljoen to replace Chris. Natascha is with us this morning. So welcome, Natascha. Big boots to fill, but we've known Natascha for about -- for almost 6 years now at Anglo, and she's made a tremendous contribution in her time in the group, and looking forward to the contribution that she will make in terms of the future of the business. 
I believe Themba Mkhwanazi is going to be here, but I haven't seen him yet, but just to let you know that he should be here. And we also have Tom McCulley. Tom, could you put your hand up? Tom is the leader on the Quellaveco project. He gave the briefing to the Board this week, and certainly from our perspective, thrilled with the progress that's being made. And again, if you've got a minute, I'm sure Tom would love to tell you about his project. He certainly gave the Board and the executive a great summary of where we're up to and very pleasing where it's up to as we stand today. 
To yourselves, thank you for joining us. It's been another important year for Anglo American. It's been a solid year in terms of results as we continue to build on the foundations that we've created over the last few years. We do see continuing upside and obviously the focus in how do we continue to maintain the rate, if you like, or the momentum that we've created. The P101 and  our other operations improvement work is very important to us. We are not yet best of the best. We have improved our competitive position significantly, but there's a lot more we can do, and we remain focused on doing that work. And consistent with that is our improvement in safety, and those 2 pieces go hand-in-hand. 
Our broader technical changes that we introduced in the business have certainly had a big impact, and there's more we can do. And our marketing innovation work is something that doesn't get a lot of airplay, but has been significant. And certainly, as you see, a number of our major competitors starting to restructure their marketing businesses and almost duplicating what we've put in place. It certainly says a lot to Peter and the team, in terms of the work they've done. 
I will talk about FutureSmart a little bit later in my presentation. But again, a lot of people talking about technical innovation and getting the engine room working. And certainly, I think we're hearing a lot of terms that we've been using for a number of years now being thrown around in different parts of the industry. 
And our portfolio enhancement project, we remain committed to disciplined capital, a balanced approach to investments in the business to ensure that we continue to improve margins and returns. And from our point of view, we think that is the key to ensuring that we retain a consistent improvement in our performance over the longer haul. 
Good news and the bad news, diamonds, tough; PGMs, great year. The beauty of being a diversified miner is the quality of the assets that we're able to maintain and develop in the portfolio and the exposure we have to different markets. And again, that strength comes through in what has been a tough year in a couple of commodities, thermal coal, diamonds, but in PGMs, iron ore across the board. I think we saw a 2% improvement in price over the course of the year, but a 9% improvement in performance, which is pointing to both the quality of the portfolio or the diversity of the portfolio and the quality of the assets. 
And then finally, our offer for Sirius is in place. Under takeover rules, I won't be able to say more than I've already said. I will make a few comments. But again, I will be consistent, and we'll be happy to take questions. But as you would expect, we are somewhat constrained in what we can say. And I think people were probably a little bit disappointed in terms of the questions they've asked and what I've said in response to those questions. Nothing new here in terms of our conversations. But I think I should make the point that for us, it's not inconsistent with our strategy. In fact, we think it's absolutely consistent, which is about focus on quality, focus on driving margins and returns over the long term and having a key effect with potentially another great asset to follow that in terms of development works well with all of the things that we've been talking to over the last 5 or 6 years. 
Stephen, can I have the clicker? Yes, sorry. So just to roll through on the agenda. I've gone past the agenda already. Just quickly, I'll do the transformation journey. Stephen will pick up the financials and talk to the numbers, the important bit. I'll talk to the growth and our approach going forward and then how we see ourselves positioned for the future. And I hope continue to help people understand how we see ourselves differentiating in the industry in which we work. 
Again, on the results, margins, effectiveness. And we -- when we talk about the business, we talk about measuring performance in 3 streams. Firstly, effectiveness. As a team, our job, our success is ultimately measured on the cash flow that we deliver from the business, and it's all about cash flow. We do talk to free cash flow, and we talk to sustainable free cash flow, which is cash flow before growth projects. So from our point of view, making sure we've got the balance, but it's about generating cash flow, and that's our effectiveness measure, and we continue to improve the underlying business. 
Measuring the efficiency of those cash flows is our capital return measure, which is return on capital employed, and there are different capital return measures. Each of you use your own. But for us, it's about making sure we're focused on working every dollar as hard as we can, and our threshold return is 15%. Now you'll see this year that we've delivered 19%, which is above the threshold. But we look at those 2 numbers together to understand how well we're doing as a business.  Because at the end of the day, if you're not delivering 15%, then you're starting to get close to value destruction which, at the end of the day means you don't, and you're not creating a sustainable business. 
And then finally, sustainability has a number of dimensions that we talk to, starting from safety, environment, developing people, social performance right the way through to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. And for us, looking at those pillars is as much about the first 2 numbers as making sure that we can deliver those results sustainably. And when we talk about capital allocation, it's about making sure we've got those 3 elements all heading in the same direction. In simple terms, we focus about -- we focus on getting those 3 dimensions right, and that's certainly where we've been from where we started in terms of the transformation journey. 
So to start with some key elements of that sustainability conversation, as Stuart pointed out, we've lost 4 colleagues in the year. And despite it being the best-ever safety performance that we've delivered, no year is a good year if you've lost a colleague. The Elimination of Fatalities' work is absolutely key to the improvements and, ultimately, delivering on that promise of zero harm, but it also touches all other elements of the business. 
Health in our industry, quite frankly, has been an even more difficult issue and a bigger killer than actual safety incidents over the long term. And I'm proud to say, and if you look back at around 2007, we lost over 600 colleagues to HIV/ AIDS-related illnesses. For the first time in the last 30-odd years, the number last year was 0. And that's a remarkable achievement, and it speaks to the lead that Anglo American took in South Africa and on a global basis, in working with its employees and helping people understand what we could do to make a difference, including the first company, first major company that actually provided antiretroviral drugs to employees and their families. And for us, that achievement is as significant as anything we've done, and it speaks to who we are as a company and is very much that purpose conversation that Stuart was talking to. It's one thing to talk about a purpose. It's another thing to live it, and we're certainly focused on living it. 
On environment, we continue to improve. I think the environmental performance reflects the focus on planning, understanding risk and making sure we control those risks. We've still got a lot of work to do within the operations, but in many ways it's a metaphor for the focus the operating model brings and the focus on planning and making sure we're executing the work effectively. 
In terms of transformation, yes, we are a fundamentally transformed business. If you look at where we've come from, you know, most of you know the story, we have focused on the portfolio. Half the assets, we've still grown production by 12% over that period. The thing that's driven that is the technical changes that we've introduced in the assets that we've kept and the underlying efficiency improvements. So the average production from the assets we've retained is 30% higher from where we were back in 2012, '13. As a consequence, our operating costs in real terms have dropped 45% or 29% in nominal terms. And from our perspective, the real challenge going forward is to keep the lid on costs so that we deliver flat or better costs over time. And if we can continue to do that effectively, then we certainly believe margins and returns will continue to grow. And you will see in forecasting forward, where we talk about growing our margins from 40% to 45%, to 45% to 50%, the difference in those 2 numbers is at current prices, we can grow to 45% to 50%
[Technical Difficulty] 
with the focus on operating improvement, improvement in efficiencies through the productivity, doubling of productivity, we've continued to improve our competitive position, which reflects the transformation and the quicker improvement
[Technical Difficulty] 
based on revenue. So we try and get the weighted mix right, and we do that when we measure against our competitors and the data is externally sourced. So we think it's objective. And today -- or last year, based on the first half, we're at 36th percentile. We still haven't got the final year numbers in. But based on what we've seen, we will probably improve a little bit more, but others may also move. So we'll wait and see where the numbers land. But we still remain, from what we can see, on the front edge of our competitive position. And with the diversity of the portfolio, I think we add another dimension that others don't have in terms of thinking about returns and positioning going forward. 
Consistent with that, we've also done a lot of work on the marketing side. So despite the commodity price, and that red squiggly line is our basket price over time, has actually dropped 5% in gross terms. So our growth in margins from 30% to 40% reflects the cost improvements that we've delivered. And with better prices realized for many of our products, we've actually still grown our margins. And again, that's the test of resilience, we call it, in terms of your competitive position and what you can do with margins, and there's still more we can do. 
So with that, I'll hand across to Stephen."

Otherwise I would have been the butt of the opening joke, I'm sure. 
Listen, good morning, and welcome to everyone. There's 3 key themes that I really want to talk you through this morning before I get stuck and in the numbers. So it's about continuing delivery, and that's really built off the operating model and the productivity that Mark loves to talk to. It's about the increasing margin. So it's realizing the value from that productivity and dropping that to the bottom line. And then also, it's about the disciplined allocation of cash. So it's about the balance, getting the balance sheet right, allocating capital for the existing business, returns to shareholders, and then obviously, setting us up to deliver the next wave of disciplined growth. 
So turning to the numbers themselves. EBITDA, up 9%. What you see in the numbers, as Mark mentioned, is the benefit of owning quality assets and the diversification across the portfolio. So we had strong iron ore prices and PGM prices offsetting the weakness in the diamond midstream and coal prices. A 6% reduction in costs despite the headwinds that we've encountered, and I'll talk about those in a moment; and as Mark mentioned, again some great work from the marketing team. 
EPS, up 8% to $2.75 a share. That drove the 40% payout ratio and a dividend of $1.09 per share. In addition, you'll be aware we announced the USD 1 billion buyback at the half year, and we've progressed that through since then. So CapEx of $3.8 billion, up a little this year with the contribution to Quellaveco and obviously also progress in the Aquila met coal operations and the diamond vessel that we're building for Namibia. So with that, they're up a little bit as expected to $4.6 billion. 
So $10 billion of EBITDA, and we'll do a quick tour around the 4 business units. So diamonds, first of all, as Mark mentioned, a tough year, excess polished inventories in the midstream, some macro uncertainty and also some localized regional events. As the market leader [ TB has ] responded, cut production and provided some relief in terms of pricing. 
Copper, a really solid plant performance, offsetting some of the water challenges at Los Bronces. And then an excellent cost position overall, with C1 costs coming down to $1.26 across the year. 
In PGMs, as I said, EBITDA nearly doubled, significant increase in the basket price. Palladium and rhodium prices have continued in -- to improve into 2020. And that was -- as well, we had about 100,000 platinum ounces roll over from '18 to '19, given some of the load shedding that occurred late in the year. Now we did these calculations I think about midday yesterday, so you'll have to excuse me. They're probably significantly out of date by the time we speak this morning. So with spot prices, clearly, our margin continues to improve, well in excess of 50%, given the basket price is now well in excess of $4,500 per platinum ounce.
Just to give you a sense of the numbers here, that would translate to about $2 billion of platinum revenue, although I noticed that's up significantly overnight, a $4 billion of palladium revenue and about $3.5 billion of rhodium revenue. So you can see the extent those price moves are going to have in terms of cash flow should that continue. 
In terms of Bulks, we benefit from record production at Minas-Rio. At Minas-Rio, a really great performance again from the team, and Kumba recovered through the second half. 
Met coal, great margins there at 43% across the portfolio. Again, a number of moving parts, good iron ore prices, but softer coal, particularly [ Serahan ] reduced production given the weaker European markets. 
So let's have a look at what drives those numbers. So if we work from the left-hand side across to the right, so in terms of macro external factors, broadly in line year-to-year. So currency, CPI and price broadly offset one another. 
We've also just pulled out for you there the impact of diamond's demand that had in terms of the underlying EBITDA. So that's the buildup in the midstream and the combination of lower index prices and the lower quality mix of diamonds, and therefore the lower volumes that De Beers put into the marketplace. 
The last couple of slides, we have seen some early signs of recovery, but I would stress it's early. And obviously, the coronavirus provides some uncertainty just as we go through the first half of this year. 
On the controllable side, a decent improvement, $600 million in all, largely driven by the Minas-Rio recovery versus the 2017 production. And we also had a $0.4 billion of other cost and volume benefits, but they were offset to provide net $0.1 billion, given the water at Los Bronces for load shedding in PGMs and the loss of the domestic sales towards the end of the year in Kumba. 
Turning to the balance sheet - if I can just find my page. Turning to the balance sheet. Again, I'm going to really reiterate some of the messages that we've been speaking really consistently about over the last couple of years. So it's about balance, it's about balance sheet strength and discipline so that we can consistently deliver period after period and also drive some of those value-adding growth opportunities over time. Net debt was up as expected. Quellaveco stepped up, in total $1.3 billion for the year. And also, we had the change in IFRS, in the finance standards accounting, which brought about $0.5 billion of leases onto the balance sheet. 
Just to point out as well that $4.6 billion does include about $300 million of Mitsubishi debt that we consolidate onto our balance sheet, given the control. 
The 2 other balance sheet metrics that are really important, the 0.5 net debt-to-EBITDA, very comfortable, well within our guidance, and net gearing at a very healthy 13%. Again, a real commitment to ongoing capital discipline so that we do provide that flexibility in the balance sheet should we need it. 
A key part of our thinking is clearly returns to shareholders. Dividend policy of 40% payout resulted in the dividends this year, $1.4 billion in total paid, an average yield of 5% across 2019. This was supplemented by a $1 billion buyback program that we announced at the half year. As of today, we're about $950 million roughly through that buyback program. And consistent with our disclosure, we'd expect to complete that by the end of March. 
Our 40% payout policy will continue through 2020 and '21. As per our normal considerations, if we were to generate excess cash, we will run that through our normal capital allocation considerations. Part of those considerations is that we would always assess whether we would return excess cash to shareholders through either a buyback or special dividend, and there's no change in that respect. 
So how did we go in terms of that capital allocation framework across the year? We generated sustainable free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year. We have spoken about net debt, and as I say, very pleased with where we are on the balance sheet. We started to allocate more capital to discretionary options because we have got the balance sheet to where we wanted to get it. So that was the $1 billion in terms of the buyback, at which, by December, we'd spent [ $900 ] million and then $1.1 billion in terms of gross spend. And I should be aware, the majority of that in terms of the Quellaveco project. 
So really, we think where we've got that again, balanced approach to how we're thinking about capital allocation and cash flow. Just to be clear too, you'll see on that bottom left-hand side, the Sirius would be part of our consideration in terms of how we allocate discretionary cash flow. So very clearly part of our thinking in terms of portfolio upgrade. 
So looking forward, in terms of CapEx, effectively the same guidance that we gave you back in December. There's a step-up in CapEx for 2020 as we hit peak CapEx year for Quellaveco. The numbers there do exclude anything in terms of Sirius. Obviously, still subject to the ongoing offer. Sirius had indicated, and we are comfortable that -- with their proposed $0.3 billion over the next 2 years as part of their revised development schedule. Importantly, that would mean we're not really focused on heavy cash flow on 2 greenfield projects; at the same time that would nicely sequence itself post Quellaveco spin. 
So also looking forward in terms of our $3 billion to $4 billion target. So we set that target just as a reminder from the start of '18 through to the end of '22. And as we've consistently said, some of that will be back-end weighted as we deliver particularly the tech dev and the projects. To date, we've delivered $0.5 billion. We're comfortable that our improvement run rate that we're seeing and our equipment performance is in excess of that. Some of that will come through over time as it gets released from working capital and flows through the system. And some of it, in this second half in particular, has been eaten up a little bit by some of those headwinds that I spoke about: water, load shedding, et cetera. But it's our job to make sure that we give that value visibility and getting all parts of our business to operate at those same run rates so that we see that value drop to the bottom line. 
For 2020, we've identified further improvements of $0.4 billion -- no pressure, Natascha -- but partly driven by improved performance in the smelting and refining at Kumba -- sorry, at PGMs -- and a little bit of a turnaround in consistency of performance at Kumba. Remember, they had a few maintenance issues early last year. 
We have seen no -- as most of you would be aware, we had a roof collapse at Moranbah in January. Importantly, no one was hurt in that process, so the team did a great job. We were in the middle of a longwall move, and that will now take us about 8 weeks longer than what was originally planned. So we will lose around 2 million tonnes of production for Moranbah. However, we will try to make some of that up from Grosvenor, and obviously, we've got the balance of the year to really try to outperform to get that back. That results in about a $0.2 billion impact on EBITDA. And you will notice, if you've had a chance to look at the guidance, we've adjusted our guidance on met coal production for the year by about that sum. 
So looking at the 3 categories. Again, operating model P101, strong performance but partly offset. The tech dev, we continue to work on the program, we're rolling out the initiative. The benefits will largely come through in '21 and '22. And again, just to give you a flavor of that, the ore sorter at El Soldado is in and running. I think it's the second half this year the ore processing -- sorry, the coarse particle flotation circuit will be in. And then we're also putting in the ore sorters at Mogalakwena and Barro Alto as we speak. So you should start to see some of those benefits flow through. 
Mark will touch on the growth projects in a moment, but all on time and on budget, and they obviously contribute through, I've said, towards the end of that '22 period. 
So just before I hand back to Mark, once again, fully committed to the balanced approach of running a strong balance sheet, flexibility through the cycle so that we can focus and create on long-term value for not only our shareholders but all of our stakeholders. We'll continue with attractive returns and balance as we think about those returns to shareholders, as we try to look after both today's cash flow and the generation of tomorrow's cash flows. So a disciplined, value-adding approach. 
Mark mentioned the long-term EBITDA margin target, so I won't go into that again. But we do believe that we've got some upside still to flow through that as we deliver those underlying improvements in the business so that we get an increased sustainable margin, both at spot prices and at long-term consensus pricing. 
Mark, back to you."

Last 10 games though, they've done a remarkable job. They've shot to second last in the premier league. So those other Watford supporters, Duncan, you can commiserate. 
Disciplined growth. So where to next? The first point I'd like to make in the conversation around  growth, it's not simply about top line growth. When we talk growth, it's about growing value. And so there, for us, it's growing top line revenues and it's about growing margins in particular. And so for us, growth is about growing cash flow and growing returns. And I obviously touched something there -- oops, there we go. 
So for us, it's about sustainable free cash flow and returns, and that's really the key part of our focus. Well, that's really where the focus is for us as a group. 
Okay. In terms of projects, Quellaveco, doing well, on time, on budget, very pleased with the progress we've seen. And again, I'd invite you to have a quick chat to Tom while he's here. Again, the complexities, and there are political complexities in all of the jurisdictions that the mining industry operates, but I think we've navigated those extremely well. And the local community relationships are exceptional. And for Peru, if you can get those relationships right, it's a key to being successful in the country. And so I think the team has done a good job, and we're very pleased with the progress so far. 
In terms of De Beers, with the new boat going -- is it a ship or a boat, Bruce? It's a ship. Stuart is going to kick me for even asking the question. Very happy with the progress, and the team has done a great job in working with the manufacturers, and I think they're doing very well in time. Just to remind you, the quality of the diamonds from the marine projects is very high. It's around $500 a carat. And so it really does add quality and margin again to De Beers' work, and a very important one for us. 
Aquila met coal going very well, decline, a pretty straightforward operation, but an important one that picks up where Grasstree will finish off with its life. So very pleased with progress right across the board. And certainly, [ a 2-path ] growth engine seems to be going very well, and we've got a number of things still to come through Moranbah-Grosvenor that Stephen's talked about. 
In terms of Sirius, I will stick closer to my script. It is a quality asset. We've talked about the polyhalite resource being a very different type of product, multinutrient, low chloride, low cost. It's a product that will travel. And certainly the feedback we've had when we've done our due diligence work has been very positive. And in particular, the form that the product comes in is very important in terms of the value proposition. So we think it has good potential. Obviously, there's still a lot more work to do. And taking all those factors into account, we think the offer that we have is fair and reasonable, and it's taken all of those issues into proper account. 
The only other point I would make is we still have a way to go. There still is a vote from shareholders required, and all we ask is that shareholders take note of the Chairman's statement in the documentation regarding their recommendation in terms of the Anglo offer. And so from our perspective, it's a work [ that's ] in progress, still a long way to go. And again, we encourage those shareholders to look at the statement from the Chairman and the directors in terms of the Anglo proposition that is currently sitting before them. 
In terms of the future and how we think about the business, it is very much about quality assets. And again, our conversation around Sirius fits into that conversation, as we do see there's a potential Tier 1 asset. And for us, we think that our focus in terms of what we've been doing with the portfolio, with the portfolio on a broader basis is consistent with those themes. We are continuing to shape the portfolio on the basis of a quality asset in markets that we think have potential strong pricing fundamentals and, from our perspective, something that we understand and we believe we can do well in. 
Our business model and the way we invest across the value chain is fundamentally different to our competitors'. Our business model is a very different business model to a trading model or a logistics model. It is about understanding what we do from mine through to customer and consumer, and making sure that we're investing in leverage points across the value chain. And that is a different approach. That approach has been absolutely clear as a bell, obviously in De Beers. But our investment in platinum and the profile we've taken in the PGM industry is unique as well, and the work on venture capital in helping promote uses of platinum and other materials in terms of the hydrogen economy is how we differentiate ourselves in the way we think about our business and the models we're creating. 
In terms of FutureSmart mining, when we talk about carbon neutrality or we talk about the way the mining industry needs to look in 5, 10, 20 years, we've been in a strategic conversation for 6 years. FutureSmart mining is about changing the way mining is carried out so that we can ultimately get to carbon neutrality, that we can ultimately reduce our footprint and connect ourselves to local community in a very different way compared to what we've done as an industry in the past. Our regional collaborative development model is unique. GemFair, working with our traditional miners and government to change the nature of mining is strategic, it's different. And we understand in some cases, people struggle with some of the things we're doing. But as each day goes by, what we're doing makes more sense to those that talk ESG. It's not about talking, it's about walking. And we're proud to say that in the last 3 or 4 weeks with the publishing of the Responsibility Index, which is walk versus talk, we've come up as the top resources company. Now the challenge is to continue walking and leading the industry and the changes that we've talked to. And those conversations will lead us -- and those approaches will lead us in terms of how we profile the business in terms of Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 positions. But anything we talk to, any target we set will be based on the way we believe we should be transforming the business. It will have substance behind it. That's an important point. And for us, FutureSmart is the substance behind the conversation, and we've been there for 6 years. 
And putting all those pieces together, it's about people. We've built and developed, we think, an exceptional team across the business. We continue to evolve the business. And from our perspective, it's about people and about making sure we've got the right people in the right roles. And so we believe that, that will always be a works in progress, but it is again a defining position for us in the industry. 
On asset portfolio, again Stephen, I think, said it well, a clip on diamonds and in PGMs, we are industry leaders. We take that leadership role seriously in terms of the way we talk to our industry, the way we talk to our products, the way we interface with both customers and consumers, and we understand the difference between the 2 and how we're developing our business for the longer term. Clearly, Bruce and his team are doing a lot of work in rethinking and reimagining the way diamond should be taken forward, and we're looking at every part of the value chain in terms of how it can make a more significant contribution in driving long-term value. Very important piece for us. And Chris has done the same in the PGM industry. 
Our high-quality bulks are unique in terms of quality. And for us, we've been positioning in that business the way we have for some years. We've taken Kumba's product from about 62%, 63% to 64.5% on the basis that we believe the market will reward quality, consistency and the relationship that we create in our markets and put that with our marketing work, again, a unique positioning in the industry. 
And with copper, nickel and other products we produce, again a -- very much a future-facing portfolio, which we think is very much a differentiating factor in terms of the future and ultimately, we think future returns. 
Our investment proposition, again, is based on competitive assets, and you've seen our improvement in competitive position. We have built a differentiated set of capabilities. We've been thinking strategically from day 1 in terms of our transformation. How do we create a company that leads the industry in the way it thinks about how it services society and delivers the products the right way and in a way that are valued by society in terms of what we bring to the conversation? And those footprints and the work we're doing is consistent with that differentiated set of capabilities. A lot of people now are talking about focus on technical, focusing on operating capacities, we've been there for 6 years. 
And then finally, in terms of returns. When Stephen talks about balance, it is about discipline in capital allocation, investing in the right things and making sure the business is sustainable in every sense of the word. So whether it's a safety conversation or whether it's a growth conversation or whether it's a competitive cost position, it's all about building a sustainable business. And by that, we mean delivering sustainable returns and improving returns to our shareholders. 
So with that, Stephen and I would be thrilled to take your questions."

Just 2 questions, if I may. 
Firstly, just on capital allocation. Stephen, you obviously gave us a nice sort of pie chart, and that is on a consolidated basis. But if you look at the ex South African net debt, that went up from about 8.5  -- I think another $400 million, $500 million up. So you were essentially buying back from debt. Could you give us an idea of the split just between how much you bought back in South Africa and in -- outside of South Africa? And obviously, you've said in the past, that does matter. I mean, with CapEx now rising, do you think it's -- there's room for more buybacks down the line? I mean, obviously, cash flow generation is very strong. A lot of that is in South Africa. So maybe just how you think about that? 
And then secondly, just on diamonds. You've obviously kept your guidance at 32 to 34. So that's roughly, let's say, 2 million to 3 million carats additional supply this year versus last year. You also have, let's say, $400 million or $500 million of inventory that you're looking to sell down this year. Do you think, given the environment with the coronavirus and Alrosa are looking to destock by 4 million, 5 million carats, it's appropriate to still maintain that? Or was it more you'll see how things go and adjust when appropriate?"

So remembering a couple of things. So we pay 100% of the group dividend from South African cash. And also, we got permission to pay the full buyback from South African cash. So -- and the way we implemented that buyback was consistent with a proportional representation of the register. So it was a proportional buyback in South Africa as well as it was out of London. So I suppose we kept that fairly constant. 
Remembering also that we have the majority of those South African dollars held in U.S. dollars in London. And so at year-end, we actually had very limited local currency in South Africa. You'll see that when you see the detail in the notes. So I'd have to say we're fairly comfortable. And practically, it doesn't have a big impact in terms of how we manage the cash."

I would argue that the Anglo American global story is just as exciting, but we've probably got a much broader pool that we're playing in. And over time, we've experienced those things tend to normalize out. So I think it's the normal ebb and flow we see in terms of differences. 
Our job at Anglo is to keep growing the business in terms of margins and cash flow. And where we were trading maybe at a 40% discount a year or 2 ago, we're at about 19% discount. If we keep closing that gap and deliver a 30-odd percent return to shareholders, at some point people start switching their money on a broader basis. And our appeal to generalists, we think, is something that could quite materially change how people look at us. So we're focused on the big guide, the longer-term guide and the fact that we've got assets making a great contribution, it's a bigger story. Copper, the whole story is, in our view, the main gun, okay? 
Quellaveco. Look, the guys are doing a good job. On paper, we're doing extremely well. But I've been around this industry for 43 years. I've run major projects. You can lose the gains very quickly. And so from our point of view, we'd like to see a little bit more time and finish off -- we'd like to see the concrete finished in the mill, in particular, because we've still got, what, 60-odd thousand tonnes of concrete to place in the mill [ tun ]. So before I start flapping my gums and looking too excited, I'd like to see that done. So -- but we're making good progress. There is no doubt on the technical aspects, we're doing extremely well.

Because don't forget, palladium is very important in terms of [ being the ] heat source in the car, whereas platinum is more effective further down the process. 
So there are some technical questions. The real question is, how long will the technical people take and what can they do to maybe shift the use of platinum, palladium and rhodium around? Rhodium is used for a whole range of things. So the world is short rhodium clearly at the moment. And I'm not sure there's a lot more coming on in the near term. So it's in a pretty good position. Platinum, I still think will be a beneficiary, but it might take a little bit longer. 
In terms of Mogalakwena, to get it into 2 parts, you've got 1/3 are a new concentrator, which would be certainly in the 1 billion to 1.5 billion type range, but you've also then got the technical type solutions where it might be ore sorting and a whole range of incremental capital options that give you a far better return. 
So we've got a fair range of things that we're looking at. And from our perspective, I wouldn't like to call it here or there because this technical stuff is really coming along extremely well. We've got our first bulk sorter in El Soldado operating, doing very well. We're building at Mogalakwena as we speak. We're in..."

We're still doing the studies in terms of that Mogalakwena options, and it would really be -- towards the end of '21 that we'd be looking to bring that forward or maybe a little bit earlier through '21, that we'd complete those studies and perhaps link up with the work Tony is doing to be able to make some decisions. 
Again, just about capital discipline. We're not going to rush out, as Mark said, just because we have a high price today. We want to make the right long-term decisions in how we spend that capital. 
On the overall CapEx question, a couple of points to make. Obviously, as we deliver Quellaveco, Moranbah-Grosvenor brownfield, the new ship in Namibia, we'll be generating additional cash flows from all of those businesses as well as additional cash flows from the underlying business, given the improvements that we're focused on. So the business will be, I think, in quite a different place in the next couple of years. 
Could we have a sequence then of other capital projects without preempting any decision? Potentially so. But obviously, each of those decisions will be made in their own right based on meeting metrics, based on a view of markets, not just for the now, but for the longer term. So how that plays out, we'll have to wait and see how markets develop. But potentially, we could have some internal options in front of us. 
I think a nice position to be in, to at least have the options there. We'll make the decision about capital when it's the right time to make the decision on capital."

We'd use excess solar capacity to generate hydrogen, and we'll be installing a hydrogen -- and it's a hybrid hydrogen battery truck by the end of the year. Tony, I think that's the plan in terms of the work you're doing with NG, it's the partnership with NG. That would be a precursor to a broader commitment on hydrogen options for our off-truck -- off-highway truck fleet. That's part of our whole carbon gas or decarbonization strategy. 
We're also looking at something in the Northern Cape. We've had discussions with the various ministers in South Africa, very supportive of those types of options. Their main point is that they are not keen to see people selling back into grid. So you do a self-contained system, which works perfectly for what we want to do because we would use excess capacity to generate hydrogen so that we continue to decarbonize on a much broader footprint. So that's absolutely critical. And that logic holds for any jurisdiction we're in. So I think that's part of this pathway 2 in terms of improvement.

Obviously, I've already talked about diamonds. Beyond that, no major changes, and we think things are starting to move forward. 
Minas-Rio. What we do is we do an annual pig run, where we're making sure that the pipeline is in good shape. And so from our point of view, that's a normal part of the process, and that's already contained within the full year forecast. 
Fortuitously, that helps us in iron ore because we'll do that in April. So if there's going to be an impact in iron ore, the fact that we've got to plan off of that period actually gives us a little bit of wiggle room in terms of any impacts that we may see. But it's primarily iron ore. And so there are probably a few others that would be a bit more sensitive to that than us."

We also had a little bit of inventory build or not as much inventory runoff as we would have liked in platinum. So again, I'd love to see some of that run down. 
It's a different mix between the 2. In De Beers, it's really held as finished goods ready to go. In platinum, it's held as, largely as work-in-progress. So getting it through the last phases of the processing plant is really important in that part of the business. And so I'd love to see that perhaps come back towards normal levels again. 
On Los Bronces, I'm not sure I can add too much more to the guidance that we've given. We've given a production range, as Ruben said, of that 620 to 670. That's really around water.

I'm here slaving away at work. Stephen sitting in his backyard next to the pool. So if we look at each other and we're juggling between the 2 of us, it's just making sure that we're coordinated. Hopefully, you're all used to the format by now. We're still developing and making sure we get it right. But the most important thing is that we connected with you, give you a chance to ask questions as well. And from our point of view, make sure that we're accessible to our shareholders. We are open for business. 
So I'm on the first slide, which is the header. From our point of view, it's obviously been a very tough 6 months. COVID-19 is a new term we've all had to learn and adapt to. In our case, it obviously had -- it has obviously had a material impact on our operations in the business. But certainly, from our perspective, I think we finished the half strong. And we also believe that taking that improving performance into the second half will be the key to us delivering a much better full year result. 
In opening the presentation, I think it's also important to acknowledge all of our colleagues in Anglo America, acknowledge the communities with which we work, in which we operate and with which we work and the partnership we've had with so many members in the community and so many stakeholders across the board. Our We Care program has become a cornerstone for our response to COVID, in which we focus on making sure that our people are looked after, that we're also playing our part in our local communities, even more so than we normally do, and I'll talk a little bit about that later. And from our point of view that we're making a real contribution. At the same time, we've been working very hard to make sure that we protect the business, that we maintain business continuity, and we're rebuilding the operations after some pretty significant lockdowns in March and April. 
I guess the best way to show that or characterize that in numbers is, in April after the March lockdowns, we were producing at less than 60% of production capacity. And by the end of June, we're at 90%. So the recovery continues. There's still got some -- we've still got some hard work to do. And I do expect that the second half may be a little bumpy, but certainly, we're in a very different place. And I think we've built a set of relationships with communities and governments where they know and understand how we can help keep the economy going and at the same time, keep people safe. And I think that's the key to the future. And certainly, from our perspective, I think we've built that foundation and that trust with our communities and with our governments that does support us in going forward. 
So let's jump straight into the presentation. I'm going to go to Slide 3, which is the agenda, very simply put. We'll keep the order of play as usual. I'll talk about where we are today. With the world a more complex place, and I think it's important for you to know how we're dealing with the issues. Stephen will take you through the numbers and pull apart the detail. And then I will pick the ball back up and take you through how we see the forward look, and then we'll go to Q&A. 
So I'm now on Slide 4. As we should and always do, we open with safety, health and environment. At first glance, if you look at where we've come from over the last 7 years, we've been significantly improving our performance in the business. In safety, about a 70% improvement in terms of our injury frequency rates, but even more important, our fatalities have dropped 93.5%. In the last 12 months, we've lost one colleague. That's one too many, but we're making progress from where we started. Secondly, in terms of health, we've improved our position 95% in eliminating serious health hazards through the business. 
And on environment, we've reduced our incidents by 97%. But when you talk about those issues, it's not simply about numbers. We've had some serious incidents in the first half, and we've just been bloody lucky we didn't lose a colleague in those incidents. And so we've improved the underlying performance, we still haven't delivered 0 incidents, and that's something that we're focused on, and we'll continue to improve. 
As you're aware, on the Moranbah longwall face, we had a ground fall. We since recovered. We understand the issue, where we've not had the right technical design inputting into changing geotechnical conditions. We've actually changed the organization design to make sure that we've got that response. We've also checked across the business in any other areas where we may be deficient in terms of the level of technical input, and I think we've straightened that issue out. I guess the proof is in the pudding. We ended up getting the wall away about 3 weeks earlier than our forecast after the fall, and the operation has been going well since. And certainly, the digitization work that Tony and the team have been doing with Seamus, has helped improve our performance, and we have to keep improving. In terms of the converter incident in platinum, Natasha and the team have already implemented a range of both physical and operating process controls, 8, in fact. And again, we'll continue on our pathway to automation and the high installation of hard controls in those processes where we have elevated R. I guess, in both cases, the important thing to observe as well is that our secondary safety controls, that is the flags and making sure people were clear of those areas where there was a heightened risk, ensured that we didn't have any injuries through either of those incidents. And that's a very important issue for us and a good learning as well. 
In terms of Grosvenor, the ignition of gas on the longwall face, it would appear the gas was flushed through a waste fall. In looking at the other elements and learnings, we're still very much in an investigation process as is the department. But most importantly, our 5 colleagues that were injured are now making a good recovery some are already home. But again, we're making sure that we're working with the families and helping them on the rehabilitation path. I guess, most importantly, and again, the key point to stress for us as a business is that we have to continue to improve and get to 0. 
On health, our We Care program was our central focus in 2020, obviously, with COVID. I will talk to that a little bit. And on the environment, we've had 1 incident, which was a repeat spill due to heavy rains in South Africa in 1 of the tailings areas in the base metals refinery. And again, introducing some additional engineering work to make sure that we don't have that exposure on a go-forward basis. 
So for us, the other 2 milestones that were important for us in 2020 on the environmental side was the confirmation that we believe we can get to carbon neutrality by 2040 and that we would have at least 8 operations carbon neutral by 2030. I think the thing that characterizes us differently is we are willing and will show you when we meet a pathway to carbon neutrality that's quite unique and different in the industry, and our 2040 data is certainly leading edge in terms of industry and making sure we get there in good time. That obviously -- and that move obviously coincides with our announcement on the demerger or our intention of a potential demerger of thermal coal operations in South Africa in the 2 to 3-year time frame. All very important milestones for us and our business and very much a statement about where the portfolio is going over the next few years. 
In going to the next slide, which is Slide 5 in your deck. Again, the numbers show how challenging and volatile times have been and we didn't help ourselves with those self-inflicted interruptions, but we've still maintained our focus on improving the business and making sure that we're putting our best foot forward to wherever we can. 
While production was down 11%, I think it's more -- it's very important to understand that at the same time, and with the big lockdowns, we lost 20% of our working hours during the course of the first half. As I said, we were down -- or we lost almost 50% of our workforce at the end of -- towards the end of March and into April. And on a full half basis, we lost about 20% of the time available to us in terms of our production teams. So the 11% production drop is credible in that context. 
Our operating costs, 4% lower than we were last year has obviously had some help from foreign exchange. But again, at the operating level, we were still down 3% or 4% against where we were last year on an apples-for-apples basis. And so I think the progress we've made in continuing to improve our productivity has been very solid. And again, when I adjust for hours work, our productivities were actually up 7%. So the underlying performance was strong and obviously, big impact from lockdowns and the other measures we've had to take as a consequence of COVID. 
Stephen will take you through the balance sheet details a little further. So I won't dwell any longer on the actual operating numbers other than to make 1 point. We've delivered a dividend, consistent with our policy, the 40% payout ratio, and that's important. And so from our perspective, we've maintained faith with our shareholders as we said we would. 
In terms of defining and describing our response to COVID, we talk about the response in 3 parts. Firstly, and through our We Care program, we focused on prevention, that is keeping people safe and hoping that we can keep them away from exposure in terms of the virus. And that includes our work in the community. Secondly, in having an exposure, how do we respond? How do we sort the business and make sure we can figure the business to continue operations. And then obviously, while we're doing all of that work, doing all of that work with the communities and doing all of that work with governments, we've also got 1 eye trained very firmly on how we recover the business over time. And as I said, getting to 90% production by the end of June was very important to us. And I'm still sure that it will be a bit of a bumpy ride through the second half. But the most important thing is we've established a relationship with our communities. We've established trust. We've established a relationship with governments. We're providing advice and support on how they can do with issues. We've actually design new ways of operating, social distancing. We have our own app engage, which every 1 of our employees has that helps them understand our expectations and also provides a platform to communicate how we can improve things. And so the tailoring of the business has been something quite -- and from our perspective, there will be many positives that come out of the learnings we've been through in terms of the business. And so the final point I'd make in terms of our response and how we've connected with our communities, this is not new to us. It's in our DNA. It's consistent with our purpose, which is around reimagine mining to improve people's lives. And again, the learnings that we've had are significant and we'll certainly improve both our approach in connection with our communities. And on a longer-term basis in terms of the way we see efficiencies and how we can work differently and more efficiently across the business. 
I'm now on Slide 7. Just to reinforce how far we've come in the last few years in 2012 and with materially higher commodity prices, our industrial margin was sitting around 30%. In 2019, it was almost 10% lower prices. We actually delivered margins of 42%. If I adjust adjust for commodity price/mix, we would have been at around 47%, if we were back in 2012. So the improvements have been significant, and they've been sustained in the business. Our operating costs are 30% lower. That's in nominal terms, and our productivities are double where they were back in 2012. 
For us, the first half was also impacted by the delay in sales, obviously, not much going on in the diamond sector or the luxury goods sector. In PGMs, obviously, the converter incident had an impact on what we get out, but we'll see both of those improve in the second half. And so we expect our sales to start picking up and certainly, the cash flow position to change to the upside as we continue to improve our sales and pull stocks out of working capital. 
More specifically and talking about Diamond, the diamond market and why we believe it's structurally attractive, as you know, the diamond market has been growing in the last 10 years and 2009 was the last recession or the last major recession. And we've seen consistent sales growth over that period. 
It's also important to note that we've seen consistent supply growth through that period. And that's something that's changing across the industry. Today, we've seen continuing improvement -- or we've seen a very tough start to the year, but we've seen continuing efficiency improvements in the business. But with the market where it is, we've actually pulled back our production more than 20%. And we've seen the other major player in the market pull its production back as well. And we also expect supply to fall away as smaller operators of much more difficult to operate in these times. And with companies closing operation through resource depletion, because you can't forget we haven't seen a major new discovery in diamonds for the last 10 years, we think structurally, the prognosis is very good. Our research tells us that the market is strong. And in our case, when you look at China, which was first impacted by COVID, we saw virtually no sales in the first quarter. Yet in March and June of this year, we've seen sales actually exceed last year's May and June figures. And the sense we have from interacting with people on the ground is very positive. 
Now we certainly don't expect Europe and the U.S. to recover as quickly. For us, a key selling part of the year is in the period from Thanksgiving through to the new -- or through to Christmas and the new Year in the U.S., we would expect to see things pick up materially by then. But again, we're not ones to try and forecast in a month. Our stock position will be such that we can respond quickly to a change in the market. And certainly, we'd expect to start to see stocks running down in the fourth quarter. 
But again, I'll let Stephen talk to that in terms of where we are. But given that we've pulled production back, and we see a continuing depletion in the midstream because there are sales actually occurring, we think the business will be in a good position by year-end and certainly be ready for a much stronger 2021. Finally, again, with supplies falling away somewhere between 15% and 20% over the next 2 or 3 years, we expect our rare product to become much rarer. And so for us, structurally, we think diamonds is in a good place. 
On a broader scale and across the business, and I'm now on Slide 9. Our copper business has done extremely well in the first half. Great performances from [indiscernible], Los Bronces is actually starting to get some mind. So that's good news. Our costs have dropped from $1.35 to $1.07 a a pound. And yes, foreign exchanges has played a part, but our operating costs have been really improving at the operating level on an apples-for-apples basis. And so thrilled with what's happening. And remember, with Quellaveco  and other incremental improvements, we expect to grow our business 50% with Quellaveco  making a Q1 cost contribution to the operations. You're going to see us grow the business and reduce our operating costs, really thrilled with the work the guys have done. 
 In PGMs, again, we've positioned strongly for the recovery. We've got the second or the standby converter operating. We will have the refurbished converter operating in Q4. And so again, that will continue the recovery. And again, with Mogalakwena almost at full rate, Amandelbult at about 70% and Natasha you're focusing very strongly on the stability and the performance of the processing operations, I think we're in good shape. 
We are still seeing infections around the communities in and around our platinum operations. But with recovery of people that had been infected actually outnumbering new infections, we're actually seeing a drift positive drift back into the operations of people. So again, we think we're dealing, managing the issues well, and we're seeing people return to work. 
Across Bulks, again, another solid response, particularly pleasing with the Minas-Rio ramp up. Through the half, I think we were about 21% of where we were last year. We actually touched nominal capacity in March. So great performance at Minas-Rio. The nickel operations also in Brazil have done exceptionally well. Seamus and the guys obviously had the Grosvenor incident in Australia, but now Moranbah and the other operations are doing well. Kumba, great recovery after the lock down in March. Timber and the team have done a great job and you will see in those results as they reported yesterday. 
I'd also like to make a special comment and commend our Bulks team or, in particular, the marketing team in Bulks and across the board. They've done a great job in getting our product to market. And in particular, when we had the issue with the converter, we were able to satisfy all of our customer needs in the PGM space. And I think that was a remarkable piece of work. And there's also why people probably haven't got our earnings forecast absolutely right because the marketing team have made a great contribution. 
So for the second half, we believe the operations are heading into more stable and capable territory. And certainly, we think the second half should be a much better half for us. 
And with that, I'll hand across to Stephen. Stephen, you can see you're on."

As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on how we expect the balance sheet to respond from here. While I'm on the balance sheet, really pleased to see the lifting of the South African exchange control restrictions that was also announced back in February. We've managed costs tightly through the period, but sustainably, it's helped underpin our earnings. We've been able to exercise a degree of flexibility in CapEx to help protect our cash flows where needed. But importantly, we've done all of this in a really sustainable way. Fully funding our staying business capital and not compromising our growth projects. 
So looking at the numbers, it was always going to be a volatile period, but they reflect all of the hard work across the whole Anglo American team. An EBITDA of $3.4 billion, despite an 11% impact on production. And that's really benefited from the transformation process that we've been through for the last 7 years. It's really given us a solid operational base. EPS at $0.72 a share. And off the back of that, a $0.28 dividend based on our 40% payout policy. Unit costs, down 4%, with some help from FX. But remember, that is off a lower production volume. So some really good performance at an important time for us. CapEx $1.8 billion and I'll talk to cash flow and working capital a little bit later. 
So moving to Slide 12. Looking at the breakdown of the $3.4 billion across the business unit. As you would expect, very limited earnings from diamonds, given the extent of the lockdown right across the whole diamond value chain. And just to remind you, we did give flexibility to our customers, particularly through Q2. Really good performance from copper, as Mark touched on, in an environment where we had slightly softer prices, some challenges at Los Bronces with water. But production back on track and traveling very strongly with C1 cash cost of [ $1.07 a pound ]. PGM is obviously heavily affected by the converter plant outage but strong earnings, when you consider this really closer to 1/4 sale rather than 2. And again, full complements to the marketing team who managed to juggle those production challenges, sourcing material in a tight market and meeting our customers' demand with all of the uncertainty that they were also going through. 
Bulks benefiting from the great work at Minas-Rio, good recovery at Kumba post the lockdowns and definitely helped by the stronger iron ore price in the bulks, partly offset by lower prices of met coal and the operational issues that Mark spoke to. 
So if we turn to Slide 13 and the drivers of EBITDA. Firstly, price, some ups and downs across met coal thermal coal, copper that I've spoken to, but broadly offset by the benefit that we see in the weaker producer currencies. The impact of COVID, approximately USD 1.1 billion, largely from consumer demand affecting diamonds and the South African lockdowns that we had through that March-April period at Kumba, PGMs and thermal coal. 
We took a considered and staged approach at each site. We felt it was appropriate, also considering the community country aspects, always with health and safety is our #1 priority. 
The outage ACP at PGMs reduced EBITDA by $0.6 billion and together with $0.4 billion in relation to the disruptions at met coal. So to all of those things aside, the rest of the business actually performed quite well, led by copper and Minas-Rio in particular. Hence, the $0.4 billion improvement, driven by those 2 sites. 
Turning to Slide 14. On the balance sheet. We -- as I said, we entered the start of the period, a very, very strong position. Net debt to EBITDA, 0.5x at the start of the period. And there was 2 primary factors across the 6 months that saw net debt increase. So firstly, the allocation of capital towards growth, $0.4 billion at Quellaveco and $0.7 billion with the acquisition of a [ crop ] nutrients business as we acquired Sirius. Secondly, we had a $1.4 billion buildup of working capital across the half. Diamonds at $0.5 billion and PGMs also at $0.5 billion. We had some shorter-term weather impacts just towards the end of June at copper in Kumba. So we do expect working capital should run down through the second half. So Diamond is probably more over a 6 to 12 month period, depending on markets. PGMs fairly substantially over the next 6 to 9 months. And the copper and Kumba miner bill should clear in Q3. Also, helpfully, from a balance sheet perspective, the lifting of South African exchange controls, and that's now in the process of being implemented and developed, a really pleasing development. As I've said previously, the currency controls that used to exist didn't have a major practical or a significant impact on us. But we do welcome the simplicity and capital structure and the move towards a more typical OECD regime. 
I think it also sends a really strong positive message about the country's desire to promote investment and growth. So as a result, net debt of $7.6 billion. That's around 1.1x EBITDA, well within our guided range. Now obviously, as we look forward, all subject to the normal caveats, particularly around prices, exchange rates and any impact from COVID, but we would generally expect that number to trend downwards from here towards year-end. 
Turning to CapEx on Slide 15. We're staying with our revised guidance, down by $1 billion to $4 billion, to $4.5 billion. And that does include the $300 million of year 1 spend at the Woodsmith project following the Sirius acquisition. 
The decrease in capital driven from a number of factors, weaker local exchange rates, some flexibility in the timing of our critical projects and obviously, staying focused on our staying business capital spend. That reduction does include $300 million reduction in Quellaveco, and Mark will touch on that a little bit later. But importantly, because of the strength of the balance sheet, we've been able to make every decision for every asset for the right health and safety reason and for the right long-term economic outcome. At the same time, our brownfield projects, the diamond vessel in Namibia and Aquila in met coal remain on track and on budget, and you would have seen our recent announcement of a life extension project at Kumba at the Kolomela mine side. 
So clearly, on Slide 16, we remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation. And so to the scorecard for the half, over the last 6 months, we maintained our base dividend, $600 million for the final dividend from 2019, and we allocated capital to some discretionary options. So growth capital in total, $0.8 billion for Sirius acquisition and $6 billion on our other growth projects, and we also saw the finalization of the additional shareholder return. So $200 million from the share buyback program. 
So stepping back on Slide 17, yes, a volatile few months, but we're well placed, and it still remains about balance. We reinstated the dividend in '17, and since then, we have returned $5 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our balance sheet target of no more than 1.5x net debt-to-EBITDA through the cycle. All of that underpins our growth profile. Our P101 technology development and the marketing focus on margins allows us to invest sensibly across the business. And that, in turn, will drive our growth in production, EBITDA and cash flow. Quellaveco project in Peru, the brownfields project, should deliver a combined 20% to 25% production growth by 2023. In copper equivalent terms, that's really market leading. We believe our long-term EBITDA margins from the mining business can reach that 45% level based on long-term consensus commodity prices. So a real commitment to get the balance right. 
In terms of balance sheet, returns to shareholders, importantly, relationships with stakeholders and the discretionary allocation of surplus cash flows. Mark, back to you."

Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things.

Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for a long time. And certainly, the work that we've done is starting to be recognized in terms of some of the new industries that are coming out. And our top rating in the FTSE in terms of what we're doing on the ground has been recognized. So from our point of view, all of those things matter. Consistent with that approach, and I'm on Slide 19, our work on the portfolio starts obviously around Quellaveco in Peru. Now prior to the onset of COVID-19 in mid-March, we were tracking somewhere between 3 and 4 months ahead of the program. The guys have been doing a fantastic job. When the national quarantine was imposed, the majority of the project's 10,000 strong workforce were demobilized in line with the government's request and asked to head home. So we've helped people get back to home. Construction work as a consequence was significantly slowed. And whilst we maintain some critical works on critical items, we were substantially stopped across the board. With quarantine extended, we then decided to extend the lockdown for 3 months to give a chance for the country to get on top of COVID and at the same time, so that we could minimize our outgoing cash expenditures with the view that we would then remobilize when we could put in place the workforce and deliver on full productivity. We thought that was the most effective way that we could contribute to the health and safety issues as well as make sure the project when we hit the button was able to run as hard as we could. 
So in taking that strategy, we're now on a restart, and it's a staged restart. We've estimated the cost of demobilization, remobilization and the cost of the structural changes we've made across the organization and how we've rescheduled to make sure we reduce the peak of workforce through the process. And in doing that, we've adjusted the financial estimate for the project to between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion. Now that leaves us with some contingency on the expectation but it still will be a bit of a bumpy ride over the next few months as we see secondary infections, those sorts of things. But we think we've catered to those properly. And at the same time, we still think it's quite reasonable and our forecast of delivering in 2022 remains on track. In fact, we're on track to the base schedule although we've had to give back, obviously, the big gains we made prior to March. But again, a lot of work going on to continue to improve that work. The last 3 months, we've also been focused on improving the way we bring the operation up through commissioning. And so we haven't completed that work, but we've got some positives there. So we believe we can offset any cost issues and pull back some of that improved value through the way we operate through commissioning. 
So I'm pretty pleased with the work the guys have done, and I think we're in really good shape. 
In terms of crop nutrients, the U.K., despite a really tough period in lockdown, we were able to get back to work relatively quickly, implemented our social distancing rules and where we've been somewhere like 30% or 40% above on productivity in the underground operation by changing and reconfiguring, we're not quite at that level above our plan, but we are on track to deliver the planned works for the year. That is the $300 million. So Chris and the guys have done a fantastic job. And as we look at the business and we look at the market potential, we're happier today than we were on the day we bought the asset on the basis of what we've seen. The guys have done a great job. Yes, there'll be some technical adjustments but they're at the margin. We think, generally, the team has got the configuration right. And from our point of view, the market and the interest we've had in the market for the product has really been positive, particularly when you think about the new world in terms of fertilizers and what we'll have to see in agriculture in terms of smart use of fertilizers. We think the products will be producing are certainly made-to-order for that new world. 
So very happy with where we are on Woodsmith. 
In terms of the transition from thermal coal, I think it's important to remember that as we transition out of thermal coal, we're building crop nutrients. And the crop nutrients business probably has got double the potential contribution it can make to the business. So we think that's a pretty good swap. In thermal coal, we've already reduced our footprint by 55% back in '15, '16 when we sold assets that we didn't think could make a material contribution in the longer term. We're well on the way. Today, it represents 5% of the EBITDA across the business and probably reducing over time, given the price forecast, we expect to be out of the business within 2 to 3 years. And from our point of view, that's a good place to be. But at the same time, we've got to acknowledge that they are and remain low-cost competitive assets, albeit with a relatively shorter mine life than the balance of our assets across the portfolio, but a good pack of assets, likely a demerger within the next couple of years. We think that's the right decision for Anglo American. 
In terms of our broader portfolio and its positioning in the world that we're looking at in terms of the future, we're certainly positioned to contribute to an environmental led new materials demand. We've seen the early evolution of electric vehicles and some of the challenges of energy storage. Now we're seeing widespread investment plans in hydrogen, first in China and demand in the automotive sector. We're seeing, obviously, buses in Britain using hydrogen. And now in Europe, we're seeing a much broader application and pull for hydrogen products. We've been central to the promotion of hydrogen as the new fuel source. We're a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. And certainly from our point of view, and our involvement in PGMs, gives us a vested interest in making sure that we help support growth in the industry. 
For us, you'll be aware that we're looking at introducing a solar array in South Africa to generate or use renewables to generate primary energy, but we'll oversize those units and generate hydrogen so we can start converting the major truck fleets to hydrogen consumption as well. 
So from our perspective, it's a great place to be. And most importantly, over the same period, and with a greater use of renewables, we also improve our cost structures by reducing energy consumption by 30% and by 2030, which is also part of -- and 1 of the most important drivers of our cost reduction strategy as well. So 1 plus 1 gets 3 in terms of what we think hydrogen and other new developments will contribute in terms of our world. 
On Slide 23, you'll see our conversation around having an active route to a greener world and from our point of view, that's where we're going as a business. This approach fits with our commitment towards the environment and minimizing our direct impact and footprint in terms of the communities around us. We've committed to making the business carbon neutral by 2040 earlier than most, and that by 2030, we'll have at least 8 operations that will be carbon neutral. Again, it will be a combination of solar, wind and other renewable sources connected to hydrogen and also battery power so that we create closed-loop systems, and the pathway is very clear. The detailed design is still in the works, but we're also starting to move on the pilots that we're looking at developing to demonstrate those pathways and the platinum business will be 1 of the first places that we develop. And in fact, we'll have our first off-highway truck on hydrogen during the course of this year. 
Our new technology and innovation work is also central to this footprint. That 30% energy reduction includes implementation of bulk sorting, coarse particle flotation, box orders. We've got in 3 operations already through copper, PGMs and nickel. We've also got coarse particle flotation units being built in the copper business in Chile as we speak. And again, as we go further down line, looking at reducing our water consumption by 50%. And and so really changing the nature of the operations, the footprint for the operations, and we hope creating a model for the industry that will drive us all towards a much greener future and a much more significant contribution to a green future for the planet. 
On Slide 24, we talk to the numbers in a very simple way. We're building and evolving a high-quality mix of assets that are suited to future demand and we expect to see improving margins as a consequence of those switch. So a consumer world, an electrified world, a greener world. And from our point of view, our cleaner, greener world products will make up 65% of our portfolio over the next few years. And certainly, from our point of view, even with our contribution in Bulks, we'll have high quality, highly efficient iron ore and met coal, which will make, again, another efficiency and cleaner contribution to the making of steel over the longer term. 
On Page 25, we talk to delivery, like all journeys to a much better place, the road is always not a smooth, or is not as always smooth as you'd like, but there is no doubt in our progress and our continuing commitment to outpace our competitors in growth and continuing business improvement. As we have along the journey, we will keep learning and getting better. And we continue to measure success in sustainability through 3 primary lenders: first, effectiveness. Over the long term, we believe those companies that can generate better than 10% free cash flow, will provide the ability to pay dividends and grow their business. And I'm not talking about the next 2 or 3 years, we're talking about the next 10 to 20 years. That's the business we're building. And as we broaden the contribution across our portfolio, you've got a portfolio set for long-term performance. Measuring the efficiency in how we generate those cash returns is just as critical for shareholders. And so our return on capital employed targets make sure that we keep our eye on capital discipline and that we don't throw money at simply generating cash and at the same time, destroying value. 
And being sustainable is absolutely key. So we have our 7 -- we have our 7 performance pillars: safety, environment, social performance, talent tool, making sure we've got the right people, production and resource base, and the life of assets we have in the portfolio, unit cost position, we continue to improve against our competitors, and ultimately, it's about having a conservative balance sheet that allows us to do the right things and continue to make sensible investments for the long term. 
And so with that, as a differentiated company in terms of assets, capabilities and the ability to deliver long-term returns, that's Anglo American, very happy to take questions."

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work. So when you get those numbers, they balance out pretty well. On the carbon neutrality approach, I think, firstly, a comment on pathways. You'll see in Brazil, where we've signed long-term contracts with renewable energy suppliers, doing similar work in Chile. We've got lots of sun in Chile. We've got lots of sun in South Africa and in Queensland. So we want to use solar energy as much as we can. The idea of then oversizing, converting to hydrogen, creating closed loops with battery technologies as well, is pretty well-being thought through. And you've got to remember, we're also looking at dropping our energy consumption through the efficiency work that we're doing at a technical level. So I think there's no doubt that we've got a complete solution pretty well thought through, and I think that's what puts us ahead, Liam. 
In terms of the 2040 target, again, we think we're on a good track to get there. We haven't relied on offsets to actually get to those numbers because of all of the work we're doing on the front end. I mean, we've been putting the right people on the ground, working all of these solutions out to come up with the position we've taken. Certainly, that leaves us with the ability to look at offsets, if needed, but we really want to drive the business to make a better contribution. In my view, offsets are sort of treating creating a little bit in that you're using someone else's credits to cover your own ability or inability to get to 0. So the focus for Anglo American is to get there under our own steam, if you pardon the pun. But at the same time, if we need to do a little bit on the offset side, we'll obviously keep that option open. 
And don't forget with crop nutrients, the idea of improving agricultural production means the world is going to have to use less land for agriculture to actually hit its carbon neutral targets. And so from our point of view, crop nutrients is a significant contributor to what difference we can make and given we've got such a small carbon footprint. 
So we've thought it through pretty well to get to those numbers."

So there was a bit of a view coming from investors that Anglo was getting quite competent and quite confident operationally. And I think some people leaving used the word swagger.

And today, I have the same investors ask me has something gone wrong in Anglo? So I'm just wondering, can you give us some color on the operational shortcomings that contributed to these incidents? And specifically, I'm interested to know how you might be adjusting your operating model or at least the implementation of the operating model to address these incidents?"

In our view -- we're about 50% of the way through the implementation of the detail in the operating model. Where we start is what we call work management, which is about how we get work done, how we plan work and making sure we're delivering as per plan. And that's been the driver between safety improvement, the 90-odd percent, the environmental improvement, the [ 90% ], the health improvement, 90% and that work has gone well. We call that work management. In terms of operating strategy and the detailed technical design work, there's been a lot of good work there, but we're probably still only 50% of the way up to where we want to be. And that includes the change in the control systems we've got, for example, in platinum. We've still got a lot of stuff that's done manually. So there's a lot more automation required. 
And for example, Natasha has introduced 8 new both physical controls and procedural controls in the converter to make sure we don't have the same incident. So we're still working through. We're still learning. We're still a work in progress in many ways. To be specific, at Moranbah on the longwall, the area that we started the wall had a little bit different geology, but we applied a standard design. What we've done now is as I said, look, any of those designs, and this goes right across the board or any of the major cutback designs, actually have to be signed off 1 level above because where you've got a change in circumstance, you really do make sure you've got all the issues covered. So I think that's an important change. And the new design configuration worked extremely well. We got away 3 works earlier and the operation has been going well. 
Now we've been implementing digitalization technologies in the management of the longwall, and that's improved our productivity and more than doubled, but there's still more work to be done. The Grosvenor issue in coal, a bit of a different issue. And I know a lot of technical people won't understand the issue. We don't think it was an operating issue in terms of the way we would handle things on a day-to-day basis. What appears as though we've had a major fall in the waste area, which all operations have, where you do have some accumulation of gas, where everybody has it, and it's actually flushed that gas onto the longwall [ face ]. The question is what may have ignited the gas? And that's where the investigation, what now is going on. And we'll find that solution. And I think, ultimately, that will require changes across the industry in the way some of these technologies work. But again, I'm going to let the investigation finish its work. But I think there'll be some changes in the industry. 
In terms of the ACP, again, there were some proceeds or issues and there were some control issues. I think Natasha is right on that. And to those that I've been talking to in the last few months, my -- I've explained the selection of Natasha in terms of her background in making sure we improve the operation stability and consistency out of platinum. And even though we've had massive change in the portfolio, our consistency hasn't been as good as it could be, and that's where the focus is. So I'd like to say that the 90% improvement that we've seen across all the dimensions indicates that we've gone somewhere very different to where we are but we've still got a way to go. We're still not as good as we would like to be, and we're still not at 0 incident. 
So we'll learn, we'll apply the lessons, and we'll keep getting better as we should."

Mark, I'll deal with the first one, and I'll make some opening comments on the second and then maybe throw to you. So in terms of working capital, if you look at the sort of 3 primary areas, diamonds -- as Mark said, will clearly be market dependent. And it's hard to pick a month, but we're confident the market will come back and demand will flow through quite strongly when it does come back. So without picking the month, whether it happens in November, December or January, February, I'm not too bothered by. It's really about market coming back, and I know the team are looking at how they can sell diamonds in a different way given the circumstances. So they're working hard on that one. On PGMs, given that we're now back up and running at the ACP and the materials flowing out, I'd expect that to come back quite strongly over the next 6 to 9 months. And so you should see it may not be all of it, but a substantial portion of that $0.5 billion reverse between now and probably the end of Q1 in 2021. 
And copper and Kumba really was just about swells or capacity at the port encumbers case. So that should close itself out back through Q3. So all things being equal, I'd love to think potentially, you're at least $0.5 billion, maybe a bit extra flushing out of that through the second half. But it is with all the qualifications that you would expect in terms of prices of markets and further interruptions by COVID. But that's probably about the best guidance I can give you is more around timing than absolute amounts. 
In terms of -- just maybe your first comment on our cost guidance, I mean, clearly, some of the businesses have been impacted by the disruptions, and some of that's flowing through into cost structure and met coal is probably a good example where that's flowing through quite directly into unit costs. And probably the currency hasn't helped in that case as the Aussie dollar strengthened against the U.S. 
In the other markets, yes, copper is probably the standout. Yes, we've seen quite a -- I don't know what the percentage would be, 20% movement in currencies through copper producing regions. That's clearly helped. And just looking across the others, again, there's no real comment there, given the limited sales through Brazil. 
Yes, again, we've had some currency movement that's helped. It's probably more in the sort of 10% to 15% range. So where we've produced well, you've seen sustainable cost out. And yes, that's been helped by foreign currency. There's no denying that. But you also have seen price movements. And so on Slide 13, I think you can see that those 2 things have largely offset 1 another between currency CPI and and price movements. And so there's a bit of and take across each of those. So rather than just focusing on cost, as I often do, I'd also ask you to focus on the price movement as well. 
Mark, any comments from here on that?"

I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio, and these are the same assets, I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the assets",458,"Yes. Look, again, another good question. I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio, and these are the same assets, I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the assets that we're operating, are on average doing 30% more in terms of production. And in terms of their actual performance, that group of assets is doing at least 20%. I think it's about 23%, 24% better on unit costs. So we're at another level of performance. And it's interesting our actual underlying performance is actually even better than that, but we're having a little less consistency because we're at a higher level of performance. Now people know there's a few of us in the business that are pretty forensic in the way we pull stuff apart and understand what's going wrong and what we need to do to get right. So we've obviously looked at the issues in coal and the ACP issue, but it's actually a much broader view. And we're looking at how we can improve the stability to take another 5% to 10% step on the operating cost side. And the 2 go hand-in-hand. 
So on the big improvements, we're continuing to make, we're giving about 60% back to inconsistency, and I'm talking about the last 12 months. So we're just working really hard with the teams to get the stability. And so on the basis of the first half, and Stephen and stripped away COVID and other movements, we had about a $400 million improvement outside of platinum and met coal. There's about a 4 -- 3% to 4% underlying cost improvement in the business if we can get that stability across the business that we'll take into the new year. So that's what Tony is focusing on with the operating teams is to get the stability. We're working at another level in terms of risks and automation. That work's ongoing with the digital work. So I'm hoping that we're taking 3% to 5% improvement that you're seeing some of it in the underlying performances into next year. But that's 1 we'll talk about at the end of the year once we've seen how far we've come along in terms of improving our stabilities. But the 1 thing I have to say, being in Anglo American is about constant improvement. And when we do have issues, we try and do everything we can to make sure we learn and we apply the lessons across the board. And we've stubbed our toe and we're in the process of making sure that we understand and apply those learnings. And again, we'll keep you posted on that progress over the next 6 months."

So I'll try and unpack it as quickly as I can endure with each of them. Firstly, on the thermal coal transfer, certainly from South Africa, the response from the government has been very positive and constructive. So if we ultimately go down the demerger proposal, and that's the most likely route, we'll certainly, I think, do that in better than 2 years. Ceragon, people know where we stand on Ceragon, we will exit at some point. But we are also being very respectful of our 2 partners in terms of our processes. We maintain a dialogue. And at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, I think we'll be gone from there as well. Again, I don't want to be or can't be too hard on the timing of that because, again, we've got 2 other -- 2 other -- I was going to say, customers, 2 other competitors and 2 other colleagues that we have in that asset, we're making sure that we deal with that the right way. But again, we should be out of both in that time frame. Certainly, the South African change will be much quicker. 
In terms of met coal, look, the carbon issue is obviously a question, but I think most investors are a little more sophisticated than people give them credit for. They understand that steel is absolutely critical. And that you need met coal in the mix, and it will take time to make the changes. But there's no doubt that in terms of capital allocation, we keep an eye on when those changes and how those trends will change. We do for iron ore as well. Because we will see more recycling by 2035. We think steel will make -- stell recycling will make up 50% of the mix. We think iron ore starts to change shape by 2025. So with both iron ore and met coal, we'll keep an eye on capital allocation. We'll tend to operate and run to pull a bit more cash. And our new investments will go into those commodities or products that we think are longer term, the big game changes, and that's why we think we're very different to our competitors we've got a much longer view. We've got a portfolio that's set up for the future. And certainly, we're making sure people are very clear that we're building this business for long-term performance. 
In terms of De Beers, being consistent on the different product side. In the last 10 years, De Beers have delivered around 10% sustainable free cash flow. So that's before it's growth CapEx. We're currently operating about 27 million, 28 million carats. We can actually take that up to about 37 million, 38 million carats, if the market is strong. We expect supply to drop away, 15% to 20% in the next 2 or 3 years. You know about argyle, and there are other changes in the market that are recurring. So structurally, we think the business is in good shape. We are when you look at it, running the best diamond business in the world, and it has been for 90 years, so there's no reason for us to think differently about that. We think prices will likely be stronger on the basis of supply falling away. There hasn't been a major discovery for 10 years. But in terms of what Bruce is doing, the rest of the business has made significant improvement in our cost structures.  De Beers has made improvements, but it hasn't come as far down that cost curve, but also, it has to think about the midstream, downstream and its marketing investment. So Bruce is thinking right across the value chain, looking at improving its cost and looking at how we continue to evolve the business for the long term. 
And I know 1 or 2 old timers from  De Beers is and it's not like it used to be. Well, it can't be. We're not about shaping this business for the last 20 years, we're about shaping this business for the next 20 years. And so Bruce has work that we'll talk about in the next little while because, obviously, we have to take all our employees through is about improving our costs. It's about making sure structurally the business is set for the long term, and it's about making sure that we're the key supplier getting the right price for a rare product that's becoming rarer. And certainly, we think it's positioned for the long term."

And then the second question, just on what you mentioned in the earlier on the Mark about your views on met coal and iron ore sort of changing market dynamics, does that make your view about -- you said capital allocation decisions will change, but I'm curious what your views would be then on a Moranbah, Grosvenor debottlenecking. And also curious just your thoughts on this cut stable project approval, given that sort of view you've just given on capital allocation."

What you'll find in the [indiscernible] approval, Timber and the guys have actually used carbon costs. And we've costed that in the proposal against the South African carbon costs. Look, I've seen carbon cost estimates ranging from $20 a tonne to $100 a tonne. I still think that's a moving feast. We look at all the scenarios and try and work out what we think it's worth. But if I just looked at the diesel -- current diesel costs, capital costs and operating costs. In looking at the solar array that we're looking at for Mogalakwena, oversizing, providing our primary power source to the plant, and then using excess capacity to generate hydrogen in a closed-loop system and then running our trucks, and it's -- the truck that we're looking at is a fuel cell battery hybrid, it will be the first off-highway truck in the world designed by the Anglo American people, we've had some people supporting us, but our teams actually designed it. We believe the fuel cost on the total cost basis will be actually lower than what it costs us to run that system with energy off the SA grid and diesel fuel imported at global prices. We're not going to talk capital numbers yet. We will start actually explaining those numbers when we start presenting our sustainability strategies and when we talk to the detail on Mogalakwena. So we'll start unpacking the detail towards year-end. And as we go forward. Stephen, I see your hand up. You'd like to say something?"

And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. A",353,"Yes. Thanks, Mark. And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. And I think you'll see more and more of that coming through as you get scale and volume in that sort of segment. A couple of other quick comments on that. Yes, a lot of the things that will help us get there are actually really good for our business anyway. So some of the technology improvements, the cause particle flotation, et cetera, the way we crush is good for the business and good from an ESG perspective. So they're actually a really integrated spend that helped drive you down that course. And obviously, some of these contracts and developments would be a question of, well, who spends the capital and how do you pay for that over time, not all of those things will necessarily be us spending the capital, but us getting the benefit of the outcome of that. 
Maybe then just a couple of comments, and I'll throw it back to Mark on met coal. Again, capital allocation, we often do think in a 5, 7, 10 year world as we allocate capital. And so met coal, I think, will still be a major part of particularly high-grade met coal, a major part of the steel production for 15-plus years. So we're still well inside that in terms of capital allocation. The Moranbah and Grosvenor debottlenecking, no, that won't be impacted by that. The rapid payback and returns on that, it's really an expansion and efficiencies through the wash plant that will give us the additional volume and returns. And cap stay was south, as Mark mentioned, took full account of carbon pricing, community expectations, water, all of those sorts of things in our consideration and also has a fairly rapid payback through a 5 to 7-year period. So again, well inside, and again, a high-grade product like we currently produce on Kumba. Mark? Thank you."

Thanks, Stephen. That was a good summary. In to sort of capture that in a final comment, we believe that the capital implications are not significant on the basis that there will be a combination of what we what we invest in and Stephen's point around third-party supply, and there are people that are providing different types of structures and deals where they can have shared installations that will reduce our upfront capital cost and are very competitive from an operating cost perspective, and we're in a number of those conversations. And we've seen some of those already come through. And on the operating costs are actually then lower than what we've got as infrastructure in place. 
So it works both ways. And as Stephen said, Moranbah, Grosvenor debottlenecking, obviously, we'll get through the investigations and understand the key issues on Grosvenor. It will change. I suspect a few things the way we operate. But the debottlenecking is a pretty straightforward project. It's got a rapid payback as has Cap Stifel and other types of projects. So we'll continue to invest in the business, but you won't see big step-outs in terms of substantial new projects they're more likely to be in other parts of the business, if I could make it, it's a lean towards other parts of the business as opposed to a massive step out at this point in time. Because the prognosis is still good in met coal and iron ore, but prices will track down, we think, the opportunity to make be
returns will shift into those areas over time."

We've got good opportunity, yes, in met coal, but De Beers and obviously, the ship. But it's a competition for capital. We make judgments about what we think the markets will look like. So nothing less than you would expect. In terms of the PGM business, Mogalakwena quite has a few different types of options. We've got the ability to expand the open cut. And with the new exploration work, we've also got the ability to tee off with shallow declines into high-grade underground ore bodies that give us the ability to utilize our processing infrastructure more effectively and those costs from those operations are very competitive, and in some cases, lower than the open cut operating costs. 
So as we've done our exploration, we've developed a whole new range of possibilities and options and so where we should spend in the mine versus on the processing side is we're just trying to look at getting that balance right. We're also creating a lot of low-grade material out of Mogalakwena as well, which is very low-cost material when you put it through the process. So we're getting those balances right to get the capital allocation right. So at the end of the year, we'll be talking about the preferred option for Mogalakwena, and it will likely be a bit more from the open cut future developments in underground, and there will be some processing configuration changes, and we'll try and utilize our facilities with more of our own feed because that will drive us further down the cost curve. So that's 1 example, Tyler. I could go through more, but I think you'll get the flavor of where we're going."

Firstly, from an operating perspective, and I use [indiscernible] as an example, our shovel productivities have improved 40% to 50% and the team is on the trail and chasing some of our best-performing operations. So they'll continue to improve. And so we're taking those into account, the changes that are upper the niche productivities, our productivity is across all parts of the operation and looking at continuing to reduce our costs in those parts of the business. That's one. Our overheads, our administration has always got to look at tightening up and trimming those costs. We also want to invest more in diamonds and in our brands. Our brand's forever mark have been growing much quicker than the rest of the industry, and it's very clear that you can get what we think is fair value for your products, if you've got the right brand and people understand what you're trying to do with the product. And so our investment strategy around marketing is very important. Given the last 2 or 3 years, and the positive growth we've seen in forevermark, that's also a very important part of our strategy. So understanding right the way through to the consumers as well as the position with our customers. Now our site holders are our direct customers. They are part of the change. We are consulting them in the process. And so they will be part of the restructuring. 
Now to be fair to them, we would -- we think it's important to have those dialogues, but we are flagging. There's an important exercise that we've got to go through and making sure that they understand who will get what, how we'll position those conversations. And I'm not going to preempt what those conversations will look like. But again, the whole value chain has to keep evolving for the world that we have and how we're competing with other discretionary spend products. And so for us, it's a natural evolution. As I said earlier, it's not about the last 20 years, it's about what we see today and for the next 20 years. That's how we're creating  De Beers or continuing to transform the business."

I'm here slaving away at work. Stephen is setting in his backyard next to the pool.  So if we look at each other and we're juggling between the 2 of us, it's just making sure that we're coordinated. Hopefully, you're all used to the format by now. We're still developing and making sure we get it right. But the most important thing is that we are connected with you, give you a chance to ask questions as well. And from our point of view, make sure that we're accessible to our shareholders. 
We are open for business. 
So I'm on the first slide, which is the header. From our point of view, it's obviously been a very tough 6 months. COVID-19 is a new term we've all had to learn and adapt to. In our case, it obviously had -- it has obviously had a material impact on our operations and the business. But certainly, from our perspective, I think we finished the half strong. And we also believe that taking that improving performance into the second half will be the key to us delivering a much better full year result. 
In opening the presentation, I think it's also important to acknowledge all of our colleagues in Anglo American, acknowledge the communities with which we work, in which we operate and with which we work and the partnership we've had with so many members in the community and so many stakeholders across the board. Our WeCare program has become a cornerstone for our response to COVID, in which we focus on making sure that our people are looked after, that we're also playing our part in our local communities, even more so than we normally do, and I'll talk a little bit about that later. And from our point of view that we're making a real contribution.
At the same time, we've been working very hard to make sure that we protect the business, that we maintain business continuity, and we're rebuilding the operations after some pretty significant lockdowns in March and April. I guess the best way to show that will characterize that in numbers is in April. After the March lockdowns, we were producing at less than 60% of production capacity and by the end of June, we're at 90%. So the recovery continues. There's still got some -- we've still got some hard work to do. And I do expect that the second half may be a little bumpy, but certainly, we're in a very different place. And I think we've built a set of relationships with communities and governments, where they know and understand how we can help keep the economy going and at the same time, keep people safe. And I think that's the key to the future. And certainly, from our perspective, I think we've built that foundation and that trust with our communities and with our governments that does support us in going forward. 
So let's jump straight into the presentation. I'm going to go to Slide 3, which is the agenda, very simply put. We'll keep the order of play as usual. I'll talk about where we are today. With the world a more complex place, and I think it's important for you to know how we're dealing with the issues. Stephen will take you through the numbers and pull apart the detail, and then I will pick the ball back up and take you through how we see the forward look. And then we'll go to Q&A. 
So I'm now on Slide 4. As we should and always do, we open with safety, health and environment. At first glance, if you look at where we've come from over the last 7 years, we've been significantly improving our performance in the business. In safety, about a 70% improvement in terms of our injury frequency rates, but even more important, our fatalities have dropped 93.5%. In the last 12 months, we've lost one colleague. That's one too many, but we're making progress from where we started. Secondly, in terms of health, we've improved our position 95% in eliminating serious health hazards throughout the business. And on environment, we've reduced our incidents by 97%. 
But when you talk about those issues, it's not simply about numbers. We've had some serious incidents in the first half, and we've just been bloody lucky we didn't lose a colleague in those incidents. And so we've improved the underlying performance, we still haven't delivered 0 incidents, and that's something that we're focused on, and we'll continue to improve. As you're aware, on the Moranbah longwall face, we had a ground fall. We've since recovered. We understand the issue, where we've not had the right technical design inputting into changing geotechnical conditions. We've actually changed the organization design to make sure that we've got that response. And we've also checked across the business in any other areas where we may be deficient in terms of the level of technical input, and I think we've straightened that issue out. I guess the proof is in the pudding. We ended up getting the wall away about 3 weeks earlier than our forecast after the fall, and the operation has been going well since. And certainly, the digitization work that Tony and the team have been doing with Seamus has helped improve our performance, and we have to keep improving.
In terms of the converter incident in platinum, Natascha and the team have already implemented a range of both physical and operating process controls, 8 in track. And again, we'll continue on our pathway to automation and the high -- installation of hard controls in those processes where we have elevated risk. I guess in both cases, the important thing to observe as well is that our secondary safety controls, that is the flags and making sure people were clear of those areas where there was a heightened risk, ensured that we didn't have any injuries through either of those incidents. And that's a very important issue for us and a good learning as well. 
In terms of Grosvenor, the ignition of gas on the longwall face, it would appear, the gas was flushed through a wasteful. In looking at the other elements and learnings, we're still very much in an investigation process as is the department. But most importantly, our 5 colleagues that were injured are now making a good recovery. Some are already home. But again, we're making sure that we're working with the families and helping them on the rehabilitation path. I guess, most importantly, and again, the key point to stress for us as a business is that we have to continue to improve and get to 0. 
On health, our WeCare program was our central focus in 2020, obviously with COVID. I will talk to that a little bit. And on the environment, we've had one incident, which was a repeat spill due to heavy range in South Africa in one of the tailings areas in the Base Metals Refinery. And again, introducing some additional engineering work to make sure that we don't have that exposure on a go-forward basis. 
So for us, the other 2 milestones that were important for us in 2020, on the environmental side, was the confirmation that we believe we can get to carbon neutrality by 2040 and that we would have at least 8 operations carbon neutral by 2030. I think that -- I think the thing that characterizes us differently is we are willing and will show you when we meet a pathway to carbon neutrality that's quite unique and different in the industry. And our 2040 date is certainly leading edge in terms of industry and making sure we get there in good time. 
That obviously -- and that move obviously coincides with our announcement on the demerger or our intention of a potential demerger of thermal coal operations in South Africa in the 2 to 3-year time frame. All very important milestones for us and our business and very much a statement about where the portfolio is going over the next few years. 
And going to the next slide, which is Slide 5 in your deck. Again, the numbers show how challenging and volatile times have been and we didn't help ourselves with those self-inflicted interruptions. But we've still maintained our focus on improving the business and making sure that we're putting our best foot forward wherever we can. 
While production was down 11%, I think it's more -- it's very important to understand that at the same time -- and with the big lockdowns, we lost 20% of our working hours during the course of the first half. As I said, we were down -- or we lost almost 50% of our workforce at the end of -- towards the end of March and into April. And on a full half basis, we lost about 20% of the time available to us in terms of our production teams. So the 11% production drop is credible in that context. 
Our operating costs, 4% lower than we were last year, has obviously had some help from foreign exchange. But again, at the operating level, we were still down 3% or 4% against where we were last year on an apples for apples basis. And so I think the progress we've made in continuing to improve our productivity has been very solid. And again, when I adjust for hours worked, our productivities were actually up 7%. So the underlying performance was strong, but obviously, big impact from lockdowns and the other measures we've had to take as a consequence of COVID. 
Stephen  will take you through the balance sheet details a little further. So I won't dwell any longer on the actual operating numbers other than to make one point. We've delivered a dividend consistent with our policy, the 40% payout ratio, and that's important. And so from our perspective, we've maintained faith with our shareholders as we said we would. 
In terms of defining and describing our response to COVID, we'll talk about the response in 3 parts. Firstly, and through our WeCare program, we focused on prevention, that is keeping people safe and hoping that we can keep them away from exposure in terms of the virus. And that includes our work in the community. Secondly, in having an exposure, how do we respond? How do we sort the business and make sure we configure the business to continue operations. And then obviously, while we're doing all of that work with the communities and doing all of that work with governments, we've also got one eye trained very firmly on how we recover the business over time. And as I said, getting to 90% production by the end of June was very important to us. And I'm still sure that it will be a bit of a bumpy ride through the second half. 
But the most important thing is we've established a relationship with our communities. We've established trust. We've established a relationship with governments. We're providing advice and support on how they can deal with issues. We've actually designed new ways of operating, social distancing. We have our own app, Engage, which every 1 of our employees has that helps them understand our expectations and also provides a platform to communicate how we can improve things. And so the tailoring of the business has been something quite unique. And from our perspective, there were many positives that come out of the learnings that we've been through in terms of the business. 
And so the final point I'd make in terms of our response and how we've connected with our communities, this is not new to us. It's in our DNA. It's consistent with our purpose, which is around reimagine mining to improve people's lives. And again, the learnings that we've had are significant and will certainly improve both our approach in connection with our communities and, on a longer-term basis, in terms of the way we see efficiencies and how we can work differently and more efficiently across the business.  
I'm now on Slide 7. Just to reinforce how far we've come in the last few years. In 2012 and with materially higher commodity prices, our industrial margin was sitting around 30%. In 2019, and with -- it was almost 10% lower prices, we actually delivered margins of 42%.  If I adjust for commodity price mix, we would have been at around 47% if we were back in 2012. So the improvements have been significant, and they've been sustained in the business. Our operating costs are [ 30% ] lower. That's in nominal terms. And our productivities are double where they were back in 2012. 
For us, the first half was also impacted by the delay in sales. Obviously, not much going on in the diamond sector or the luxury goods sector. In PGMs, obviously the converter incident had an impact on what we get out, but we'll see both of those improve in the second half. And so we expect our sales to start picking up and certainly, the cash flow position to change to the upside as we continue to improve our sales and pull stock out of working capital. 
More specifically and talking about diamond, the diamond market and why we believe it's structurally attractive. As you know, the diamond market has been growing in the last 10 years. And 2009 was the last recession or the last major recession. And we've seen consistent sales growth over that period.  It's also important to note that we've seen consistent supply growth through that period. And that's something that's changing across the industry. Today, we've seen continuing improvement -- or we've seen a very tough start to the year, but we've seen continuing efficiency improvements in the business. But with the market where it is, we've actually pulled back our production more than 20%. And we've seen the other major player in the market pull its production back as well. And we also expect supply to fall away as smaller operators have found it more difficult to operate in these times. And with companies closing operation through resource depletion -- because you can't forget we haven't seen a major new discovery in diamonds for the last 10 years, we think structurally, the prognosis is very good. Our research tells us that the market is strong. And in our case, when you look at China, which was first impacted by COVID, we saw virtually no sales in the first quarter. Yet in March and June of this year, we've seen sales actually exceed last year's May and June figures. And the sense we have from interacting with people on the ground is very positive.  
Now we certainly don't expect Europe and the U.S. to recover as quickly. For us, a key selling part of the year is in the period from Thanksgiving through to the new -- or through to Christmas and the New Year in the U.S. We would expect to see things pick up materially by then. But again, we're not ones to try and forecast in a month. Our stock position will be such that we can respond quickly to a change in the market. And certainly, we'd expect to start to see stocks running down in the fourth quarter.  But again, I'll let Stephen talk to that in terms of where we are. But given that we've pulled production back, and we see a continuing depletion in the midstream, because there are sales actually occurring, we think the business will be in a good position by year-end and certainly be ready for a much stronger 2021. 
Finally, again, with supplies falling away somewhere between 15% and 20% over the next 2 or 3 years, we expect our rare product to become much rarer. And so for us, structurally, we think diamonds is in a good place. 
On a broader scale and across the business -- and I'm now on Slide 9. Our copper business has done extremely well in the first half. Great performances from Collahuasi. Los Bronces is actually starting to get some rains. So that's good news. Our costs have dropped from $1.35 to $1.07 a pound.  And yes, foreign exchanges has played a part, but our operating costs have been really improving at the operating level on an apples-for-apples basis. And so thrilled with what's happening. 
And remember, with Quellaveco and other incremental improvements, we expect to grow our business 50%. With Quellaveco making a Q1 cost contribution to the operations, you're going to see us grow the business and reduce our operating costs. Really thrilled with the work the guys have done.  
In PGMs, again, we've positioned strongly for the recovery. We've got the second or the standby converter operating. We will have the refurbished converter operating in Q4. And so again, that will continue the recovery. And again, with Mogalakwena, almost at full rate, Amandelbult at about 70% and Natascha focusing very strongly on the stability and the performance of the processing operations, I think we're in good shape. 
We are still seeing infections around the communities in and around our platinum operations. But with recovery of people that had been infected actually outnumbering new infections, we're actually seeing a drift -- positive drift back into the operations with people. So again, we think we're dealing and managing the issues well, and we're seeing people return to work. 
Across Bulks, again, another solid response, particularly pleasing with the Minas-Rio. Our ramp up through the half, I think we were about 21% of where we were last year.  We actually touched nominal capacity in March. So great performance at Minas-Rio. 
The nickel operations also in Brazil have done exceptionally well. Seamus and the guys obviously had the Grosvenor incident in Australia, but now Moranbah and the other operations are doing well. Kumba, great recovery after the lock down in March. Timber and the team have done a great job and you will see in those results as they reported yesterday.  
I'd also like to make a special comment and commend our Bulks team or, in particular, the marketing team in Bulks and across the board. They've done a great job in getting our product to market. And in particular, when we had the issue with the converter, we were able to satisfy all of our customer needs in the PGM space. And I think that was a remarkable piece of work. And that is also why people probably haven't got our earnings forecast absolutely right because the marketing team have made a great contribution.  
So for the second half, we believe the operations are heading into more stable and capable territory. And certainly, we think the second half should be a much better half for us.  
And with that, I'll hand across to Stephen. Stephen, you can see? You're on."

And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on h",1374,"Great. Thanks, Mark. And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on how we expect the balance sheet to respond from here. 
While I'm on the balance sheet, really pleased to see the lifting of the South African exchange control restrictions that was also announced back in February. We've managed costs tightly through the period, but sustainably, it's helped underpin our earnings. We've been able to exercise a degree of flexibility in CapEx to help protect our cash flows where needed. But importantly, we've done all of this in a really sustainable way, fully funding our stay-in-business capital and not compromising our growth projects.  
So looking at the numbers, it was always going to be a volatile period, but they reflect all of the hard work across the whole Anglo American team. An EBITDA of $3.4 billion, despite an 11% impact on production. And that's really benefited from the transformation process that we've been through for the last 7 years. It's really given us a solid operational base. 
EPS at $0.72 a share. And off the back of that, a $0.28 dividend based on our 40% payout policy. Unit costs, down 4%, with some help from FX. But remember, that is off a lower production volume. So some really good performance at an important time for us. CapEx $1.8 billion. And I'll talk to cash flow and working capital a little bit later.  
So moving to Slide 12. Looking at the breakdown of the $3.4 billion across the business unit. As you would expect, very limited earnings from diamonds, given the extent of the lockdown right across the whole diamond value chain. And just to remind you, we did give flexibility to our customers, particularly through Q2. 
Really good performance from copper, as Mark touched on, in an environment where we had slightly softer prices. Some challenges at Los Bronces with water. But production back on track and traveling very strongly with C1 cash cost of $1.07 a pound. 
PGM is obviously heavily affected by the converter plant outage but strong earnings, when you consider this really closer to 1 quarter sale rather than 2. And again, full complements to the marketing team who managed to juggle those production challenges, sourcing material in a tight market and meeting our customers' demand with all of the uncertainty that they were also going through.  
Bulks benefiting from the great work at Minas-Rio, good recovery at Kumba post the lockdowns and definitely helped by the stronger iron ore price. In the Bulks, partly offset by lower prices of met coal and the operational issues that Mark has spoken to.  
So if we turn to Slide 13 and the drivers of EBITDA. Firstly, price. Some ups and downs across met coal, thermal coal and copper that I've spoken to. But broadly offset by the benefit that we see in the weaker producer currencies. The impact of COVID, approximately USD 1.1 billion, largely from consumer demand affecting diamonds and the South African lockdowns that we had through that March-April period at Kumba, PGMs and thermal coal.  
We took a considered and staged approach at each site. We felt it was appropriate, also considering the community and country aspects, always with health and safety as our #1 priority.  
The outage of ACP at PGMs reduced EBITDA by $0.6 billion and together with $0.4 billion in relation to the disruptions at met coal. So putting all of those things aside, the rest of the business actually performed quite well, led by copper and Minas-Rio, in particular. Hence, the $0.4 billion improvement driven by those 2 sites.  
Turning to Slide 14 on the balance sheet. We -- as I said, we entered the start of the period, a very, very strong position. Net debt to EBITDA of 0.5x at the start of the period. And there was 2 primary factors across the 6 months that saw net debt increase. So firstly, the allocation of capital towards growth, $0.4 billion at Quellaveco and $0.7 billion with the acquisition of a crop nutrients business as we acquired Sirius. Secondly, we had a $1.4 billion buildup of working capital across the half. Diamonds at $0.5 billion and PGMs also at $0.5 billion. 
We had some shorter-term weather impacts just towards the end of June at copper in Kumba. So we do expect working capital should run down through the second half. So Diamond is probably more over a 6 to 12 month period, depending on markets. PGM is fairly substantially over the next 6 to 9 months. And the copper and Kumba miner bill should clear in Q3. Also, helpfully, from a balance sheet perspective, the lifting of South African exchange controls, and that's now in the process of being implemented and developed. A really pleasing development. As I've said previously, the currency controls that used to exist didn't have a major practical or a significant impact on us. But we do welcome the simplicity in capital structure and the move towards a more typical OECD regime.  I think it also sends a really strong positive message about the country's desire to promote investment and growth. 
So as a result, net debt of $7.6 billion, that's around 1.1x EBITDA, well within our guided range. Now obviously, as we look forward, all subject to the normal caveats, particularly around prices, exchange rates and any impact from COVID, but we would generally expect that number to trend downwards from here towards year-end.
Turning to CapEx on Slide 15. We're staying with our revised guidance, down by $1 billion to $4 billion, to $4.5 billion. And that does include the $300 million of year 1 spend at the Woodsmith project following the Sirius acquisition.  
The decrease in capital driven from a number of factors: weaker local exchange rates; some flexibility in the timing of our critical projects; and obviously, staying focused on our staying business capital spend. That reduction does include $300 million reduction in Quellaveco, and Mark will touch on that a little bit later. But importantly, because of the strength of the balance sheet, we've been able to make every decision for every asset for the right health and safety reason and for the right long-term economic outcome. At the same time, our brownfield projects, the diamond vessel in Namibia and Aquila in met coal remain on track and on budget. And you would have seen our recent announcement of a life extension project at Kumba at the Kolomela mine site. 
So clearly, on Slide 16, we remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation. And so to the scorecard for the half. Over the last 6 months, we maintained our base dividend, $600 million for the final dividend from 2019. And we allocated capital to some discretionary options. So growth capital in total, $0.8 billion for Sirius acquisition and $6 billion on our other growth projects. And we also saw the finalization of the additional shareholder return. So $200 million from the share buyback program.  
So stepping back on Slide 17. Yes, a volatile few months, but we're well placed, and it still remains about balance. We reinstated the dividend in '17, and since then, we have returned $5 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our balance sheet target of no more than 1.5x net debt to EBITDA through the cycle. All of that underpins our growth profile. Our P101 and technology development and the marketing focus on margins allows us to invest sensibly across the business. And that, in turn, will drive our growth in production, EBITDA and cash flow. 
Quellaveco project in Peru, the brownfields project, should deliver a combined 20% to 25% production growth by 2023. In copper equivalent terms, that's really market leading. We believe our long-term EBITDA margins from the mining business can reach that 45% level based on long-term consensus commodity prices. So a real commitment to get the balance right.  In terms of balance sheet, returns to shareholders, importantly, relationships with stakeholders and the discretionary allocation of surplus cash flows. 
Mark, back to you."
409115,677161141,2051049,"Anglo American plc, H1 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for",1951,"Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for a long time. And certainly, the work that we've done is starting to be recognized in terms of some of the new industries that are coming out. And our top rating in the FTSE in terms of what we're doing on the ground has been recognized. So from our point of view, all of those things matter. 
Consistent with that approach, and I'm on Slide 19, our work on the portfolio starts obviously around Quellaveco in Peru. Now prior to the onset of COVID-19 in mid-March, we were tracking somewhere between 3 and 4 months ahead of the program. The guys have been doing a fantastic job. When the national quarantine was imposed, the majority of the project's 10,000 strong workforce were demobilized in line with the government's request and asked to head home. So we've helped people get back to home. Construction work, as a consequence, was significantly slowed. And whilst we maintained some critical -- works on critical items, we were substantially stopped across the board. 
With quarantine extended, we then decided to extend the lockdown for 3 months to give a chance for the country to get on top of COVID and, at the same time, so that we could minimize our outgoing cash expenditures with the view that we would then remobilize when we could put in place the workforce and deliver on full productivity. We thought that was the most effective way that we could contribute to the health and safety issues as well as make sure the project, when we hit the button, was able to run as hard as we could.  
So in taking that strategy, we're now on a restart, and it's a staged restart. We've estimated the cost of demobilization, remobilization and the cost of the structural changes we've made across the organization and how we've rescheduled to make sure we reduce the peak of workforce through the process. And in doing that, we've adjusted the financial estimate for the project to between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion. Now that leaves us with some contingency on the expectation but it still will be a bit of a bumpy ride over the next few months, as we see secondary infections, those sorts of things. But we think we've catered to those properly. 
And at the same time, we still think it's quite reasonable, and our forecast of delivering in 2022 remains on track. In fact, we're on track to the base schedule although we've had to give back, obviously, the big gains we made prior to March. But again, a lot of work is going on to continue to improve that work. 
The last 3 months, we've also been focused on improving the way we bring the operation up through commissioning. And so we haven't completed that work, but we've got some positives there. So we believe we can offset any cost issues and pull back some of that improved value through the way we operate through commissioning.
So I'm pretty pleased with the work the guys have done, and I think we're in really good shape.
In terms of crop nutrients, the U.K., despite a really tough period in lockdown, we were able to get back to work relatively quickly, implemented our social distancing rules. And where we've been somewhere like 30% or 40% above on productivity in the underground operation by changing and reconfiguring. We're not quite at that level above our plan, but we are on track to deliver the planned works for the year. That is the $300 million. So Chris and the guys have done a fantastic job. And as we look at the business and we look at the market potential, we're happier today than we were on the day we bought the asset on the basis of what we've seen. The guys have done a great job. Yes, there'll be some technical adjustments but they're at the margin. We think, generally, the team has got the configuration right. And from our point of view, the market and the interest we've had in the market for the product has really been positive, particularly when you think about the new world in terms of fertilizers and what we'll have to see in agriculture in terms of smart use of fertilizers. We think the products will be producing are certainly made-to-order for that new world.  So very happy with where we are on Woodsmith.  
In terms of the transition from thermal coal, I think it's important to remember that as we transition out of thermal coal, we're building crop nutrients. And the crop nutrients business probably has got double the potential contribution it can make to the business. So we think that's a pretty good swap. In thermal coal, we've already reduced our footprint by 55%, back in '15, '16 when we sold assets that we didn't think could make a material contribution in the longer term. So We're well on the way. Today, it represents 5% of the EBITDA across the business and probably reducing over time, given the price forecast. We expect to be out of the business within 2 to 3 years. And from our point of view, that's a good place to be. 
But at the same time, we've got to acknowledge that they are and remain low-cost competitive assets, albeit with a relatively shorter mine life than the balance of our assets across the portfolio. But a good pack of assets. Likely a demerger within the next couple of years. We think that's the right decision for Anglo American.  
In terms of our broader portfolio and its positioning in the world that we're looking at in terms of the future, we're certainly positioned to contribute to an environmental-led new materials demand. We've seen the early evolution of electric vehicles and some of the challenges of energy storage. Now we're seeing widespread investment plans in hydrogen, first in China and demand in the automotive sector. We're seeing, obviously, buses in Britain using hydrogen. And now in Europe, we're seeing a much broader application and pull for hydrogen products. 
We've been central to the promotion of hydrogen as the new fuel source. We're a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. And certainly from our point of view, and our involvement in PGMs, gives us a vested interest in making sure that we help support growth in the industry. 
For us, you'll be aware that we're looking at introducing a solar array in South Africa to generate -- or use renewables to generate primary energy, but we'll oversell -- oversize those units and generate hydrogen so we can start converting the major truck fleets to hydrogen consumption as well.  
So from our perspective, it's a great place to be. And most importantly, over the same period and with a greater use of renewables, we also improve our cost structures by reducing energy consumption by 30% by 2030, which is also part of -- and one of the most important drivers of our cost-reduction strategy as well. So one plus one gets three, in terms of what we think hydrogen and other new developments will contribute in terms of our world.  
On Slide 23, you'll see our conversation around having an active route to a greener world and from our point of view, that's where we're going as a business. This approach fits with our commitment towards the environment and minimizing our direct impact and footprint in terms of the communities around us. 
We've committed to making the business carbon neutral by 2040 earlier than most, and that by 2030, we'll have at least 8 operations that will be carbon neutral. Again, it will be a combination of solar, wind and other renewable sources connected to hydrogen and also battery power so that we create closed-loop systems. And the pathway is very clear. The detailed design is still in the works, but we're also starting to move on the pilots that we're looking at developing to demonstrate those pathways. And the platinum business will be 1 of the first places that we develop. And in fact, we'll have our first off-highway truck on hydrogen during the course of this year.
Our new technology and innovation work is also central to this footprint. That 30% energy reduction includes implementation of bulk sorting, coarse particle flotation, bulks orders. We've got in 3 operations already through copper, PGMs and nickel. We've also got coarse particle flotation units being built in the copper business in Chile as we speak. And again, as we go further down line, looking at reducing our water consumption by 50%. And so really changing the nature of the operations, the footprint for the operations, and we hope, creating a model for the industry that will drive us all towards a much greener future and a much more significant contribution to a green future for the planet.
On Slide 24, we talk to the numbers in a very simple way. We're building and evolving a high-quality mix of assets that are suited to future demand and we expect to see improving margins as a consequence of those switch. So a consumer world, an electrified world, a greener world. And from our point of view, our cleaner, greener world products will make up 65% of our portfolio over the next few years. And certainly, from our point of view, even with our contribution in Bulks, we'll have high quality, highly efficient iron ore and met coal, which will make, again, another efficiency and cleaner contribution to the making of steel over the longer term.
On Page 25, we talk to delivery. Like all journeys to a much better place, the road is always not a smooth -- or is not as always smooth as you'd like, but there is no doubt in our progress and our continuing commitment to outpace our competitors in growth and continuing business improvement. As we have along the journey, we will keep learning and getting better. 
And we continue to measure success in sustainability through 3 primary lenses: first, effectiveness. Over the long term, we believe those companies that can generate better than 10% free cash flow will provide the ability to pay dividends and grow their business. And I'm not talking about the next 2 or 3 years, we're talking about the next 10 to 20 years. That's the business we're building. And as we broaden the contribution across our portfolio, you've got a portfolio set for long-term performance. Measuring the efficiency in how we generate those cash returns is just as critical for shareholders. And so our return on capital employed targets make sure that we keep our eye on capital discipline and that we don't throw money at simply generating cash and at the same time, destroying value.  
And being sustainable is absolutely key. So we have our 7 performance pillars: safety; environment; social performance; talent pool, making sure we've got the right people; production and resource base, and the life of assets we have in the portfolio; unit cost position, we continue to improve against our competitors; and ultimately, it's about having a conservative balance sheet that allows us to do the right things and continue to make sensible investments for the long term. 
And so with that, as a differentiated company in terms of assets, capabilities and the ability to deliver long-term returns, that's Anglo American, I'm very happy to take questions."

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work.

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work. So when you get those numbers, they balance out pretty well. 
On the carbon neutrality approach, I think, firstly, a comment on pathways. You'll see in Brazil, where we've signed long-term contracts with renewable energy suppliers, doing similar work in Chile. We've got lots of sun in Chile. We've got lots of sun in South Africa and in Queensland. So we want to use solar energy as much as we can. The idea of then oversizing, converting to hydrogen, creating closed loops with battery technologies as well, is pretty well been thought through. And you've got to remember, we're also looking at dropping our energy consumption through the efficiency work that we're doing at a technical level. So I think there's no doubt that we've got a complete solution pretty well thought through, and I think that's what puts us ahead, Liam. 
In terms of the 2040 target, again, we think we're on a good track to get there. We haven't relied on offsets to actually get to those numbers because of all of the work we're doing on the front end. I mean, we've been putting the right people on the ground, working all of these solutions out to come up with the position we've taken. Certainly, that leaves us with the ability to look at offsets, if needed. But we really want to drive the business to make a better contribution. In my view, offsets are sort of cheating a little bit in that you're using someone else's credits to cover your own ability or inability to get to 0. So the focus for Anglo American is to get there under our own steam, if you pardon the pun. But at the same time, if we need to do a little bit on the offset side, we'll obviously keep that option open. 
And don't forget with crop nutrients, the idea of improving agricultural production means the world is going to have to use less land for agriculture to actually hit its carbon neutral targets. And so from our point of view, crop nutrients is a significant contributor to what difference we can make and given we've got such a small carbon footprint.  So we've thought it through pretty well to get to those numbers."

It's around improving energy efficiency, which improves our cost structures. It's about looking at developing closed loop systems that allows us to operate in a clean way. The offset is a third option, but it hasn't played a major role in how we see ourselves getting to the end result."

So there was a bit of a view coming from investors that Anglo was getting quite confident and quite confident operationally. And I think some people even used the word swagger. And more recently, unfortunately, we've had some fairly serious operational incidents at both Amplat and in met coal. And today, I have the same investors asking me has something gone wrong in Anglo? So I'm just wondering, can you give us some color on the operational shortcomings that contributed to these incidents? And specifically, I'm interested to know how you might be adjusting your operating model or at least the implementation of the operating model to address these incidents?"

In our view -- we're about 50% of the way through the implementation of the detail in the operating model. Where we start is what we call work management, which is about how we get work done, how we plan work and making sure we're delivering as per plan. And that's been the driver between safety improvement, the 90-odd percent, the environmental improvement, the 90%, the health improvement, 90%. And that work has gone well. We call that work management. 
In terms of operating strategy and the detailed technical design work, there's been a lot of good work there, but we're probably still only 50% of the way up to where we want to be. And that includes the change in the control systems we've got. For example, in platinum. We've still got a lot of stuff that's done manually. So there's a lot more automation required. 
And for example, Natascha has introduced 8 new both physical controls and procedural controls in the converter to make sure we don't have the same incident. So we're still working through. We're still learning. We're still a work-in-progress in many ways. To be specific, at Moranbah on the longwall, the area that we started the wall had a little bit different geology, but we applied a standard design. What we've done now is said, look, any of those designs -- and this goes right across the board or any of the major cutback designs, actually have to be signed off 1 level above. Because where you've got a change in circumstance, you really do make sure you've got all the issues covered. So I think that's an important change. And the new design configuration worked extremely well. We got away 3 weeks earlier and the operation has been going well. 
Now we've been implementing digitalization technologies in the management of the longwall, and that's improved our productivity to more than doubled. But there's still more work to be done. The Grosvenor issue in -- call it, a bit of a different issue. And I know a lot of technical people won't understand the issue. We don't think it was an operating issue in terms of the way we would handle things on a day-to-day basis. What appears as though we've had a major fall in the waste area, which all operations have, where you do have some accumulation of gas, where everybody has it. And it's actually flushed, that gas onto the longwall face. The question is what may have ignited the gas? And that's where the investigation work now is going on. And we'll find that solution. And I think, ultimately, that will require changes across the industry in the way some of these technologies work. But again, I'm going to let the investigation finish its work. But I think there'll be some changes in the industry. 
In terms of the ACP, again, there were some procedural issues and there were some control issues. I think Natascha is right on that. And to those that I've been talking to in the last few months, my -- I've explained the selection of Natascha in terms of her background in making sure we improve the operation, stability and consistency out of platinum. And even though we've had massive change in the portfolio, our consistency hasn't been as good as it could be. And that's where the focus is. So I'd like to say that the 90% improvement that we've seen across all the dimensions indicates that we've gone somewhere very different to where we are. But we've still got a way to go. We're still not as good as we would like to be, and we're still not at 0 incident. 
So we'll learn, we'll apply the lessons, and we'll keep getting better as we should. Good question."

Mark, I'll deal with the first one, and I'll make some opening comments on the second and then maybe throw it to you. 
So in terms of working capital, if you look at the sort of 3 primary areas, diamonds -- as Mark said, will clearly be market dependent. And it's hard to pick a month, but we're confident the market will come back and demand will flow through quite strongly when it does come back. So without picking the month, whether it happens in November, December or January, February, I'm not too bothered by it. It's really about market coming back, and I know the team are looking at how they can sell diamonds in a different way given the circumstances. So they're working hard on that one. 
On PGMs, given that we're now back up and running at the ACP and the materials flowing out, I'd expect that to come back quite strongly over the next 6 to 9 months. And so you should see -- it may not be all of it, but a substantial portion of that $0.5 billion reverse between now and probably the end of Q1 in 2021.
And copper and Kumba really was just about swells or capacity at the port in Kumba's case. So I think that should close itself out back through Q3. So all things being equal, I'd love to think potentially, you're at least $0.5 billion, maybe a bit extra flushing out of that through the second half. But it is, with all the qualifications that you would expect in terms of prices of markets and further interruptions by COVID. But that's probably about the best guidance I can give you. It's more around timing than absolute amounts. 
In terms of -- just maybe your first comment on our cost guidance, I mean, clearly, some of the businesses have been impacted by the disruptions, and some of that's flowing through into cost structure. Met coal is probably a good example where that's flowing through quite directly into unit costs. And probably the currency hasn't helped in that case as the Aussie dollar strengthened against the U.S. 
In the other markets, yes, copper is probably the standout. Yes, we've seen quite a -- I don't know what the percentage would be, 20% movement in currencies through copper producing regions. That's clearly helped. And just looking across the others, again, there's no real comment there, given the limited sales through Brazil.  Yes, again, we've had some currency movement that's helped. It's probably more in the sort of 10% to 15% range. 
So where we've produced well, you've seen sustainable cost out. And, yes, that's been helped by foreign currency. There's no denying that. But you also have seen price movements. And so on Slide 13, I think you can see that those 2 things have largely offset 1 another between currency CPI and  price movements. And so there's a bit of give and take across each of those. So rather than just focusing on cost, as I often do, I'd also ask you to focus on the price movement as well. 
Mark, any comments from you on that?"

I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the as",459,"Yes. Look, again, another good question. I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the assets that we're operating, are on average doing 30% more in terms of production. And in terms of their actual performance, that group of assets is doing at least 20%. I think it's about 23%, 24% better on unit costs. So we're at another level of performance. And it's interesting our actual underlying performance is actually even better than that, but we're having a little less consistency because we're at a higher level of performance. 
Now people know there's a few of us in the business that are pretty forensic in the way we pull stuff apart and understand what's going wrong and what we need to do to get right. So we've obviously looked at the issues in coal and the ACP issue. But it's actually a much broader view. And we're looking at how we can improve the stability to take another 5% to 10% step on the operating cost side. And the two go hand-in-hand. 
So on the big improvements, we're continuing to make, we're giving about 60% back to inconsistency, and I'm talking about the last 12 months. So we're just working really hard with the teams to get the stability. And so on the basis of the first half, and Stephen stripped away COVID and other movements, we had about a $400 million improvement outside of platinum and met coal. There's about a 4 -- 3% to 4% underlying cost improvement in the business if we can get that stability across the business that we'll take into the new year. So that's what Tony is focusing on with the operating teams, is to get the stability. 
We're working at another level in terms of risks and automation. That work's ongoing with the digital work. So I'm hoping that we're taking 3% to 5% improvement that you're seeing some of it in the underlying performances into next year. But that's 1 we'll talk about at the end of the year once we've seen how far we've come along in terms of improving our stabilities. But the 1 thing I have to say, being in Anglo American is about constant improvement. And when we do have issues, we try and do everything we can to make sure we learn and we apply the lessons across the board. And we've stubbed our toe and we're in the process of making sure that we understand and apply those learnings. And again, we'll keep you posted on that progress over the next 6 months."

So I'll try and unpack them as quickly as I can and deal with each of them. 
Firstly, on the thermal coal transfer, certainly from South Africa, the response from the government has been very positive and constructive. So if we ultimately go down the demerger proposal, and that's the most likely route, we'll certainly, I think, do that in better than 2 years. Cerrejón, people know where we stand on Cerrejón. We will exit at some point. But we are also being very respectful of our 2 partners in terms of our processes. We maintain a dialogue. And at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, I think we'll be gone from there as well. Again, I don't want to be or can't be too hard on the timing of that. Because, again, we've got 2 other -- I was going to say, customers, 2 other competitors and 2 other colleagues that we have in that asset, we're making sure that we deal with that the right way. But again, we should be out of both in that time frame. Certainly, the South African change will be much quicker. 
In terms of met coal, look, the carbon issue is obviously a question. But I think most investors are a little more sophisticated than people give them credit for. They understand that steel is absolutely critical. And that you need met coal in the mix, and it will take time to make the changes. But there's no doubt that in terms of capital allocation, we keep an eye on when those changes and how those trends will change. We do for iron ore as well. Because we will see more recycling by 2035. We think steel will make -- steel recycling will make up 50% of the mix. We think iron ore starts to change shape by 2025. So with both iron ore and met coal, we'll keep an eye on capital allocation. We'll tend to operate and run to pull a bit more cash. And our new investments will go into those commodities or products that we think are longer term, the big game changers. And that's why we think we're very different to our competitors, we've got a much longer view. We've got a portfolio that's set up for the future. And certainly, we're making sure people are very clear that we're building this business for long-term performance. 
In terms of De Beers, being consistent on the different product side, in the last 10 years, De Beers have delivered around 10% sustainable free cash flow. So that's before it's growth CapEx. We're currently operating at about 27 million, 28 million carats. We can actually take that up to about 37 million, 38 million carats, if the market is strong. We expect supply to drop away, 15% to 20% in the next 2 or 3 years. You know about Argyle, and there are other changes in the market that are recurring. So structurally, we think the business is in good shape. We are, when you look at it, running the best diamond business in the world, and it has been for 90 years. So there's no reason for us to think differently about that. We think prices will likely be stronger on the basis of supply falling away. There hasn't been a major discovery for 10 years. 
But in terms of what Bruce is doing, the rest of the business has made significant improvement in our cost structures.  De Beers has made improvements, but it hasn't come as far down that cost curve, but also, it has to think about the midstream, downstream and its marketing investment. So Bruce is thinking right across the value chain, looking at improving its cost and looking at how we continue to evolve the business for the long term. 
And I know 1 or 2 old timers from De Beers say that it's not like it used to be. Well, it can't be. We're not about shaping this business for the last 20 years, we're about shaping this business for the next 20 years. And so Bruce has worked that we'll talk about in the next little while because, obviously, we have to take all our employees through it, is about improving our costs. It's about making sure structurally the business is set for the long term, and it's about making sure that we're the key supplier getting the right price for a rare product that's becoming rarer. And certainly, we think it's positioned for the long term."

And we've costed that in the proposal against the South African carbon costs. L",274,"Yes. Okay. Again, a lot in that, Ian. Let me pick up the issue of carbon cost. What you'll find in the Kapstevel approval, Timber and the guys have actually used carbon costs. And we've costed that in the proposal against the South African carbon costs. Look, I've seen carbon cost estimates ranging from $20 a tonne to $100 a tonne. I still think that's a moving feast. We look at all the scenarios and try and work out what we think it's worth. 
But if I just looked at the diesel -- current diesel costs, capital costs and operating costs, in looking at the solar array that we're looking at for Mogalakwena, oversizing, providing our primary power source to the plant, and then using excess capacity to generate hydrogen in a closed-loop system and then running our trucks, and it's -- the truck that we're looking at is a fuel cell battery hybrid -- it will be the first off-highway truck in the world designed by the Anglo American people, we've had some people supporting us, but our teams actually designed it. We believe the fuel cost on the total cost basis will be actually lower than what it costs us to run that system with energy off the SA grid and diesel fuel imported at global prices. We're not going to talk capital numbers yet. We will start actually explaining those numbers when we start presenting our sustainability strategies and when we talk to the detail on Mogalakwena. 
So we'll start unpacking the detail towards year-end and as we go forward. Stephen, I see your hand up. You'd like to say something?"

And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. A",351,"Yes. Thanks, Mark. And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. And I think you'll see more and more of that coming through as you get scale and volume in that sort of segment. 
A couple of other quick comments on that. Yes, a lot of the things that will help us get there are actually really good for our business anyway. So, yes, some of the technology improvements, the coarse particle flotation, et cetera, the way we crush is good for the business and good from an ESG perspective. So they're actually a really integrated spend that helped drive you down that course. 
And obviously, some of these contracts and developments would be a question of, well, who spends the capital and how do you pay for that over time, not all of those things will necessarily be us spending the capital, but us getting the benefit of the outcome of that.
Maybe then just a couple of comments, and I'll throw it back to Mark on met coal. Again, capital allocation, we often do think in a 5, 7, 10 year world as we allocate capital. And so, yes, met coal, I think, will still be a major part of particularly high-grade met coal. A major part of the steel production for 15-plus years. So we're still well inside that in terms of capital allocation. 
The Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, no, that won't be impacted by that. The rapid payback and returns on that, it's really an expansion in efficiencies through the wash plant that will give us the additional volume and returns. And Kapstevel south, as Mark mentioned, took full account of carbon pricing, community expectations, water, all of those sorts of things in our consideration and also has a fairly rapid payback through a 5 to 7-year period. So again, well inside, and again, a high-grade product like we currently produce on Kumba. 
Mark? Thank you."

Thanks, Stephen. That was a good summary. In -- to sort of capture that in a final comment, we believe that the capital implications are not significant on the basis that there will be a combination of what we invest in and Stephen's point around third-party supply, and there are people that are providing different types of structures and deals where they can have shared installations that will reduce our upfront capital cost and are very competitive from an operating cost perspective. And we're in a number of those conversations. And we've seen some of those already come through. 
And on the operating costs are actually then lower than what we've got as infrastructure in place.  So it works both ways. And as Stephen said, Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, obviously, we'll get through the investigations and understand the key issues on Grosvenor. It will change, I suspect, a few things the way we operate. But the debottlenecking is a pretty straightforward project. It's got a rapid payback as has Kapstevel and other types of projects. So we'll continue to invest in the business, but you won't see big step outs in terms of substantial new projects. They're more likely to be in other parts of the business, if I could make it. It's a lean towards other parts of the business as opposed to a massive step out at this point in time. Because the prognosis is still good in met coal and iron ore, but prices will track down, we think, the opportunity to make better
returns will shift into those areas over time."

But De Beers and obviously, the ship. But it's a competition for capital. We make judgments about what we think the markets will look like. So nothing less than you would expect. 
In terms of the PGM business, Mogalakwena has a few different types of options. We've got the ability to expand the open cut. And with the new exploration work, we've also got the ability to tee off with shallow declines into high-grade underground ore bodies that give us the ability to utilize our processing infrastructure more effectively. And those costs from those operations are very competitive, and in some cases, lower than the open cut operating costs. 
So as we've done our exploration, we've developed a whole new range of possibilities and options. And so where we should spend in the mine versus on the processing side is we're just trying to look at getting that balance right. We're also creating a lot of low-grade material out of Mogalakwena as well, which is very low-cost material, when you put it through the process. So we're getting those balances right to get the capital allocation right. So at the end of the year, we'll be talking about the preferred option for Mogalakwena. And it will likely be a bit more from the open cut future developments in underground, and there will be some processing configuration changes. And we'll try and utilize our facilities with more of our own feed because that will drive us further down the cost curve. So that's 1 example, Tyler. I could go through more, but I think you get the flavor of where we're going."

Look, the sight -- let me just talk in the broad. Firstly, from an operating perspective, and I use [ waning ] as an example, our shovel productivities have improved 40% to 50% and the team is on the trail and chasing some of our best-performing operations. So they'll continue to improve. And so we're taking those into account. The changes that are upper, the nicher productivities, our productivity is across all parts of the operation and looking at continuing to reduce our costs in those parts of the business. That's one. 
Our overheads, our administration has always got to look at tightening up and trimming those costs. We also want to invest more in diamonds and in our brands. Our brand's Forevermark have been growing much quicker than the rest of the industry, and it's very clear that you can get what we think is fair value for your products, if you've got the right brand and people understand what you're trying to do with the product. And so our investment strategy around marketing is very important. 
Given the last 2 or 3 years, and the positive growth we've seen in Forevermark, that's also a very important part of our strategy. So understanding right the way through to the consumers as well as the position with our customers. Now our Sightholder are our direct customers. They are part of the change. We are consulting them in the process. And so they will be part of the restructuring. 
Now to be fair to them, we would -- we think it's important to have those dialogues, but we are flagging. There's an important exercise that we've got to go through in making sure that they understand who will get what, how we'll position those conversations. And I'm not going to preempt what those conversations will look like. But again, the whole value chain has to keep evolving for the world that we have and how we're competing with other discretionary spend products. And so for us, it's a natural evolution. As I said earlier, it's not about the last 20 years, it's about what we see today and for the next 20 years. That's how we're creating De Beers or continuing to transform De Beers."

I'm here slaving away at work. Stephen is setting in his backyard next to the pool. So if we look at each other and we're juggling between the 2 of us, it's just making sure that we're coordinated. Hopefully, you're all used to the format by now. We're still developing and making sure we get it right. But the most important thing is that we are connected with you, give you a chance to ask questions as well. And from our point of view, make sure that we're accessible to our shareholders. 
We are open for business. 
So I'm on the first slide, which is the header. From our point of view, it's obviously been a very tough 6 months. COVID-19 is a new term we've all had to learn and adapt to. In our case, it obviously had -- it has obviously had a material impact on our operations and the business. But certainly, from our perspective, I think we finished the half strong. And we also believe that taking that improving performance into the second half will be the key to us delivering a much better full year result. 
In opening the presentation, I think it's also important to acknowledge all of our colleagues in Anglo American, acknowledge the communities with which we work, in which we operate and with which we work and the partnership we've had with so many members in the community and so many stakeholders across the board. Our WeCare program has become a cornerstone for our response to COVID, in which we focus on making sure that our people are looked after, that we're also playing our part in our local communities, even more so than we normally do, and I'll talk a little bit about that later. And from our point of view that we're making a real contribution.
At the same time, we've been working very hard to make sure that we protect the business, that we maintain business continuity, and we're rebuilding the operations after some pretty significant lockdowns in March and April. I guess the best way to show that will characterize that in numbers is in April. After the March lockdowns, we were producing at less than 60% of production capacity and by the end of June, we're at 90%. 
So the recovery continues. There's still got some -- we've still got some hard work to do. And I do expect that the second half may be a little bumpy, but certainly, we're in a very different place. And I think we've built a set of relationships with communities and governments, where they know and understand how we can help keep the economy going and at the same time, keep people safe. And I think that's the key to the future. And certainly, from our perspective, I think we've built that foundation and that trust with our communities and with our governments that does support us in going forward. 
So let's jump straight into the presentation. I'm going to go to Slide 3, which is the agenda, very simply put. We'll keep the order of play as usual. I'll talk about where we are today. With the world a more complex place, and I think it's important for you to know how we're dealing with the issues. Stephen will take you through the numbers and pull apart the detail, and then I will pick the ball back up and take you through how we see the forward look. And then we'll go to Q&A. 
So I'm now on Slide 4. As we should and always do, we open with safety, health and environment. At first glance, if you look at where we've come from over the last 7 years, we've been significantly improving our performance in the business. In safety, about a 70% improvement in terms of our injury frequency rates, but even more important, our fatalities have dropped 93.5%. In the last 12 months, we've lost one colleague. That's one too many, but we're making progress from where we started. Secondly, in terms of health, we've improved our position 95% in eliminating serious health hazards throughout the business. And on environment, we've reduced our incidents by 97%. 
But when you talk about those issues, it's not simply about numbers. We've had some serious incidents in the first half, and we've just been bloody lucky we didn't lose a colleague in those incidents. And so we've improved the underlying performance, we still haven't delivered 0 incidents, and that's something that we're focused on, and we'll continue to improve. As you're aware, on the Moranbah longwall face, we had a ground fall. We've since recovered. We understand the issue, where we've not had the right technical design inputting into changing geotechnical conditions. We've actually changed the organization design to make sure that we've got that response. 
And we've also checked across the business in any other areas where we may be deficient in terms of the level of technical input, and I think we've straightened that issue out. I guess the proof is in the pudding. We ended up getting the wall away about 3 weeks earlier than our forecast after the fall, and the operation has been going well since. And certainly, the digitization work that Tony and the team have been doing with Seamus has helped improve our performance, and we have to keep improving.
In terms of the converter incident in platinum, Natascha and the team have already implemented a range of both physical and operating process controls, 8 in track. And again, we'll continue on our pathway to automation and the high -- installation of hard controls in those processes where we have elevated risk. I guess in both cases, the important thing to observe as well is that our secondary safety controls, that is the flags and making sure people were clear of those areas where there was a heightened risk, ensured that we didn't have any injuries through either of those incidents. And that's a very important issue for us and a good learning as well. 
In terms of Grosvenor, the ignition of gas on the longwall face, it would appear, the gas was flushed through a wasteful. In looking at the other elements and learnings, we're still very much in an investigation process as is the department. But most importantly, our 5 colleagues that were injured are now making a good recovery. Some are already home. But again, we're making sure that we're working with the families and helping them on the rehabilitation path. I guess, most importantly, and again, the key point to stress for us as a business is that we have to continue to improve and get to 0. 
On health, our WeCare program was our central focus in 2020, obviously with COVID. I will talk to that a little bit. And on the environment, we've had one incident, which was a repeat spill due to heavy range in South Africa in one of the tailings areas in the Base Metals Refinery. And again, introducing some additional engineering work to make sure that we don't have that exposure on a go-forward basis. 
So for us, the other 2 milestones that were important for us in 2020, on the environmental side, was the confirmation that we believe we can get to carbon neutrality by 2040 and that we would have at least 8 operations carbon neutral by 2030. I think that -- I think the thing that characterizes us differently is we are willing and will show you when we meet a pathway to carbon neutrality that's quite unique and different in the industry. And our 2040 date is certainly leading edge in terms of industry and making sure we get there in good time. 
That obviously -- and that move obviously coincides with our announcement on the demerger or our intention of a potential demerger of thermal coal operations in South Africa in the 2- to 3-year time frame. All very important milestones for us and our business and very much a statement about where the portfolio is going over the next few years. 
And going to the next slide, which is Slide 5 in your deck. Again, the numbers show how challenging and volatile times have been and we didn't help ourselves with those self-inflicted interruptions. But we've still maintained our focus on improving the business and making sure that we're putting our best foot forward wherever we can. 
While production was down 11%, I think it's more -- it's very important to understand that at the same time -- and with the big lockdowns, we lost 20% of our working hours during the course of the first half. As I said, we were down -- or we lost almost 50% of our workforce at the end of -- towards the end of March and into April. And on a full half basis, we lost about 20% of the time available to us in terms of our production teams. So the 11% production drop is credible in that context. 
Our operating costs, 4% lower than we were last year, has obviously had some help from foreign exchange. But again, at the operating level, we were still down 3% or 4% against where we were last year on an apples for apples basis. And so I think the progress we've made in continuing to improve our productivity has been very solid. And again, when I adjust for hours worked, our productivities were actually up 7%. So the underlying performance was strong, but obviously, big impact from lockdowns and the other measures we've had to take as a consequence of COVID. 
Stephen will take you through the balance sheet details a little further. So I won't dwell any longer on the actual operating numbers other than to make one point. We've delivered a dividend consistent with our policy, the 40% payout ratio, and that's important. And so from our perspective, we've maintained faith with our shareholders as we said we would. 
In terms of defining and describing our response to COVID, we'll talk about the response in 3 parts. Firstly, and through our WeCare program, we focused on prevention, that is keeping people safe and hoping that we can keep them away from exposure in terms of the virus. And that includes our work in the community. Secondly, in having an exposure, how do we respond? How do we sort the business and make sure we configure the business to continue operations. And then obviously, while we're doing all of that work with the communities and doing all of that work with governments, we've also got one eye trained very firmly on how we recover the business over time. And as I said, getting to 90% production by the end of June was very important to us. And I'm still sure that it will be a bit of a bumpy ride through the second half. 
But the most important thing is we've established a relationship with our communities. We've established trust. We've established a relationship with governments. We're providing advice and support on how they can deal with issues. We've actually designed new ways of operating, social distancing. We have our own app, Engage, which every 1 of our employees has that helps them understand our expectations and also provides a platform to communicate how we can improve things. And so the tailoring of the business has been something quite unique. And from our perspective, there were many positives that come out of the learnings that we've been through in terms of the business. 
And so the final point I'd make in terms of our response and how we've connected with our communities, this is not new to us. It's in our DNA. It's consistent with our purpose, which is around reimagine mining to improve people's lives. And again, the learnings that we've had are significant and will certainly improve both our approach in connection with our communities and, on a longer-term basis, in terms of the way we see efficiencies and how we can work differently and more efficiently across the business. 
I'm now on Slide 7. Just to reinforce how far we've come in the last few years. In 2012 and with materially higher commodity prices, our industrial margin was sitting around 30%. In 2019, and with -- it was almost 10% lower prices, we actually delivered margins of 42%. If I adjust for commodity price mix, we would have been at around 47% if we were back in 2012. So the improvements have been significant, and they've been sustained in the business. Our operating costs are [ 30% ] lower. That's in nominal terms. And our productivities are double where they were back in 2012. 
For us, the first half was also impacted by the delay in sales. Obviously, not much going on in the diamond sector or the luxury goods sector. In PGMs, obviously the converter incident had an impact on what we get out, but we'll see both of those improve in the second half. And so we expect our sales to start picking up and certainly, the cash flow position to change to the upside as we continue to improve our sales and pull stock out of working capital. 
More specifically and talking about diamond, the diamond market and why we believe it's structurally attractive. As you know, the diamond market has been growing in the last 10 years. And 2009 was the last recession or the last major recession. And we've seen consistent sales growth over that period. It's also important to note that we've seen consistent supply growth through that period. And that's something that's changing across the industry. 
Today, we've seen continuing improvement -- or we've seen a very tough start to the year, but we've seen continuing efficiency improvements in the business. But with the market where it is, we've actually pulled back our production more than 20%. And we've seen the other major player in the market pull its production back as well. And we also expect supply to fall away as smaller operators have found it more difficult to operate in these times. And with companies closing operation through resource depletion -- because you can't forget we haven't seen a major new discovery in diamonds for the last 10 years, we think structurally, the prognosis is very good. 
Our research tells us that the market is strong. And in our case, when you look at China, which was first impacted by COVID, we saw virtually no sales in the first quarter. Yet in March and June of this year, we've seen sales actually exceed last year's May and June figures. And the sense we have from interacting with people on the ground is very positive. 
Now we certainly don't expect Europe and the U.S. to recover as quickly. For us, a key selling part of the year is in the period from Thanksgiving through to the new -- or through to Christmas and the New Year in the U.S. We would expect to see things pick up materially by then. But again, we're not ones to try and forecast in a month. Our stock position will be such that we can respond quickly to a change in the market. And certainly, we'd expect to start to see stocks running down in the fourth quarter. But again, I'll let Stephen talk to that in terms of where we are. But given that we've pulled production back, and we see a continuing depletion in the midstream, because there are sales actually occurring, we think the business will be in a good position by year-end and certainly be ready for a much stronger 2021. 
Finally, again, with supplies falling away somewhere between 15% and 20% over the next 2 or 3 years, we expect our rare product to become much rarer. And so for us, structurally, we think diamonds is in a good place. 
On a broader scale and across the business -- and I'm now on Slide 9. Our copper business has done extremely well in the first half. Great performances from Collahuasi. Los Bronces is actually starting to get some rains. So that's good news. Our costs have dropped from $1.35 to $1.07 a pound. And yes, foreign exchanges has played a part, but our operating costs have been really improving at the operating level on an apples-for-apples basis. And so thrilled with what's happening. 
And remember, with Quellaveco and other incremental improvements, we expect to grow our business 50%. With Quellaveco making a Q1 cost contribution to the operations, you're going to see us grow the business and reduce our operating costs. Really thrilled with the work the guys have done. 
In PGMs, again, we've positioned strongly for the recovery. We've got the second or the standby converter operating. We will have the refurbished converter operating in Q4. And so again, that will continue the recovery. And again, with Mogalakwena, almost at full rate, Amandelbult at about 70% and Natascha focusing very strongly on the stability and the performance of the processing operations, I think we're in good shape. 
We are still seeing infections around the communities in and around our platinum operations. But with recovery of people that had been infected actually outnumbering new infections, we're actually seeing a drift -- positive drift back into the operations with people. So again, we think we're dealing and managing the issues well, and we're seeing people return to work. 
Across Bulks, again, another solid response, particularly pleasing with the Minas-Rio. Our ramp-up through the half, I think we were about 21% of where we were last year. We actually touched nominal capacity in March. So great performance at Minas-Rio. 
The nickel operations also in Brazil have done exceptionally well. Seamus and the guys obviously had the Grosvenor incident in Australia, but now Moranbah and the other operations are doing well. Kumba, great recovery after the lock down in March. Timber and the team have done a great job and you will see in those results as they reported yesterday. 
I'd also like to make a special comment and commend our Bulks team or, in particular, the marketing team in Bulks and across the board. They've done a great job in getting our product to market. And in particular, when we had the issue with the converter, we were able to satisfy all of our customer needs in the PGM space. And I think that was a remarkable piece of work. And that is also why people probably haven't got our earnings forecast absolutely right because the marketing team have made a great contribution. 
So for the second half, we believe the operations are heading into more stable and capable territory. And certainly, we think the second half should be a much better half for us. 
And with that, I'll hand across to Stephen. Stephen, you can see? You're on."

And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on h",1374,"Great. Thanks, Mark. And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on how we expect the balance sheet to respond from here. 
While I'm on the balance sheet, really pleased to see the lifting of the South African exchange control restrictions that was also announced back in February. We've managed costs tightly through the period, but sustainably, it's helped underpin our earnings. We've been able to exercise a degree of flexibility in CapEx to help protect our cash flows where needed. But importantly, we've done all of this in a really sustainable way, fully funding our stay-in-business capital and not compromising our growth projects. 
So looking at the numbers, it was always going to be a volatile period, but they reflect all of the hard work across the whole Anglo American team. An EBITDA of $3.4 billion, despite an 11% impact on production. And that's really benefited from the transformation process that we've been through for the last 7 years. It's really given us a solid operational base. 
EPS at $0.72 a share. And off the back of that, a $0.28 dividend based on our 40% payout policy. Unit costs, down 4%, with some help from FX. But remember, that is off a lower production volume. So some really good performance at an important time for us. CapEx $1.8 billion. And I'll talk to cash flow and working capital a little bit later. 
So moving to Slide 12. Looking at the breakdown of the $3.4 billion across the business unit. As you would expect, very limited earnings from diamonds, given the extent of the lockdown right across the whole diamond value chain. And just to remind you, we did give flexibility to our customers, particularly through Q2. 
Really good performance from copper, as Mark touched on, in an environment where we had slightly softer prices. Some challenges at Los Bronces with water. But production back on track and traveling very strongly with C1 cash cost of $1.07 a pound. 
PGM is obviously heavily affected by the converter plant outage but strong earnings, when you consider this really closer to 1 quarter sale rather than 2. And again, full complements to the marketing team who managed to juggle those production challenges, sourcing material in a tight market and meeting our customers' demand with all of the uncertainty that they were also going through. 
Bulks benefiting from the great work at Minas-Rio, good recovery at Kumba post the lockdowns and definitely helped by the stronger iron ore price. In the Bulks, partly offset by lower prices of met coal and the operational issues that Mark has spoken to. 
So if we turn to Slide 13 and the drivers of EBITDA. Firstly, price. Some ups and downs across met coal, thermal coal and copper that I've spoken to. But broadly offset by the benefit that we see in the weaker producer currencies. The impact of COVID, approximately USD 1.1 billion, largely from consumer demand affecting diamonds and the South African lockdowns that we had through that March-April period at Kumba, PGMs and thermal coal. 
We took a considered and staged approach at each site. We felt it was appropriate, also considering the community and country aspects, always with health and safety as our #1 priority. 
The outage of ACP at PGMs reduced EBITDA by $0.6 billion and together with $0.4 billion in relation to the disruptions at met coal. So putting all of those things aside, the rest of the business actually performed quite well, led by copper and Minas-Rio, in particular. Hence, the $0.4 billion improvement driven by those 2 sites. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the balance sheet. We -- as I said, we entered the start of the period, a very, very strong position. Net debt to EBITDA of 0.5x at the start of the period. And there was 2 primary factors across the 6 months that saw net debt increase. So firstly, the allocation of capital towards growth, $0.4 billion at Quellaveco and $0.7 billion with the acquisition of a crop nutrients business as we acquired Sirius. Secondly, we had a $1.4 billion buildup of working capital across the half. Diamonds at $0.5 billion and PGMs also at $0.5 billion. 
We had some shorter-term weather impacts just towards the end of June at copper in Kumba. So we do expect working capital should run down through the second half. So Diamond is probably more over a 6 to 12 month period, depending on markets. PGM is fairly substantially over the next 6 to 9 months. And the copper and Kumba miner bill should clear in Q3. 
Also, helpfully, from a balance sheet perspective, the lifting of South African exchange controls, and that's now in the process of being implemented and developed. A really pleasing development. As I've said previously, the currency controls that used to exist didn't have a major practical or a significant impact on us. But we do welcome the simplicity in capital structure and the move towards a more typical OECD regime. I think it also sends a really strong positive message about the country's desire to promote investment and growth. 
So as a result, net debt of $7.6 billion, that's around 1.1x EBITDA, well within our guided range. Now obviously, as we look forward, all subject to the normal caveats, particularly around prices, exchange rates and any impact from COVID, but we would generally expect that number to trend downwards from here towards year-end.
Turning to CapEx on Slide 15. We're staying with our revised guidance, down by $1 billion to $4 billion, to $4.5 billion. And that does include the $300 million of year 1 spend at the Woodsmith project following the Sirius acquisition. 
The decrease in capital driven from a number of factors: weaker local exchange rates; some flexibility in the timing of our critical projects; and obviously, staying focused on our staying business capital spend. That reduction does include $300 million reduction in Quellaveco, and Mark will touch on that a little bit later. But importantly, because of the strength of the balance sheet, we've been able to make every decision for every asset for the right health and safety reason and for the right long-term economic outcome. At the same time, our brownfield projects, the diamond vessel in Namibia and Aquila in met coal remain on track and on budget. And you would have seen our recent announcement of a life extension project at Kumba at the Kolomela mine site. 
So clearly, on Slide 16, we remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation. And so to the scorecard for the half. Over the last 6 months, we maintained our base dividend, $600 million for the final dividend from 2019. And we allocated capital to some discretionary options. So growth capital in total, $0.8 billion for Sirius acquisition and $6 billion on our other growth projects. And we also saw the finalization of the additional shareholder return. So $200 million from the share buyback program. 
So stepping back on Slide 17. Yes, a volatile few months, but we're well placed, and it still remains about balance. We reinstated the dividend in '17, and since then, we have returned $5 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our balance sheet target of no more than 1.5x net debt to EBITDA through the cycle. All of that underpins our growth profile. Our P101 and technology development and the marketing focus on margins allows us to invest sensibly across the business. And that, in turn, will drive our growth in production, EBITDA and cash flow. 
Quellaveco project in Peru, the brownfields project, should deliver a combined 20% to 25% production growth by 2023. In copper equivalent terms, that's really market leading. We believe our long-term EBITDA margins from the mining business can reach that 45% level based on long-term consensus commodity prices. So a real commitment to get the balance right. In terms of balance sheet, returns to shareholders, importantly, relationships with stakeholders and the discretionary allocation of surplus cash flows. 
Mark, back to you."
409115,677161141,2092501,"Anglo American plc, H1 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for",1951,"Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for a long time. And certainly, the work that we've done is starting to be recognized in terms of some of the new industries that are coming out. And our top rating in the FTSE in terms of what we're doing on the ground has been recognized. So from our point of view, all of those things matter. 
Consistent with that approach, and I'm on Slide 19, our work on the portfolio starts obviously around Quellaveco in Peru. Now prior to the onset of COVID-19 in mid-March, we were tracking somewhere between 3 and 4 months ahead of the program. The guys have been doing a fantastic job. When the national quarantine was imposed, the majority of the project's 10,000 strong workforce were demobilized in line with the government's request and asked to head home. So we've helped people get back to home. Construction work, as a consequence, was significantly slowed. And whilst we maintained some critical -- works on critical items, we were substantially stopped across the board. 
With quarantine extended, we then decided to extend the lockdown for 3 months to give a chance for the country to get on top of COVID and, at the same time, so that we could minimize our outgoing cash expenditures with the view that we would then remobilize when we could put in place the workforce and deliver on full productivity. We thought that was the most effective way that we could contribute to the health and safety issues as well as make sure the project, when we hit the button, was able to run as hard as we could. 
So in taking that strategy, we're now on a restart, and it's a staged restart. We've estimated the cost of demobilization, remobilization and the cost of the structural changes we've made across the organization and how we've rescheduled to make sure we reduce the peak of workforce through the process. And in doing that, we've adjusted the financial estimate for the project to between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion. Now that leaves us with some contingency on the expectation but it still will be a bit of a bumpy ride over the next few months, as we see secondary infections, those sorts of things. But we think we've catered to those properly. 
And at the same time, we still think it's quite reasonable, and our forecast of delivering in 2022 remains on track. In fact, we're on track to the base schedule although we've had to give back, obviously, the big gains we made prior to March. But again, a lot of work is going on to continue to improve that work. 
The last 3 months, we've also been focused on improving the way we bring the operation up through commissioning. And so we haven't completed that work, but we've got some positives there. So we believe we can offset any cost issues and pull back some of that improved value through the way we operate through commissioning.
So I'm pretty pleased with the work the guys have done, and I think we're in really good shape.
In terms of crop nutrients, the U.K., despite a really tough period in lockdown, we were able to get back to work relatively quickly, implemented our social distancing rules. And where we've been somewhere like 30% or 40% above on productivity in the underground operation by changing and reconfiguring. We're not quite at that level above our plan, but we are on track to deliver the planned works for the year. That is the $300 million. So Chris and the guys have done a fantastic job. And as we look at the business and we look at the market potential, we're happier today than we were on the day we bought the asset on the basis of what we've seen. 
The guys have done a great job. Yes, there'll be some technical adjustments but they're at the margin. We think, generally, the team has got the configuration right. And from our point of view, the market and the interest we've had in the market for the product has really been positive, particularly when you think about the new world in terms of fertilizers and what we'll have to see in agriculture in terms of smart use of fertilizers. We think the products will be producing are certainly made-to-order for that new world. So very happy with where we are on Woodsmith. 
In terms of the transition from thermal coal, I think it's important to remember that as we transition out of thermal coal, we're building crop nutrients. And the crop nutrients business probably has got double the potential contribution it can make to the business. So we think that's a pretty good swap. In thermal coal, we've already reduced our footprint by 55%, back in '15, '16 when we sold assets that we didn't think could make a material contribution in the longer term. So we're well on the way. Today, it represents 5% of the EBITDA across the business and probably reducing over time, given the price forecast. We expect to be out of the business within 2 to 3 years. And from our point of view, that's a good place to be. 
But at the same time, we've got to acknowledge that they are and remain low-cost competitive assets, albeit with a relatively shorter mine life than the balance of our assets across the portfolio. But a good pack of assets. Likely a demerger within the next couple of years. We think that's the right decision for Anglo American. 
In terms of our broader portfolio and its positioning in the world that we're looking at in terms of the future, we're certainly positioned to contribute to an environmental-led new materials demand. We've seen the early evolution of electric vehicles and some of the challenges of energy storage. Now we're seeing widespread investment plans in hydrogen, first in China and demand in the automotive sector. We're seeing, obviously, buses in Britain using hydrogen. And now in Europe, we're seeing a much broader application and pull for hydrogen products. 
We've been central to the promotion of hydrogen as the new fuel source. We're a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. And certainly from our point of view, and our involvement in PGMs, gives us a vested interest in making sure that we help support growth in the industry. 
For us, you'll be aware that we're looking at introducing a solar array in South Africa to generate -- or use renewables to generate primary energy, but we'll oversell -- oversize those units and generate hydrogen so we can start converting the major truck fleets to hydrogen consumption as well. 
So from our perspective, it's a great place to be. And most importantly, over the same period and with a greater use of renewables, we also improve our cost structures by reducing energy consumption by 30% by 2030, which is also part of -- and one of the most important drivers of our cost-reduction strategy as well. So one plus one gets three, in terms of what we think hydrogen and other new developments will contribute in terms of our world. 
On Slide 23, you'll see our conversation around having an active route to a greener world and from our point of view, that's where we're going as a business. This approach fits with our commitment towards the environment and minimizing our direct impact and footprint in terms of the communities around us. 
We've committed to making the business carbon neutral by 2040 earlier than most, and that by 2030, we'll have at least 8 operations that will be carbon neutral. Again, it will be a combination of solar, wind and other renewable sources connected to hydrogen and also battery power so that we create closed-loop systems. And the pathway is very clear. The detailed design is still in the works, but we're also starting to move on the pilots that we're looking at developing to demonstrate those pathways. And the platinum business will be 1 of the first places that we develop. And in fact, we'll have our first off-highway truck on hydrogen during the course of this year.
Our new technology and innovation work is also central to this footprint. That 30% energy reduction includes implementation of bulk sorting, coarse particle flotation, bulks orders. We've got in 3 operations already through copper, PGMs and nickel. We've also got coarse particle flotation units being built in the copper business in Chile as we speak. And again, as we go further down line, looking at reducing our water consumption by 50%. And so really changing the nature of the operations, the footprint for the operations, and we hope, creating a model for the industry that will drive us all towards a much greener future and a much more significant contribution to a green future for the planet.
On Slide 24, we talk to the numbers in a very simple way. We're building and evolving a high-quality mix of assets that are suited to future demand and we expect to see improving margins as a consequence of those switch. So a consumer world, an electrified world, a greener world. And from our point of view, our cleaner, greener world products will make up 65% of our portfolio over the next few years. And certainly, from our point of view, even with our contribution in Bulks, we'll have high quality, highly efficient iron ore and met coal, which will make, again, another efficiency and cleaner contribution to the making of steel over the longer term.
On Page 25, we talk to delivery. Like all journeys to a much better place, the road is always not a smooth -- or is not as always smooth as you'd like, but there is no doubt in our progress and our continuing commitment to outpace our competitors in growth and continuing business improvement. As we have along the journey, we will keep learning and getting better. 
And we continue to measure success in sustainability through 3 primary lenses: first, effectiveness. Over the long term, we believe those companies that can generate better than 10% free cash flow will provide the ability to pay dividends and grow their business. And I'm not talking about the next 2 or 3 years, we're talking about the next 10 to 20 years. That's the business we're building. And as we broaden the contribution across our portfolio, you've got a portfolio set for long-term performance. Measuring the efficiency in how we generate those cash returns is just as critical for shareholders. And so our return on capital employed targets make sure that we keep our eye on capital discipline and that we don't throw money at simply generating cash and at the same time, destroying value. 
And being sustainable is absolutely key. So we have our 7 performance pillars: safety; environment; social performance; talent pool, making sure we've got the right people; production and resource base, and the life of assets we have in the portfolio; unit cost position, we continue to improve against our competitors; and ultimately, it's about having a conservative balance sheet that allows us to do the right things and continue to make sensible investments for the long term. 
And so with that, as a differentiated company in terms of assets, capabilities and the ability to deliver long-term returns, that's Anglo American, I'm very happy to take questions."

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work.

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work. So when you get those numbers, they balance out pretty well. 
On the carbon neutrality approach, I think, firstly, a comment on pathways. You'll see in Brazil, where we've signed long-term contracts with renewable energy suppliers, doing similar work in Chile. We've got lots of sun in Chile. We've got lots of sun in South Africa and in Queensland. So we want to use solar energy as much as we can. The idea of then oversizing, converting to hydrogen, creating closed loops with battery technologies as well, is pretty well been thought through. And you've got to remember, we're also looking at dropping our energy consumption through the efficiency work that we're doing at a technical level. So I think there's no doubt that we've got a complete solution pretty well thought through, and I think that's what puts us ahead, Liam. 
In terms of the 2040 target, again, we think we're on a good track to get there. We haven't relied on offsets to actually get to those numbers because of all of the work we're doing on the front end. I mean we've been putting the right people on the ground, working all of these solutions out to come up with the position we've taken. Certainly, that leaves us with the ability to look at offsets, if needed. But we really want to drive the business to make a better contribution. In my view, offsets are sort of cheating a little bit in that you're using someone else's credits to cover your own ability or inability to get to 0. So the focus for Anglo American is to get there under our own steam, if you pardon the pun. But at the same time, if we need to do a little bit on the offset side, we'll obviously keep that option open. 
And don't forget with crop nutrients, the idea of improving agricultural production means the world is going to have to use less land for agriculture to actually hit its carbon neutral targets. And so from our point of view, crop nutrients is a significant contributor to what difference we can make and given we've got such a small carbon footprint. So we've thought it through pretty well to get to those numbers."

The offset is a third option, but it hasn't played a major role in how we see ourselves getting to the end result."

So there was a bit of a view coming from investors that Anglo was getting quite confident and quite confident operationally. And I think some people even used the word swagger. And more recently, unfortunately, we've had some fairly serious operational incidents at both Amplat and in met coal. And today, I have the same investors asking me has something gone wrong in Anglo?

And specifically, I'm interested to know how you might be adjusting your operating model or at least the implementation of the operating model to address these incidents?"

In our view -- we're about 50% of the way through the implementation of the detail in the operating model. Where we start is what we call work management, which is about how we get work done, how we plan work and making sure we're delivering as per plan. And that's been the driver between safety improvement, the 90-odd percent, the environmental improvement, the 90%, the health improvement, 90%. And that work has gone well. We call that work management. 
In terms of operating strategy and the detailed technical design work, there's been a lot of good work there, but we're probably still only 50% of the way up to where we want to be. And that includes the change in the control systems we've got. For example, in platinum. We've still got a lot of stuff that's done manually. So there's a lot more automation required. 
And for example, Natascha has introduced 8 new both physical controls and procedural controls in the converter to make sure we don't have the same incident. So we're still working through. We're still learning. We're still a work-in-progress in many ways. To be specific, at Moranbah on the longwall, the area that we started the wall had a little bit different geology, but we applied a standard design. What we've done now is said, look, any of those designs -- and this goes right across the board or any of the major cutback designs, actually have to be signed off 1 level above. Because where you've got a change in circumstance, you really do make sure you've got all the issues covered. So I think that's an important change. And the new design configuration worked extremely well. We got away 3 weeks earlier and the operation has been going well. 
Now we've been implementing digitalization technologies in the management of the longwall, and that's improved our productivity to more than doubled. But there's still more work to be done. The Grosvenor issue in -- call it, a bit of a different issue. And I know a lot of technical people won't understand the issue. We don't think it was an operating issue in terms of the way we would handle things on a day-to-day basis. What appears as though we've had a major fall in the waste area, which all operations have, where you do have some accumulation of gas, where everybody has it. And it's actually flushed, that gas onto the longwall face. 
The question is what may have ignited the gas? And that's where the investigation work now is going on. And we'll find that solution. And I think, ultimately, that will require changes across the industry in the way some of these technologies work. But again, I'm going to let the investigation finish its work. But I think there'll be some changes in the industry. 
In terms of the ACP, again, there were some procedural issues and there were some control issues. I think Natascha is right on that. And to those that I've been talking to in the last few months, my -- I've explained the selection of Natascha in terms of her background in making sure we improve the operation, stability and consistency out of platinum. And even though we've had massive change in the portfolio, our consistency hasn't been as good as it could be. And that's where the focus is. So I'd like to say that the 90% improvement that we've seen across all the dimensions indicates that we've gone somewhere very different to where we are. But we've still got a way to go. We're still not as good as we would like to be, and we're still not at 0 incident. 
So we'll learn, we'll apply the lessons, and we'll keep getting better as we should. Good question."

Mark, I'll deal with the first one, and I'll make some opening comments on the second and then maybe throw it to you. 
So in terms of working capital, if you look at the sort of 3 primary areas, diamonds -- as Mark said, will clearly be market dependent. And it's hard to pick a month, but we're confident the market will come back and demand will flow through quite strongly when it does come back. So without picking the month, whether it happens in November, December or January, February, I'm not too bothered by it. It's really about market coming back, and I know the team are looking at how they can sell diamonds in a different way given the circumstances. So they're working hard on that one. 
On PGMs, given that we're now back up and running at the ACP and the materials flowing out, I'd expect that to come back quite strongly over the next 6 to 9 months. And so you should see -- it may not be all of it, but a substantial portion of that $0.5 billion reverse between now and probably the end of Q1 in 2021.
And copper and Kumba really was just about swells or capacity at the port in Kumba's case. So I think that should close itself out back through Q3. So all things being equal, I'd love to think potentially, you're at least $0.5 billion, maybe a bit extra flushing out of that through the second half. But it is, with all the qualifications that you would expect in terms of prices of markets and further interruptions by COVID. But that's probably about the best guidance I can give you. It's more around timing than absolute amounts. 
In terms of -- just maybe your first comment on our cost guidance, I mean, clearly, some of the businesses have been impacted by the disruptions, and some of that's flowing through into cost structure. Met coal is probably a good example where that's flowing through quite directly into unit costs. And probably the currency hasn't helped in that case as the Aussie dollar strengthened against the U.S. 
In the other markets, yes, copper is probably the standout. Yes, we've seen quite a -- I don't know what the percentage would be, 20% movement in currencies through copper-producing regions. That's clearly helped. And just looking across the others, again, there's no real comment there, given the limited sales through Brazil. Yes, again, we've had some currency movement that's helped. It's probably more in the sort of 10% to 15% range. 
So where we've produced well, you've seen sustainable cost out. And yes, that's been helped by foreign currency. There's no denying that. But you also have seen price movements. And so on Slide 13, I think you can see that those 2 things have largely offset 1 another between currency CPI and price movements. And so there's a bit of give and take across each of those. So rather than just focusing on cost, as I often do, I'd also ask you to focus on the price movement as well. 
Mark, any comments from you on that?"

I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the as",459,"Yes. Look, again, another good question. I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the assets that we're operating, are on average doing 30% more in terms of production. And in terms of their actual performance, that group of assets is doing at least 20%. I think it's about 23%, 24% better on unit costs. So we're at another level of performance. And it's interesting our actual underlying performance is actually even better than that, but we're having a little less consistency because we're at a higher level of performance. 
Now people know there's a few of us in the business that are pretty forensic in the way we pull stuff apart and understand what's going wrong and what we need to do to get right. So we've obviously looked at the issues in coal and the ACP issue. But it's actually a much broader view. And we're looking at how we can improve the stability to take another 5% to 10% step on the operating cost side. And the two go hand-in-hand. 
So on the big improvements, we're continuing to make, we're giving about 60% back to inconsistency, and I'm talking about the last 12 months. So we're just working really hard with the teams to get the stability. And so on the basis of the first half, and Stephen stripped away COVID and other movements, we had about a $400 million improvement outside of platinum and met coal. There's about a 4 -- 3% to 4% underlying cost improvement in the business if we can get that stability across the business that we'll take into the new year. So that's what Tony is focusing on with the operating teams, is to get the stability. 
We're working at another level in terms of risks and automation. That work's ongoing with the digital work. So I'm hoping that we're taking 3% to 5% improvement that you're seeing some of it in the underlying performances into next year. But that's 1 we'll talk about at the end of the year once we've seen how far we've come along in terms of improving our stabilities. But the 1 thing I have to say, being in Anglo American is about constant improvement. And when we do have issues, we try and do everything we can to make sure we learn and we apply the lessons across the board. And we've stubbed our toe and we're in the process of making sure that we understand and apply those learnings. And again, we'll keep you posted on that progress over the next 6 months."

So I'll try and unpack them as quickly as I can and deal with each of them. 
Firstly, on the thermal coal transfer, certainly from South Africa, the response from the government has been very positive and constructive. So if we ultimately go down the demerger proposal, and that's the most likely route, we'll certainly, I think, do that in better than 2 years. Cerrejón, people know where we stand on Cerrejón. We will exit at some point. But we are also being very respectful of our 2 partners in terms of our processes. We maintain a dialogue. And at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, I think we'll be gone from there as well. Again, I don't want to be or can't be too hard on the timing of that. Because, again, we've got 2 other -- I was going to say, customers, 2 other competitors and 2 other colleagues that we have in that asset, we're making sure that we deal with that the right way. But again, we should be out of both in that time frame. Certainly, the South African change will be much quicker. 
In terms of met coal, look, the carbon issue is obviously a question. But I think most investors are a little more sophisticated than people give them credit for. They understand that steel is absolutely critical. And that you need met coal in the mix, and it will take time to make the changes. But there's no doubt that in terms of capital allocation, we keep an eye on when those changes and how those trends will change. We do for iron ore as well. Because we will see more recycling by 2035. We think steel will make -- steel recycling will make up 50% of the mix. We think iron ore starts to change shape by 2025. 
So with both iron ore and met coal, we'll keep an eye on capital allocation. We'll tend to operate and run to pull a bit more cash. And our new investments will go into those commodities or products that we think are longer term, the big game changers. And that's why we think we're very different to our competitors, we've got a much longer view. We've got a portfolio that's set up for the future. And certainly, we're making sure people are very clear that we're building this business for long-term performance. 
In terms of De Beers, being consistent on the different product side, in the last 10 years, De Beers have delivered around 10% sustainable free cash flow. So that's before it's growth CapEx. We're currently operating at about 27 million, 28 million carats. We can actually take that up to about 37 million, 38 million carats, if the market is strong. We expect supply to drop away, 15% to 20% in the next 2 or 3 years. You know about Argyle, and there are other changes in the market that are recurring. So structurally, we think the business is in good shape. We are, when you look at it, running the best diamond business in the world, and it has been for 90 years. So there's no reason for us to think differently about that. We think prices will likely be stronger on the basis of supply falling away. There hasn't been a major discovery for 10 years. 
But in terms of what Bruce is doing, the rest of the business has made significant improvement in our cost structures. De Beers has made improvements, but it hasn't come as far down that cost curve, but also, it has to think about the midstream, downstream and its marketing investment. So Bruce is thinking right across the value chain, looking at improving its cost and looking at how we continue to evolve the business for the long term. 
And I know 1 or 2 old timers from De Beers say that it's not like it used to be. Well, it can't be. We're not about shaping this business for the last 20 years, we're about shaping this business for the next 20 years. And so Bruce has worked that we'll talk about in the next little while because, obviously, we have to take all our employees through it, is about improving our costs. It's about making sure structurally the business is set for the long term, and it's about making sure that we're the key supplier getting the right price for a rare product that's becoming rarer. And certainly, we think it's positioned for the long term."

But if I just looked at the diesel -- current diesel costs, capital costs and operating costs, in looking at the solar array that we're looking at for Mogalakwena, oversizing, providing our primary power source to the plant, and then using excess capacity to generate hydrogen in a closed-loop system and then running our trucks, and it's -- the truck that we're looking at is a fuel cell battery hybrid -- it will be the first off-highway truck in the world designed by the Anglo American people, we've had some people supporting us, but our teams actually designed it. 
We believe the fuel cost on the total cost basis will be actually lower than what it costs us to run that system with energy off the SA grid and diesel fuel imported at global prices. We're not going to talk capital numbers yet. We will start actually explaining those numbers when we start presenting our sustainability strategies and when we talk to the detail on Mogalakwena. 
So we'll start unpacking the detail towards year-end and as we go forward. Stephen, I see your hand up. You'd like to say something?"

And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. A",350,"Yes. Thanks, Mark. And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. And I think you'll see more and more of that coming through as you get scale and volume in that sort of segment. 
A couple of other quick comments on that. Yes, a lot of the things that will help us get there are actually really good for our business anyway. So yes, some of the technology improvements, the coarse particle flotation, et cetera, the way we crush is good for the business and good from an ESG perspective. So they're actually a really integrated spend that helped drive you down that course. 
And obviously, some of these contracts and developments would be a question of, well, who spends the capital and how do you pay for that over time, not all of those things will necessarily be us spending the capital, but us getting the benefit of the outcome of that.
Maybe then just a couple of comments, and I'll throw it back to Mark on met coal. Again, capital allocation, we often do think in a 5-, 7-, 10-year world as we allocate capital. And so yes, met coal, I think, will still be a major part of particularly high-grade met coal. A major part of the steel production for 15-plus years. So we're still well inside that in terms of capital allocation. 
The Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, no, that won't be impacted by that. The rapid payback and returns on that, it's really an expansion in efficiencies through the wash plant that will give us the additional volume and returns. And Kapstevel south, as Mark mentioned, took full account of carbon pricing, community expectations, water, all of those sorts of things in our consideration and also has a fairly rapid payback through a 5- to 7-year period. So again, well inside, and again, a high-grade product like we currently produce on Kumba. 
Mark? Thank you."

Thanks, Stephen. That was a good summary. In -- to sort of capture that in a final comment, we believe that the capital implications are not significant on the basis that there will be a combination of what we invest in and Stephen's point around third-party supply, and there are people that are providing different types of structures and deals where they can have shared installations that will reduce our upfront capital cost and are very competitive from an operating cost perspective. And we're in a number of those conversations. And we've seen some of those already come through. 
And on the operating costs are actually then lower than what we've got as infrastructure in place. So it works both ways. And as Stephen said, Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, obviously, we'll get through the investigations and understand the key issues on Grosvenor. It will change, I suspect, a few things the way we operate. But the debottlenecking is a pretty straightforward project. It's got a rapid payback as has Kapstevel and other types of projects. So we'll continue to invest in the business, but you won't see big step outs in terms of substantial new projects. They're more likely to be in other parts of the business, if I could make it. It's a lean towards other parts of the business as opposed to a massive step out at this point in time. Because the prognosis is still good in met coal and iron ore, but prices will track down, we think, the opportunity to make better returns will shift into those areas over time."

But De Beers and obviously, the ship. But it's a competition for capital. We make judgments about what we think the markets will look like. So nothing less than you would expect. 
In terms of the PGM business, Mogalakwena has a few different types of options. We've got the ability to expand the open cut. And with the new exploration work, we've also got the ability to tee off with shallow declines into high-grade underground ore bodies that give us the ability to utilize our processing infrastructure more effectively. And those costs from those operations are very competitive, and in some cases, lower than the open cut operating costs. 
So as we've done our exploration, we've developed a whole new range of possibilities and options. And so where we should spend in the mine versus on the processing side is we're just trying to look at getting that balance right. We're also creating a lot of low-grade material out of Mogalakwena as well, which is very low-cost material, when you put it through the process. So we're getting those balances right to get the capital allocation right. 
So at the end of the year, we'll be talking about the preferred option for Mogalakwena. And it will likely be a bit more from the open cut future developments in underground, and there will be some processing configuration changes. And we'll try and utilize our facilities with more of our own feed because that will drive us further down the cost curve. So that's 1 example, Tyler. I could go through more, but I think you get the flavor of where we're going."

Look, the sight -- let me just talk in the broad. Firstly, from an operating perspective, and I use [ waning ] as an example, our shovel productivities have improved 40% to 50% and the team is on the trail and chasing some of our best-performing operations. So they'll continue to improve. And so we're taking those into account. The changes that are upper, the nicher productivities, our productivity is across all parts of the operation and looking at continuing to reduce our costs in those parts of the business. That's one. 
Our overheads, our administration has always got to look at tightening up and trimming those costs. We also want to invest more in diamonds and in our brands. Our brand's Forevermark have been growing much quicker than the rest of the industry, and it's very clear that you can get what we think is fair value for your products, if you've got the right brand and people understand what you're trying to do with the product. And so our investment strategy around marketing is very important. 
Given the last 2 or 3 years, and the positive growth we've seen in Forevermark, that's also a very important part of our strategy. So understanding right the way through to the consumers as well as the position with our customers. Now our Sightholder are our direct customers. They are part of the change. We are consulting them in the process. And so they will be part of the restructuring. 
Now to be fair to them, we would -- we think it's important to have those dialogues, but we are flagging. There's an important exercise that we've got to go through in making sure that they understand who will get what, how we'll position those conversations. And I'm not going to preempt what those conversations will look like. But again, the whole value chain has to keep evolving for the world that we have and how we're competing with other discretionary spend products. And so for us, it's a natural evolution. As I said earlier, it's not about the last 20 years, it's about what we see today and for the next 20 years. That's how we're creating De Beers or continuing to transform De Beers."

I'm here slaving away at work. Stephen is setting in his backyard next to the pool. So if we look at each other and we're juggling between the 2 of us, it's just making sure that we're coordinated. Hopefully, you're all used to the format by now. We're still developing and making sure we get it right. But the most important thing is that we are connected with you, give you a chance to ask questions as well. And from our point of view, make sure that we're accessible to our shareholders. 
We are open for business. 
So I'm on the first slide, which is the header. From our point of view, it's obviously been a very tough 6 months. COVID-19 is a new term we've all had to learn and adapt to. In our case, it obviously had -- it has obviously had a material impact on our operations and the business. But certainly, from our perspective, I think we finished the half strong. And we also believe that taking that improving performance into the second half will be the key to us delivering a much better full year result. 
In opening the presentation, I think it's also important to acknowledge all of our colleagues in Anglo American, acknowledge the communities with which we work, in which we operate and with which we work and the partnership we've had with so many members in the community and so many stakeholders across the board. Our WeCare program has become a cornerstone for our response to COVID, in which we focus on making sure that our people are looked after, that we're also playing our part in our local communities, even more so than we normally do, and I'll talk a little bit about that later. And from our point of view that we're making a real contribution.
At the same time, we've been working very hard to make sure that we protect the business, that we maintain business continuity, and we're rebuilding the operations after some pretty significant lockdowns in March and April. I guess the best way to show that will characterize that in numbers is in April. After the March lockdowns, we were producing at less than 60% of production capacity and by the end of June, we're at 90%. 
So the recovery continues. There's still got some -- we've still got some hard work to do. And I do expect that the second half may be a little bumpy, but certainly, we're in a very different place. And I think we've built a set of relationships with communities and governments, where they know and understand how we can help keep the economy going and at the same time, keep people safe. And I think that's the key to the future. And certainly, from our perspective, I think we've built that foundation and that trust with our communities and with our governments that does support us in going forward. 
So let's jump straight into the presentation. I'm going to go to Slide 3, which is the agenda, very simply put. We'll keep the order of play as usual. I'll talk about where we are today. With the world a more complex place, and I think it's important for you to know how we're dealing with the issues. Stephen will take you through the numbers and pull apart the detail, and then I will pick the ball back up and take you through how we see the forward look. And then we'll go to Q&A. 
So I'm now on Slide 4. As we should and always do, we open with safety, health and environment. At first glance, if you look at where we've come from over the last 7 years, we've been significantly improving our performance in the business. In safety, about a 70% improvement in terms of our injury frequency rates, but even more important, our fatalities have dropped 93.5%. In the last 12 months, we've lost one colleague. That's one too many, but we're making progress from where we started. Secondly, in terms of health, we've improved our position 95% in eliminating serious health hazards throughout the business. And on environment, we've reduced our incidents by 97%. 
But when you talk about those issues, it's not simply about numbers. We've had some serious incidents in the first half, and we've just been bloody lucky we didn't lose a colleague in those incidents. And so we've improved the underlying performance, we still haven't delivered 0 incidents, and that's something that we're focused on, and we'll continue to improve. As you're aware, on the Moranbah longwall face, we had a ground fall. We've since recovered. We understand the issue, where we've not had the right technical design inputting into changing geotechnical conditions. We've actually changed the organization design to make sure that we've got that response. 
And we've also checked across the business in any other areas where we may be deficient in terms of the level of technical input, and I think we've straightened that issue out. I guess the proof is in the pudding. We ended up getting the wall away about 3 weeks earlier than our forecast after the fall, and the operation has been going well since. And certainly, the digitization work that Tony and the team have been doing with Seamus has helped improve our performance, and we have to keep improving.
In terms of the converter incident in platinum, Natascha and the team have already implemented a range of both physical and operating process controls, 8 in track. And again, we'll continue on our pathway to automation and the high -- installation of hard controls in those processes where we have elevated risk. I guess in both cases, the important thing to observe as well is that our secondary safety controls, that is the flags and making sure people were clear of those areas where there was a heightened risk, ensured that we didn't have any injuries through either of those incidents. And that's a very important issue for us and a good learning as well. 
In terms of Grosvenor, the ignition of gas on the longwall face, it would appear, the gas was flushed through a wasteful. In looking at the other elements and learnings, we're still very much in an investigation process as is the department. But most importantly, our 5 colleagues that were injured are now making a good recovery. Some are already home. But again, we're making sure that we're working with the families and helping them on the rehabilitation path. I guess, most importantly, and again, the key point to stress for us as a business is that we have to continue to improve and get to 0. 
On health, our WeCare program was our central focus in 2020, obviously with COVID. I will talk to that a little bit. And on the environment, we've had one incident, which was a repeat spill due to heavy range in South Africa in one of the tailings areas in the Base Metals Refinery. And again, introducing some additional engineering work to make sure that we don't have that exposure on a go-forward basis. 
So for us, the other 2 milestones that were important for us in 2020, on the environmental side, was the confirmation that we believe we can get to carbon neutrality by 2040 and that we would have at least 8 operations carbon neutral by 2030. I think that -- I think the thing that characterizes us differently is we are willing and will show you when we meet a pathway to carbon neutrality that's quite unique and different in the industry. And our 2040 date is certainly leading edge in terms of industry and making sure we get there in good time. 
That obviously -- and that move obviously coincides with our announcement on the demerger or our intention of a potential demerger of thermal coal operations in South Africa in the 2- to 3-year time frame. All very important milestones for us and our business and very much a statement about where the portfolio is going over the next few years. 
And going to the next slide, which is Slide 5 in your deck. Again, the numbers show how challenging and volatile times have been and we didn't help ourselves with those self-inflicted interruptions. But we've still maintained our focus on improving the business and making sure that we're putting our best foot forward wherever we can. 
While production was down 11%, I think it's more -- it's very important to understand that at the same time -- and with the big lockdowns, we lost 20% of our working hours during the course of the first half. As I said, we were down -- or we lost almost 50% of our workforce at the end of -- towards the end of March and into April. And on a full half basis, we lost about 20% of the time available to us in terms of our production teams. So the 11% production drop is credible in that context. 
Our operating costs, 4% lower than we were last year, has obviously had some help from foreign exchange. But again, at the operating level, we were still down 3% or 4% against where we were last year on an apples for apples basis. And so I think the progress we've made in continuing to improve our productivity has been very solid. And again, when I adjust for hours worked, our productivities were actually up 7%. So the underlying performance was strong, but obviously, big impact from lockdowns and the other measures we've had to take as a consequence of COVID. 
Stephen will take you through the balance sheet details a little further. So I won't dwell any longer on the actual operating numbers other than to make one point. We've delivered a dividend consistent with our policy, the 40% payout ratio, and that's important. And so from our perspective, we've maintained faith with our shareholders as we said we would. 
In terms of defining and describing our response to COVID, we'll talk about the response in 3 parts. Firstly, and through our WeCare program, we focused on prevention, that is keeping people safe and hoping that we can keep them away from exposure in terms of the virus. And that includes our work in the community. Secondly, in having an exposure, how do we respond? How do we sort the business and make sure we configure the business to continue operations. And then obviously, while we're doing all of that work with the communities and doing all of that work with governments, we've also got one eye trained very firmly on how we recover the business over time. And as I said, getting to 90% production by the end of June was very important to us. And I'm still sure that it will be a bit of a bumpy ride through the second half. 
But the most important thing is we've established a relationship with our communities. We've established trust. We've established a relationship with governments. We're providing advice and support on how they can deal with issues. We've actually designed new ways of operating, social distancing. We have our own app, Engage, which every 1 of our employees has that helps them understand our expectations and also provides a platform to communicate how we can improve things. And so the tailoring of the business has been something quite unique. And from our perspective, there were many positives that come out of the learnings that we've been through in terms of the business. 
And so the final point I'd make in terms of our response and how we've connected with our communities, this is not new to us. It's in our DNA. It's consistent with our purpose, which is around reimagine mining to improve people's lives. And again, the learnings that we've had are significant and will certainly improve both our approach in connection with our communities and, on a longer-term basis, in terms of the way we see efficiencies and how we can work differently and more efficiently across the business. 
I'm now on Slide 7. Just to reinforce how far we've come in the last few years. In 2012 and with materially higher commodity prices, our industrial margin was sitting around 30%. In 2019, and with -- it was almost 10% lower prices, we actually delivered margins of 42%. If I adjust for commodity price mix, we would have been at around 47% if we were back in 2012. So the improvements have been significant, and they've been sustained in the business. Our operating costs are [ 30% ] lower. That's in nominal terms. And our productivities are double where they were back in 2012. 
For us, the first half was also impacted by the delay in sales. Obviously, not much going on in the diamond sector or the luxury goods sector. In PGMs, obviously the converter incident had an impact on what we get out, but we'll see both of those improve in the second half. And so we expect our sales to start picking up and certainly, the cash flow position to change to the upside as we continue to improve our sales and pull stock out of working capital. 
More specifically and talking about diamond, the diamond market and why we believe it's structurally attractive. As you know, the diamond market has been growing in the last 10 years. And 2009 was the last recession or the last major recession. And we've seen consistent sales growth over that period. It's also important to note that we've seen consistent supply growth through that period. And that's something that's changing across the industry. 
Today, we've seen continuing improvement -- or we've seen a very tough start to the year, but we've seen continuing efficiency improvements in the business. But with the market where it is, we've actually pulled back our production more than 20%. And we've seen the other major player in the market pull its production back as well. And we also expect supply to fall away as smaller operators have found it more difficult to operate in these times. And with companies closing operation through resource depletion -- because you can't forget we haven't seen a major new discovery in diamonds for the last 10 years, we think structurally, the prognosis is very good. 
Our research tells us that the market is strong. And in our case, when you look at China, which was first impacted by COVID, we saw virtually no sales in the first quarter. Yet in March and June of this year, we've seen sales actually exceed last year's May and June figures. And the sense we have from interacting with people on the ground is very positive. 
Now we certainly don't expect Europe and the U.S. to recover as quickly. For us, a key selling part of the year is in the period from Thanksgiving through to the new -- or through to Christmas and the New Year in the U.S. We would expect to see things pick up materially by then. But again, we're not ones to try and forecast in a month. Our stock position will be such that we can respond quickly to a change in the market. And certainly, we'd expect to start to see stocks running down in the fourth quarter. But again, I'll let Stephen talk to that in terms of where we are. But given that we've pulled production back, and we see a continuing depletion in the midstream, because there are sales actually occurring, we think the business will be in a good position by year-end and certainly be ready for a much stronger 2021. 
Finally, again, with supplies falling away somewhere between 15% and 20% over the next 2 or 3 years, we expect our rare product to become much rarer. And so for us, structurally, we think diamonds is in a good place. 
On a broader scale and across the business -- and I'm now on Slide 9. Our copper business has done extremely well in the first half. Great performances from Collahuasi. Los Bronces is actually starting to get some rains. So that's good news. Our costs have dropped from $1.35 to $1.07 a pound. And yes, foreign exchanges has played a part, but our operating costs have been really improving at the operating level on an apples-for-apples basis. And so thrilled with what's happening. 
And remember, with Quellaveco and other incremental improvements, we expect to grow our business 50%. With Quellaveco making a Q1 cost contribution to the operations, you're going to see us grow the business and reduce our operating costs. Really thrilled with the work the guys have done. 
In PGMs, again, we've positioned strongly for the recovery. We've got the second or the standby converter operating. We will have the refurbished converter operating in Q4. And so again, that will continue the recovery. And again, with Mogalakwena, almost at full rate, Amandelbult at about 70% and Natascha focusing very strongly on the stability and the performance of the processing operations, I think we're in good shape. 
We are still seeing infections around the communities in and around our platinum operations. But with recovery of people that had been infected actually outnumbering new infections, we're actually seeing a drift -- positive drift back into the operations with people. So again, we think we're dealing and managing the issues well, and we're seeing people return to work. 
Across Bulks, again, another solid response, particularly pleasing with the Minas-Rio. Our ramp-up through the half, I think we were about 21% of where we were last year. We actually touched nominal capacity in March. So great performance at Minas-Rio. 
The nickel operations also in Brazil have done exceptionally well. Seamus and the guys obviously had the Grosvenor incident in Australia, but now Moranbah and the other operations are doing well. Kumba, great recovery after the lock down in March. Timber and the team have done a great job and you will see in those results as they reported yesterday. 
I'd also like to make a special comment and commend our Bulks team or, in particular, the marketing team in Bulks and across the board. They've done a great job in getting our product to market. And in particular, when we had the issue with the converter, we were able to satisfy all of our customer needs in the PGM space. And I think that was a remarkable piece of work. And that is also why people probably haven't got our earnings forecast absolutely right because the marketing team have made a great contribution. 
So for the second half, we believe the operations are heading into more stable and capable territory. And certainly, we think the second half should be a much better half for us. 
And with that, I'll hand across to Stephen. Stephen, you can see? You're on."

And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on h",1374,"Great. Thanks, Mark. And thanks, Mark, and good morning. As Mark said, the business has been robust through a volatile few months. The strength of the balance sheet as we entered the period has served us really well, and I'll touch a little bit later on how we expect the balance sheet to respond from here. 
While I'm on the balance sheet, really pleased to see the lifting of the South African exchange control restrictions that was also announced back in February. We've managed costs tightly through the period, but sustainably, it's helped underpin our earnings. We've been able to exercise a degree of flexibility in CapEx to help protect our cash flows where needed. But importantly, we've done all of this in a really sustainable way, fully funding our stay-in-business capital and not compromising our growth projects. 
So looking at the numbers, it was always going to be a volatile period, but they reflect all of the hard work across the whole Anglo American team. An EBITDA of $3.4 billion, despite an 11% impact on production. And that's really benefited from the transformation process that we've been through for the last 7 years. It's really given us a solid operational base. 
EPS at $0.72 a share. And off the back of that, a $0.28 dividend based on our 40% payout policy. Unit costs, down 4%, with some help from FX. But remember, that is off a lower production volume. So some really good performance at an important time for us. CapEx $1.8 billion. And I'll talk to cash flow and working capital a little bit later. 
So moving to Slide 12. Looking at the breakdown of the $3.4 billion across the business unit. As you would expect, very limited earnings from diamonds, given the extent of the lockdown right across the whole diamond value chain. And just to remind you, we did give flexibility to our customers, particularly through Q2. 
Really good performance from copper, as Mark touched on, in an environment where we had slightly softer prices. Some challenges at Los Bronces with water. But production back on track and traveling very strongly with C1 cash cost of $1.07 a pound. 
PGM is obviously heavily affected by the converter plant outage but strong earnings, when you consider this really closer to 1 quarter sale rather than 2. And again, full complements to the marketing team who managed to juggle those production challenges, sourcing material in a tight market and meeting our customers' demand with all of the uncertainty that they were also going through. 
Bulks benefiting from the great work at Minas-Rio, good recovery at Kumba post the lockdowns and definitely helped by the stronger iron ore price. In the Bulks, partly offset by lower prices of met coal and the operational issues that Mark has spoken to. 
So if we turn to Slide 13 and the drivers of EBITDA. Firstly, price. Some ups and downs across met coal, thermal coal and copper that I've spoken to. But broadly offset by the benefit that we see in the weaker producer currencies. The impact of COVID, approximately USD 1.1 billion, largely from consumer demand affecting diamonds and the South African lockdowns that we had through that March-April period at Kumba, PGMs and thermal coal. 
We took a considered and staged approach at each site. We felt it was appropriate, also considering the community and country aspects, always with health and safety as our #1 priority. 
The outage of ACP at PGMs reduced EBITDA by $0.6 billion and together with $0.4 billion in relation to the disruptions at met coal. So putting all of those things aside, the rest of the business actually performed quite well, led by copper and Minas-Rio, in particular. Hence, the $0.4 billion improvement driven by those 2 sites. 
Turning to Slide 14 on the balance sheet. We -- as I said, we entered the start of the period, a very, very strong position. Net debt to EBITDA of 0.5x at the start of the period. And there was 2 primary factors across the 6 months that saw net debt increase. So firstly, the allocation of capital towards growth, $0.4 billion at Quellaveco and $0.7 billion with the acquisition of a crop nutrients business as we acquired Sirius. Secondly, we had a $1.4 billion buildup of working capital across the half. Diamonds at $0.5 billion and PGMs also at $0.5 billion. 
We had some shorter-term weather impacts just towards the end of June at copper in Kumba. So we do expect working capital should run down through the second half. So Diamond is probably more over a 6 to 12 month period, depending on markets. PGM is fairly substantially over the next 6 to 9 months. And the copper and Kumba miner bill should clear in Q3. 
Also, helpfully, from a balance sheet perspective, the lifting of South African exchange controls, and that's now in the process of being implemented and developed. A really pleasing development. As I've said previously, the currency controls that used to exist didn't have a major practical or a significant impact on us. But we do welcome the simplicity in capital structure and the move towards a more typical OECD regime. I think it also sends a really strong positive message about the country's desire to promote investment and growth. 
So as a result, net debt of $7.6 billion, that's around 1.1x EBITDA, well within our guided range. Now obviously, as we look forward, all subject to the normal caveats, particularly around prices, exchange rates and any impact from COVID, but we would generally expect that number to trend downwards from here towards year-end.
Turning to CapEx on Slide 15. We're staying with our revised guidance, down by $1 billion to $4 billion, to $4.5 billion. And that does include the $300 million of year 1 spend at the Woodsmith project following the Sirius acquisition. 
The decrease in capital driven from a number of factors: weaker local exchange rates; some flexibility in the timing of our critical projects; and obviously, staying focused on our staying business capital spend. That reduction does include $300 million reduction in Quellaveco, and Mark will touch on that a little bit later. But importantly, because of the strength of the balance sheet, we've been able to make every decision for every asset for the right health and safety reason and for the right long-term economic outcome. At the same time, our brownfield projects, the diamond vessel in Namibia and Aquila in met coal remain on track and on budget. And you would have seen our recent announcement of a life extension project at Kumba at the Kolomela mine site. 
So clearly, on Slide 16, we remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation. And so to the scorecard for the half. Over the last 6 months, we maintained our base dividend, $600 million for the final dividend from 2019. And we allocated capital to some discretionary options. So growth capital in total, $0.8 billion for Sirius acquisition and $6 billion on our other growth projects. And we also saw the finalization of the additional shareholder return. So $200 million from the share buyback program. 
So stepping back on Slide 17. Yes, a volatile few months, but we're well placed, and it still remains about balance. We reinstated the dividend in '17, and since then, we have returned $5 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our balance sheet target of no more than 1.5x net debt to EBITDA through the cycle. All of that underpins our growth profile. Our P101 and technology development and the marketing focus on margins allows us to invest sensibly across the business. And that, in turn, will drive our growth in production, EBITDA and cash flow. 
Quellaveco project in Peru, the brownfields project, should deliver a combined 20% to 25% production growth by 2023. In copper equivalent terms, that's really market leading. We believe our long-term EBITDA margins from the mining business can reach that 45% level based on long-term consensus commodity prices. So a real commitment to get the balance right. In terms of balance sheet, returns to shareholders, importantly, relationships with stakeholders and the discretionary allocation of surplus cash flows. 
Mark, back to you."
409115,677161141,2092502,"Anglo American plc, H1 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Anglo American plc","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for",1951,"Okay. Thank you, Stephen. Now looking forward, I think it's important to make the point that the current -- the last 6 months haven't changed our strategic view of things. We do think ESG issues will continue to come to the fore, but we've been there for a long time. And certainly, the work that we've done is starting to be recognized in terms of some of the new industries that are coming out. And our top rating in the FTSE in terms of what we're doing on the ground has been recognized. So from our point of view, all of those things matter. 
Consistent with that approach, and I'm on Slide 19, our work on the portfolio starts obviously around Quellaveco in Peru. Now prior to the onset of COVID-19 in mid-March, we were tracking somewhere between 3 and 4 months ahead of the program. The guys have been doing a fantastic job. When the national quarantine was imposed, the majority of the project's 10,000 strong workforce were demobilized in line with the government's request and asked to head home. So we've helped people get back to home. Construction work, as a consequence, was significantly slowed. And whilst we maintained some critical -- works on critical items, we were substantially stopped across the board. 
With quarantine extended, we then decided to extend the lockdown for 3 months to give a chance for the country to get on top of COVID and, at the same time, so that we could minimize our outgoing cash expenditures with the view that we would then remobilize when we could put in place the workforce and deliver on full productivity. We thought that was the most effective way that we could contribute to the health and safety issues as well as make sure the project, when we hit the button, was able to run as hard as we could. 
So in taking that strategy, we're now on a restart, and it's a staged restart. We've estimated the cost of demobilization, remobilization and the cost of the structural changes we've made across the organization and how we've rescheduled to make sure we reduce the peak of workforce through the process. And in doing that, we've adjusted the financial estimate for the project to between $5.3 billion and $5.5 billion. Now that leaves us with some contingency on the expectation but it still will be a bit of a bumpy ride over the next few months, as we see secondary infections, those sorts of things. But we think we've catered to those properly. 
And at the same time, we still think it's quite reasonable, and our forecast of delivering in 2022 remains on track. In fact, we're on track to the base schedule although we've had to give back, obviously, the big gains we made prior to March. But again, a lot of work is going on to continue to improve that work. 
The last 3 months, we've also been focused on improving the way we bring the operation up through commissioning. And so we haven't completed that work, but we've got some positives there. So we believe we can offset any cost issues and pull back some of that improved value through the way we operate through commissioning.
So I'm pretty pleased with the work the guys have done, and I think we're in really good shape.
In terms of crop nutrients, the U.K., despite a really tough period in lockdown, we were able to get back to work relatively quickly, implemented our social distancing rules. And where we've been somewhere like 30% or 40% above on productivity in the underground operation by changing and reconfiguring. We're not quite at that level above our plan, but we are on track to deliver the planned works for the year. That is the $300 million. So Chris and the guys have done a fantastic job. And as we look at the business and we look at the market potential, we're happier today than we were on the day we bought the asset on the basis of what we've seen. 
The guys have done a great job. Yes, there'll be some technical adjustments but they're at the margin. We think, generally, the team has got the configuration right. And from our point of view, the market and the interest we've had in the market for the product has really been positive, particularly when you think about the new world in terms of fertilizers and what we'll have to see in agriculture in terms of smart use of fertilizers. We think the products will be producing are certainly made-to-order for that new world. So very happy with where we are on Woodsmith. 
In terms of the transition from thermal coal, I think it's important to remember that as we transition out of thermal coal, we're building crop nutrients. And the crop nutrients business probably has got double the potential contribution it can make to the business. So we think that's a pretty good swap. In thermal coal, we've already reduced our footprint by 55%, back in '15, '16 when we sold assets that we didn't think could make a material contribution in the longer term. So we're well on the way. Today, it represents 5% of the EBITDA across the business and probably reducing over time, given the price forecast. We expect to be out of the business within 2 to 3 years. And from our point of view, that's a good place to be. 
But at the same time, we've got to acknowledge that they are and remain low-cost competitive assets, albeit with a relatively shorter mine life than the balance of our assets across the portfolio. But a good pack of assets. Likely a demerger within the next couple of years. We think that's the right decision for Anglo American. 
In terms of our broader portfolio and its positioning in the world that we're looking at in terms of the future, we're certainly positioned to contribute to an environmental-led new materials demand. We've seen the early evolution of electric vehicles and some of the challenges of energy storage. Now we're seeing widespread investment plans in hydrogen, first in China and demand in the automotive sector. We're seeing, obviously, buses in Britain using hydrogen. And now in Europe, we're seeing a much broader application and pull for hydrogen products. 
We've been central to the promotion of hydrogen as the new fuel source. We're a founding member of the Hydrogen Council. And certainly from our point of view, and our involvement in PGMs, gives us a vested interest in making sure that we help support growth in the industry. 
For us, you'll be aware that we're looking at introducing a solar array in South Africa to generate -- or use renewables to generate primary energy, but we'll oversell -- oversize those units and generate hydrogen so we can start converting the major truck fleets to hydrogen consumption as well. 
So from our perspective, it's a great place to be. And most importantly, over the same period and with a greater use of renewables, we also improve our cost structures by reducing energy consumption by 30% by 2030, which is also part of -- and one of the most important drivers of our cost-reduction strategy as well. So one plus one gets three, in terms of what we think hydrogen and other new developments will contribute in terms of our world. 
On Slide 23, you'll see our conversation around having an active route to a greener world and from our point of view, that's where we're going as a business. This approach fits with our commitment towards the environment and minimizing our direct impact and footprint in terms of the communities around us. 
We've committed to making the business carbon neutral by 2040 earlier than most, and that by 2030, we'll have at least 8 operations that will be carbon neutral. Again, it will be a combination of solar, wind and other renewable sources connected to hydrogen and also battery power so that we create closed-loop systems. And the pathway is very clear. The detailed design is still in the works, but we're also starting to move on the pilots that we're looking at developing to demonstrate those pathways. And the platinum business will be 1 of the first places that we develop. And in fact, we'll have our first off-highway truck on hydrogen during the course of this year.
Our new technology and innovation work is also central to this footprint. That 30% energy reduction includes implementation of bulk sorting, coarse particle flotation, bulks orders. We've got in 3 operations already through copper, PGMs and nickel. We've also got coarse particle flotation units being built in the copper business in Chile as we speak. And again, as we go further down line, looking at reducing our water consumption by 50%. And so really changing the nature of the operations, the footprint for the operations, and we hope, creating a model for the industry that will drive us all towards a much greener future and a much more significant contribution to a green future for the planet.
On Slide 24, we talk to the numbers in a very simple way. We're building and evolving a high-quality mix of assets that are suited to future demand and we expect to see improving margins as a consequence of those switch. So a consumer world, an electrified world, a greener world. And from our point of view, our cleaner, greener world products will make up 65% of our portfolio over the next few years. And certainly, from our point of view, even with our contribution in Bulks, we'll have high quality, highly efficient iron ore and met coal, which will make, again, another efficiency and cleaner contribution to the making of steel over the longer term.
On Page 25, we talk to delivery. Like all journeys to a much better place, the road is always not a smooth -- or is not as always smooth as you'd like, but there is no doubt in our progress and our continuing commitment to outpace our competitors in growth and continuing business improvement. As we have along the journey, we will keep learning and getting better. 
And we continue to measure success in sustainability through 3 primary lenses: first, effectiveness. Over the long term, we believe those companies that can generate better than 10% free cash flow will provide the ability to pay dividends and grow their business. And I'm not talking about the next 2 or 3 years, we're talking about the next 10 to 20 years. That's the business we're building. And as we broaden the contribution across our portfolio, you've got a portfolio set for long-term performance. Measuring the efficiency in how we generate those cash returns is just as critical for shareholders. And so our return on capital employed targets make sure that we keep our eye on capital discipline and that we don't throw money at simply generating cash and at the same time, destroying value. 
And being sustainable is absolutely key. So we have our 7 performance pillars: safety; environment; social performance; talent pool, making sure we've got the right people; production and resource base, and the life of assets we have in the portfolio; unit cost position, we continue to improve against our competitors; and ultimately, it's about having a conservative balance sheet that allows us to do the right things and continue to make sensible investments for the long term. 
And so with that, as a differentiated company in terms of assets, capabilities and the ability to deliver long-term returns, that's Anglo American, I'm very happy to take questions."

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work.

I think you've also got to remember, Liam, that with the lower production, you will naturally see lower sustaining capital through the course of the year. We've also done some efficiency work. So when you get those numbers, they balance out pretty well. 
On the carbon neutrality approach, I think, firstly, a comment on pathways. You'll see in Brazil, where we've signed long-term contracts with renewable energy suppliers, doing similar work in Chile. We've got lots of sun in Chile. We've got lots of sun in South Africa and in Queensland. So we want to use solar energy as much as we can. The idea of then oversizing, converting to hydrogen, creating closed loops with battery technologies as well, is pretty well been thought through. And you've got to remember, we're also looking at dropping our energy consumption through the efficiency work that we're doing at a technical level. So I think there's no doubt that we've got a complete solution pretty well thought through, and I think that's what puts us ahead, Liam. 
In terms of the 2040 target, again, we think we're on a good track to get there. We haven't relied on offsets to actually get to those numbers because of all of the work we're doing on the front end. I mean we've been putting the right people on the ground, working all of these solutions out to come up with the position we've taken. Certainly, that leaves us with the ability to look at offsets, if needed. But we really want to drive the business to make a better contribution. In my view, offsets are sort of cheating a little bit in that you're using someone else's credits to cover your own ability or inability to get to 0. So the focus for Anglo American is to get there under our own steam, if you pardon the pun. But at the same time, if we need to do a little bit on the offset side, we'll obviously keep that option open. 
And don't forget with crop nutrients, the idea of improving agricultural production means the world is going to have to use less land for agriculture to actually hit its carbon neutral targets. And so from our point of view, crop nutrients is a significant contributor to what difference we can make and given we've got such a small carbon footprint. So we've thought it through pretty well to get to those numbers."

The offset is a third option, but it hasn't played a major role in how we see ourselves getting to the end result."

So there was a bit of a view coming from investors that Anglo was getting quite confident and quite confident operationally. And I think some people even used the word swagger. And more recently, unfortunately, we've had some fairly serious operational incidents at both Amplat and in met coal. And today, I have the same investors asking me has something gone wrong in Anglo?

And specifically, I'm interested to know how you might be adjusting your operating model or at least the implementation of the operating model to address these incidents?"

In our view -- we're about 50% of the way through the implementation of the detail in the operating model. Where we start is what we call work management, which is about how we get work done, how we plan work and making sure we're delivering as per plan. And that's been the driver between safety improvement, the 90-odd percent, the environmental improvement, the 90%, the health improvement, 90%. And that work has gone well. We call that work management. 
In terms of operating strategy and the detailed technical design work, there's been a lot of good work there, but we're probably still only 50% of the way up to where we want to be. And that includes the change in the control systems we've got. For example, in platinum. We've still got a lot of stuff that's done manually. So there's a lot more automation required. 
And for example, Natascha has introduced 8 new both physical controls and procedural controls in the converter to make sure we don't have the same incident. So we're still working through. We're still learning. We're still a work-in-progress in many ways. To be specific, at Moranbah on the longwall, the area that we started the wall had a little bit different geology, but we applied a standard design. What we've done now is said, look, any of those designs -- and this goes right across the board or any of the major cutback designs, actually have to be signed off 1 level above. Because where you've got a change in circumstance, you really do make sure you've got all the issues covered. So I think that's an important change. And the new design configuration worked extremely well. We got away 3 weeks earlier and the operation has been going well. 
Now we've been implementing digitalization technologies in the management of the longwall, and that's improved our productivity to more than doubled. But there's still more work to be done. The Grosvenor issue in -- call it, a bit of a different issue. And I know a lot of technical people won't understand the issue. We don't think it was an operating issue in terms of the way we would handle things on a day-to-day basis. What appears as though we've had a major fall in the waste area, which all operations have, where you do have some accumulation of gas, where everybody has it. And it's actually flushed, that gas onto the longwall face. 
The question is what may have ignited the gas? And that's where the investigation work now is going on. And we'll find that solution. And I think, ultimately, that will require changes across the industry in the way some of these technologies work. But again, I'm going to let the investigation finish its work. But I think there'll be some changes in the industry. 
In terms of the ACP, again, there were some procedural issues and there were some control issues. I think Natascha is right on that. And to those that I've been talking to in the last few months, my -- I've explained the selection of Natascha in terms of her background in making sure we improve the operation, stability and consistency out of platinum. And even though we've had massive change in the portfolio, our consistency hasn't been as good as it could be. And that's where the focus is. So I'd like to say that the 90% improvement that we've seen across all the dimensions indicates that we've gone somewhere very different to where we are. But we've still got a way to go. We're still not as good as we would like to be, and we're still not at 0 incident. 
So we'll learn, we'll apply the lessons, and we'll keep getting better as we should. Good question."

Mark, I'll deal with the first one, and I'll make some opening comments on the second and then maybe throw it to you. 
So in terms of working capital, if you look at the sort of 3 primary areas, diamonds -- as Mark said, will clearly be market dependent. And it's hard to pick a month, but we're confident the market will come back and demand will flow through quite strongly when it does come back. So without picking the month, whether it happens in November, December or January, February, I'm not too bothered by it. It's really about market coming back, and I know the team are looking at how they can sell diamonds in a different way given the circumstances. So they're working hard on that one. 
On PGMs, given that we're now back up and running at the ACP and the materials flowing out, I'd expect that to come back quite strongly over the next 6 to 9 months. And so you should see -- it may not be all of it, but a substantial portion of that $0.5 billion reverse between now and probably the end of Q1 in 2021.
And copper and Kumba really was just about swells or capacity at the port in Kumba's case. So I think that should close itself out back through Q3. So all things being equal, I'd love to think potentially, you're at least $0.5 billion, maybe a bit extra flushing out of that through the second half. But it is, with all the qualifications that you would expect in terms of prices of markets and further interruptions by COVID. But that's probably about the best guidance I can give you. It's more around timing than absolute amounts. 
In terms of -- just maybe your first comment on our cost guidance, I mean, clearly, some of the businesses have been impacted by the disruptions, and some of that's flowing through into cost structure. Met coal is probably a good example where that's flowing through quite directly into unit costs. And probably the currency hasn't helped in that case as the Aussie dollar strengthened against the U.S. 
In the other markets, yes, copper is probably the standout. Yes, we've seen quite a -- I don't know what the percentage would be, 20% movement in currencies through copper-producing regions. That's clearly helped. And just looking across the others, again, there's no real comment there, given the limited sales through Brazil. Yes, again, we've had some currency movement that's helped. It's probably more in the sort of 10% to 15% range. 
So where we've produced well, you've seen sustainable cost out. And yes, that's been helped by foreign currency. There's no denying that. But you also have seen price movements. And so on Slide 13, I think you can see that those 2 things have largely offset 1 another between currency CPI and price movements. And so there's a bit of give and take across each of those. So rather than just focusing on cost, as I often do, I'd also ask you to focus on the price movement as well. 
Mark, any comments from you on that?"

I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the as",459,"Yes. Look, again, another good question. I think the way I'd characterize where we are, firstly, on average, the assets that we have in the portfolio -- and these are the same assets, so I'm not talking about the portfolio change, I'm talking about the assets that we're operating, are on average doing 30% more in terms of production. And in terms of their actual performance, that group of assets is doing at least 20%. I think it's about 23%, 24% better on unit costs. So we're at another level of performance. And it's interesting our actual underlying performance is actually even better than that, but we're having a little less consistency because we're at a higher level of performance. 
Now people know there's a few of us in the business that are pretty forensic in the way we pull stuff apart and understand what's going wrong and what we need to do to get right. So we've obviously looked at the issues in coal and the ACP issue. But it's actually a much broader view. And we're looking at how we can improve the stability to take another 5% to 10% step on the operating cost side. And the two go hand-in-hand. 
So on the big improvements, we're continuing to make, we're giving about 60% back to inconsistency, and I'm talking about the last 12 months. So we're just working really hard with the teams to get the stability. And so on the basis of the first half, and Stephen stripped away COVID and other movements, we had about a $400 million improvement outside of platinum and met coal. There's about a 4 -- 3% to 4% underlying cost improvement in the business if we can get that stability across the business that we'll take into the new year. So that's what Tony is focusing on with the operating teams, is to get the stability. 
We're working at another level in terms of risks and automation. That work's ongoing with the digital work. So I'm hoping that we're taking 3% to 5% improvement that you're seeing some of it in the underlying performances into next year. But that's 1 we'll talk about at the end of the year once we've seen how far we've come along in terms of improving our stabilities. But the 1 thing I have to say, being in Anglo American is about constant improvement. And when we do have issues, we try and do everything we can to make sure we learn and we apply the lessons across the board. And we've stubbed our toe and we're in the process of making sure that we understand and apply those learnings. And again, we'll keep you posted on that progress over the next 6 months."

So I'll try and unpack them as quickly as I can and deal with each of them. 
Firstly, on the thermal coal transfer, certainly from South Africa, the response from the government has been very positive and constructive. So if we ultimately go down the demerger proposal, and that's the most likely route, we'll certainly, I think, do that in better than 2 years. Cerrejón, people know where we stand on Cerrejón. We will exit at some point. But we are also being very respectful of our 2 partners in terms of our processes. We maintain a dialogue. And at some point in the next 2 or 3 years, I think we'll be gone from there as well. Again, I don't want to be or can't be too hard on the timing of that. Because, again, we've got 2 other -- I was going to say, customers, 2 other competitors and 2 other colleagues that we have in that asset, we're making sure that we deal with that the right way. But again, we should be out of both in that time frame. Certainly, the South African change will be much quicker. 
In terms of met coal, look, the carbon issue is obviously a question. But I think most investors are a little more sophisticated than people give them credit for. They understand that steel is absolutely critical. And that you need met coal in the mix, and it will take time to make the changes. But there's no doubt that in terms of capital allocation, we keep an eye on when those changes and how those trends will change. We do for iron ore as well. Because we will see more recycling by 2035. We think steel will make -- steel recycling will make up 50% of the mix. We think iron ore starts to change shape by 2025. 
So with both iron ore and met coal, we'll keep an eye on capital allocation. We'll tend to operate and run to pull a bit more cash. And our new investments will go into those commodities or products that we think are longer term, the big game changers. And that's why we think we're very different to our competitors, we've got a much longer view. We've got a portfolio that's set up for the future. And certainly, we're making sure people are very clear that we're building this business for long-term performance. 
In terms of De Beers, being consistent on the different product side, in the last 10 years, De Beers have delivered around 10% sustainable free cash flow. So that's before it's growth CapEx. We're currently operating at about 27 million, 28 million carats. We can actually take that up to about 37 million, 38 million carats, if the market is strong. We expect supply to drop away, 15% to 20% in the next 2 or 3 years. You know about Argyle, and there are other changes in the market that are recurring. So structurally, we think the business is in good shape. We are, when you look at it, running the best diamond business in the world, and it has been for 90 years. So there's no reason for us to think differently about that. We think prices will likely be stronger on the basis of supply falling away. There hasn't been a major discovery for 10 years. 
But in terms of what Bruce is doing, the rest of the business has made significant improvement in our cost structures. De Beers has made improvements, but it hasn't come as far down that cost curve, but also, it has to think about the midstream, downstream and its marketing investment. So Bruce is thinking right across the value chain, looking at improving its cost and looking at how we continue to evolve the business for the long term. 
And I know 1 or 2 old timers from De Beers say that it's not like it used to be. Well, it can't be. We're not about shaping this business for the last 20 years, we're about shaping this business for the next 20 years. And so Bruce has worked that we'll talk about in the next little while because, obviously, we have to take all our employees through it, is about improving our costs. It's about making sure structurally the business is set for the long term, and it's about making sure that we're the key supplier getting the right price for a rare product that's becoming rarer. And certainly, we think it's positioned for the long term."

Look, I've seen carbon cost estimates ranging from $20 a tonne to $100 a tonne. I still think that's a moving feast. We look at all the scenarios and try and work out what we think it's worth. 
But if I just looked at the diesel -- current diesel costs, capital costs and operating costs, in looking at the solar array that we're looking at for Mogalakwena, oversizing, providing our primary power source to the plant, and then using excess capacity to generate hydrogen in a closed-loop system and then running our trucks, and it's -- the truck that we're looking at is a fuel cell battery hybrid -- it will be the first off-highway truck in the world designed by the Anglo American people, we've had some people supporting us, but our teams actually designed it. 
We believe the fuel cost on the total cost basis will be actually lower than what it costs us to run that system with energy off the SA grid and diesel fuel imported at global prices. We're not going to talk capital numbers yet. We will start actually explaining those numbers when we start presenting our sustainability strategies and when we talk to the detail on Mogalakwena. 
So we'll start unpacking the detail towards year-end and as we go forward. Stephen, I see your hand up. You'd like to say something?"

And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example.

And you mentioned in your opening comments about some of the renewable power and energy contracts we've got in Brazil and Chile, as an example. They are, in fact, and will be substantially cheaper than what we had in place previously. And I think you'll see more and more of that coming through as you get scale and volume in that sort of segment. 
A couple of other quick comments on that. Yes, a lot of the things that will help us get there are actually really good for our business anyway. So yes, some of the technology improvements, the coarse particle flotation, et cetera, the way we crush is good for the business and good from an ESG perspective. So they're actually a really integrated spend that helped drive you down that course. 
And obviously, some of these contracts and developments would be a question of, well, who spends the capital and how do you pay for that over time, not all of those things will necessarily be us spending the capital, but us getting the benefit of the outcome of that.
Maybe then just a couple of comments, and I'll throw it back to Mark on met coal. Again, capital allocation, we often do think in a 5-, 7-, 10-year world as we allocate capital. And so yes, met coal, I think, will still be a major part of particularly high-grade met coal. A major part of the steel production for 15-plus years. So we're still well inside that in terms of capital allocation. 
The Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, no, that won't be impacted by that. The rapid payback and returns on that, it's really an expansion in efficiencies through the wash plant that will give us the additional volume and returns. And Kapstevel south, as Mark mentioned, took full account of carbon pricing, community expectations, water, all of those sorts of things in our consideration and also has a fairly rapid payback through a 5- to 7-year period. So again, well inside, and again, a high-grade product like we currently produce on Kumba. 
Mark? Thank you."

Thanks, Stephen. That was a good summary. In -- to sort of capture that in a final comment, we believe that the capital implications are not significant on the basis that there will be a combination of what we invest in and Stephen's point around third-party supply, and there are people that are providing different types of structures and deals where they can have shared installations that will reduce our upfront capital cost and are very competitive from an operating cost perspective. And we're in a number of those conversations. And we've seen some of those already come through. 
And on the operating costs are actually then lower than what we've got as infrastructure in place. So it works both ways. And as Stephen said, Moranbah-Grosvenor debottlenecking, obviously, we'll get through the investigations and understand the key issues on Grosvenor. It will change, I suspect, a few things the way we operate. But the debottlenecking is a pretty straightforward project. It's got a rapid payback as has Kapstevel and other types of projects. So we'll continue to invest in the business, but you won't see big step outs in terms of substantial new projects. They're more likely to be in other parts of the business, if I could make it. It's a lean towards other parts of the business as opposed to a massive step out at this point in time. Because the prognosis is still good in met coal and iron ore, but prices will track down, we think, the opportunity to make better returns will shift into those areas over time."

But De Beers and obviously, the ship. But it's a competition for capital. We make judgments about what we think the markets will look like. So nothing less than you would expect. 
In terms of the PGM business, Mogalakwena has a few different types of options. We've got the ability to expand the open cut. And with the new exploration work, we've also got the ability to tee off with shallow declines into high-grade underground ore bodies that give us the ability to utilize our processing infrastructure more effectively. And those costs from those operations are very competitive, and in some cases, lower than the open cut operating costs. 
So as we've done our exploration, we've developed a whole new range of possibilities and options. And so where we should spend in the mine versus on the processing side is we're just trying to look at getting that balance right. We're also creating a lot of low-grade material out of Mogalakwena as well, which is very low-cost material, when you put it through the process. So we're getting those balances right to get the capital allocation right. 
So at the end of the year, we'll be talking about the preferred option for Mogalakwena. And it will likely be a bit more from the open cut future developments in underground, and there will be some processing configuration changes. And we'll try and utilize our facilities with more of our own feed because that will drive us further down the cost curve. So that's 1 example, Tyler. I could go through more, but I think you get the flavor of where we're going."

Look, the sight -- let me just talk in the broad. Firstly, from an operating perspective, and I use [ waning ] as an example, our shovel productivities have improved 40% to 50% and the team is on the trail and chasing some of our best-performing operations. So they'll continue to improve. And so we're taking those into account. The changes that are upper, the nicher productivities, our productivity is across all parts of the operation and looking at continuing to reduce our costs in those parts of the business. That's one. 
Our overheads, our administration has always got to look at tightening up and trimming those costs. We also want to invest more in diamonds and in our brands. Our brand's Forevermark have been growing much quicker than the rest of the industry, and it's very clear that you can get what we think is fair value for your products, if you've got the right brand and people understand what you're trying to do with the product. And so our investment strategy around marketing is very important. 
Given the last 2 or 3 years, and the positive growth we've seen in Forevermark, that's also a very important part of our strategy. So understanding right the way through to the consumers as well as the position with our customers. Now our Sightholder are our direct customers. They are part of the change. We are consulting them in the process. And so they will be part of the restructuring. 
Now to be fair to them, we would -- we think it's important to have those dialogues, but we are flagging. There's an important exercise that we've got to go through in making sure that they understand who will get what, how we'll position those conversations. And I'm not going to preempt what those conversations will look like. But again, the whole value chain has to keep evolving for the world that we have and how we're competing with other discretionary spend products. And so for us, it's a natural evolution. As I said earlier, it's not about the last 20 years, it's about what we see today and for the next 20 years. That's how we're creating De Beers or continuing to transform De Beers."
