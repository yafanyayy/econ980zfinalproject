Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth, as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. 
But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continued to evolve into a higher growth company, as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Invista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we closed, have very good 2019, as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the business' performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team, an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. 
During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition, which we continued to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. 
First, as part of the regulatory approval process, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe. 
When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1%, for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments. 
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. 
Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1% while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. 
Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. 
The Danaher business system continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance, and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. 
All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. 
In life sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points, with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points. 
Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits, with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last 2 years.  
SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical , food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. 
At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. 
IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product line, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher business system and made excellent progress both operationally and commercially. Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers research across a number of genomic application. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. 
Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. 
Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. 
Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. 
While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well, and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DXH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth rooms has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. 
Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. 
At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining, pathology imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new automated, high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. 
Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December, and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive, fast-growing space. 
Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. 
Reported revenue increased 2%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3%, with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate. At Videojet, core revenue was up low single digits, but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. 
Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite, was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko, where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. 
Finally, turning to water quality. 
Core revenue for the quarter increased at a low single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low single digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons, driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation, Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's revenue increased mid-single digits for the quarter and full year. Hach has been a consistent mid single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL 17Fc, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, has water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data, ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. 
At Trojan, core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities. 
And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits, with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. 
So to wrap up. 
2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth, higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher business system as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5% and reflects the impact of 3 additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint, and as mentioned earlier, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma."

Double-digit core growth in the quarter that I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the Life Science side of Pall, double-digit core growth in Life Sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies, that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall, breaking it down into biotech, and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SGT, all combined to give us a tremendous amount of confidence, both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. 
Now we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market, and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall, that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. We don't really see any issues relative to what -- as we've been asked about, in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress, both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process. 
Relative to GE Biopharma, that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules, and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think it will be just a tremendous addition to the portfolio, albeit as a separate stand-alone operating company distinct from Pall."

It was overall a very good quarter in China, Tycho, up high single digits in the fourth quarter, and that was across all 4 of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in DX, and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. Within life science, you know as well as we do, there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food, and to some extent, the pharma market around 4 by 7 that had some impact on 6. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits, and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I'd commented on ex Policy 61, terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. 
Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the new year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly here in the first quarter and could see some impact moving in the second that we continue to work to offset. So we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance, but it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses, by the way, Tycho, that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis, both public and private, including the CDC, to support their efforts, particularly at CDC, supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days a panel of 2 PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So we are in the fight here. But the impact of this, both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business and any of our specific businesses, it's just far too early to tell."

And then as we go forward, we sort of talked about that as this being -- even though it's high-margin business, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year. A higher-margin businesses tend to kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion at the highest highs given the VCM and the fall-through that they already have. So I still think, going forward, using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion even post GE is the right way to think about it, and you'll capture the uplift in the margin in that $0.60, if you will, in 2020."

So we're excited about getting inside and getting with the team and trying to understand those opportunities. Obviously, if we were closed in the business a year ago and had this visibility that we would normally get to 2019, we would have had a higher view, but we'll need a little time to get inside and  see what 2020 ultimately might look like."

And then kind of talking to the Q4 fall through, I mean gross margins were up 50 bps year-over-year, which was helpful. Price was okay here in the quarter. The rest was good. It was kind of running the Danaher playbook. SG&A was down. Gross margins are up. And the volume coming through at 6% was a little bit better than we thought, and that led to a pretty good finish [ year ] to the year, with 100 basis points of margin expansion.

I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there. If you look about our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last 3 years at Beck LS. In the 3 years, pre-acquisition, that business launched 3 new products. So we're 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically, those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our Cytoflex product line and flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomet series that I've talked about, the vital products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a product -- new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS, and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which, by the way, was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. 
If I look over at -- in the diagnostics, a couple of businesses that, again, are clearly gaining share. You got to look at Cepheid as one really good example, and menu expansion continues to be a part of that, certainly, the menu expansion in Fluent strep. But really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs, our integrated delivery networks, has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base, that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base. Over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and 3 point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. 
If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer but where the performance continues to be terrific, I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gap competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have in fact, displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. 
One last one maybe, I'll turn it over to water Quality, where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL 17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But a part of what's driven their cadence is, they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last 2 years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel, I think, substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share."

And as I think you know well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were 2 years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one, the DXA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage, we believe, in the -- in higher volume environments, and the DXA 5000 and our automation capabilities take us, I think, to an even more important level. 
You mentioned hematology. Hematology, the DXH 900. With the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series, both big upgrades to that product line, and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also, I think some important product launches that are in the phone, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes. 
Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a 5, 7, 10-year period. There have been -- there certainly is -- are 1 or 2 out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates but it's always a competitive market, and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line.

We've just come through, I think, at least 2 years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunately for patients and but obviously good for that business. And you can have businesses where -- or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu and driving that installed base, the numbers that I quoted earlier, have been a big part of that. So I think you put all that together and you say, hey, plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better, and based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution."

265621,650224720,1896311,"Danaher Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Jan 30, 2020",2020-01-30,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher.

Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth, as we continued to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. 
But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continued to evolve into a higher growth company, as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close, had a very good 2019, as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the business' performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team, an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. 
During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition, which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. 
First, as part of the regulatory approval process, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe.
When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business is better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments.
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. 
Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1% while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. 
Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. 
The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance, and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. 
All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. 
In life sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points, with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points.
Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits, with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last 2 years. 
SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. 
At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. 
IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product line, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress both operationally and commercially. Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers research across a number of genomic application. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. 
Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit  margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. 
Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. 
Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. 
While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well, and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth [ rooms ] has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. 
Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. 
At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining, pathology imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new automated, high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. 
Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December, and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive, fast-growing space.
Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. 
Reported revenue increased 2%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3%, with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate. At Videojet, core revenue was up low single digits, but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. 
Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite, was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko, where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. 
Finally, turning to water quality.
Core revenue for the quarter increased at a low single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low single digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons, driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation, Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single digits for the quarter and full year. Hach has been a consistent mid single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data, ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. 
At Trojan, core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities.
And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits, with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. 
So to wrap up. 
2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth, higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5% and reflect the impact of 3 additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint, and as mentioned earlier, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma."

So just curious if you could talk a little bit about why you thought things might slow, why they did not, and I guess what's embedded in the guide for Pall Life Sciences going forward?

We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter, double-digit core growth in the quarter that I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies, that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall, breaking it down into biotech, and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT, all combined to give us a tremendous amount of confidence, both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. 
Now we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market, and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall, that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the -- into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. We don't really see any issues relative to what -- as we've been asked about, in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress, both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process.
Relative to GE Biopharma, that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules, and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio, albeit as a separate stand-alone operating company distinct from Pall."

It was overall a very good quarter in China, Tycho, up high single digits in the fourth quarter, and that was across all 4 of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx, and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. Within life science, you know as well as we do, there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food, and to some extent, the pharma market around 4 by 7 that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. PID was up high single digits, and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61, terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. 
Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the new year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly here in the first quarter and could see some impact moving to second but we continue to work to offset. So we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance, but it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses, by the way, Tycho, that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis, both public and private, including the CDC, to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC, supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days a panel of 2 PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So we are in the fight here. But the impact of this, both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business and any of our specific businesses, it's just far too early to tell."

And then as we go forward, we sort of talked about that as this being -- even though it's high-margin business, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact on our 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion every year. Higher-margin businesses tend to kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion at the highest highs then given the [ VCM ] and the fall-through they already have. So I still think, going forward, using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion even post GE is the right way to think about it, and you'll capture the uplift in the margin in that $0.60, if you will, in 2020."

It's inexact science, but I think it's probably 50 to 100 basis points in Q1 would be probably that's worth. And then kind of talking to the Q4 fall through, I mean gross margins were up 50 bps year-over-year, which was helpful. Price was okay here in the quarter. The rest was good. It was kind of running the Danaher playbook. SG&A was down. Gross margins are up. And the volume coming through at 6% was a little bit better than we thought, and that led to a pretty good finish here to the year, with 100 basis points of margin expansion. And I think that's probably the way to think about it."

I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you think -- if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last 3 years at Beck LS. In the 3 years pre-acquisition, that business launched 3 new products. So we're 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically, those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line and flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the vital products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a product -- new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS, and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which, by the way, was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. 
If I look over at -- in the diagnostics, a couple of businesses that, again, are clearly gaining share. You got to look at Cepheid as one really good example, and menu expansion continues to be a part of that, certainly, the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs, our integrated delivery networks, has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base, that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base, over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and 3 point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. 
If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer but where the performance continues to be terrific, I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have, in fact, displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. 
One last one, maybe I'll turn over to water quality, where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But a part of what's driven their cadence is, they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last 2 years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel, I think, substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share."

And as I think you know well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were 2 years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one, the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage, we believe, in the -- in higher volume environments, and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think, to an even more important level. 
You mentioned hematology. Hematology, the DxH 900, with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series, both big upgrades to that product line, and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be, because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also, I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes.
Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a 5-, 7-, 10-year period. There have been -- there certainly is -- are 1 or 2 out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market, and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line.

We've just come through, I think, at least 2 years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunately for patients and -- but obviously, good for that business. And you can have businesses where -- or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu and driving that installed base, the numbers that I quoted earlier, have been a big part of that. So I think you put all that together and you say, hey, plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better, and based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution."

Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth, as we continue to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. 
But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continue to evolve into a higher growth company, as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close, had a very good 2019, as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the business' performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team, an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. 
During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition, which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. 
First, as part of the regulatory approval process, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. 
Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. 
And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe.
When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business' better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments.
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. 
Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1% while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. 
Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. 
The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance, and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. 
All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. 
In life sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points, with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points.
Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits, with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last 2 years. 
SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. 
At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. 
IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product lines, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress both operationally and commercially. 
Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers research across a number of genomic application. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. 
Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. 
Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. 
Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. 
While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman as the team achieved mid single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well, and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. 
We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth runs has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. 
Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. 
At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining. 
Pathology Imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new, automated, high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. 
Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December, and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. 
The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive, fast-growing space.
Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. 
Reported revenue increased 2%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3%, with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate. 
At Videojet, core revenue was up low single digits, but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. 
Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite, was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko, where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. 
Finally, turning to water quality.
Core revenue for the quarter increased at a low single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low single digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons, driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation, Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single digits for the quarter and full year. 
Hach has been a consistent mid single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data, ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. 
At Trojan, core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities.
And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits, with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. 
So to wrap, 2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth, higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5% and reflect the impact of 3 additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint, and as mentioned earlier, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma."

We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter, double-digit core growth in the quarter that I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single use technologies, that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall, breaking it down into biotech, and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT, all combined give us a tremendous amount of confidence, both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. 
Now we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market, and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall, that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the -- into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. 
We don't really see any issues relative to what -- as we've been asked about, in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress, both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process.
Relative to GE Biopharma, that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules, and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio, albeit as a separate stand-alone operating company distinct from Pall."

It was overall a very good quarter in China, Tycho, up high single digits in the fourth quarter, and that was across all 4 of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx, and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. 
Within life science, you know as well as we do, there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food, and to some extent, the pharma market around 4 by 7 that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits, and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61, terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. 
Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the new year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly here in the first quarter and could see some impact moving to second but we continue to work to offset. 
So we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance, but it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses, by the way, Tycho, that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis, both public and private, including the CDC, to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC, supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days a panel of 2 PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So we are in the fight here. But the impact of this, both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business and any of our specific businesses, it's just far too early to tell."

Higher-margin businesses tend to kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion at the highest highs then given the [ VCM ] and the fall through they already have. So I still think, going forward, using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion even post GE is the right way to think about it, and you'll capture the uplift in the margin in that $0.60, if you will, in 2020."

I think we've talked about, we're still going to be active and in the market for sure. 
We will probably be focusing more on some of the bolt-on activity in smaller deals. But also, like we've said, something was of interest and strategically out there for us. We also have talked in the past that if we had to issue equity, we would. So I think -- I don't think the financing necessarily changes anything in the near-term here."

So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains t",504,"Sure. Absolutely. I'd be happy to, Doug. I'll pick a couple of examples looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you think -- if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last 3 years at Beck LS. In the 3 years pre-acquisition, that business launched 3 new products. 
So we're 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically, those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line and flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the [ vital ] products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a product -- new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS, and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which, by the way, was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. 
If I look over at -- in the Diagnostics, a couple of businesses that, again, are clearly gaining share. You've got to look at Cepheid as one really good example, and menu expansion continues to be a part of that, certainly, the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs, or integrated delivery networks, has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base, that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base, over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and 3 point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. 
If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer but where the performance continues to be terrific, I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have, in fact, displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. 
One last one, maybe I'll turn over to water quality, where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But a part of what's driven their cadence is, they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last 2 years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel, I think, substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share."

And as I think you know well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were 2 years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one, the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage, we believe, in the -- in higher volume environments, and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think, to an even more important level. 
You mentioned hematology. Hematology, the DxH 900, with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series, both big upgrades to that product line, and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be, because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. 
So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also, I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes.
Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a 5-, 7-, 10-year period. There have been -- there certainly is -- are 1 or 2 out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market, and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line.

We've just come through, I think, at least 2 years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunate for patients and -- but obviously, good for that business. And you can have businesses where -- or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu and driving that installed base, the numbers that I quoted earlier, have been a big part of that. So I think you put all that together and you'd say, hey, plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better, and based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution."

Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth, as we continue to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innov",2037,"Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. 
Our fourth quarter results wrapped up a tremendous 2019 for Danaher. For the full year, we delivered 6% core revenue growth, as we continue to capture market share in many of our businesses through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. We also delivered 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and $3 billion of free cash flow. 
But the numbers only tell part of Danaher's transformative story in 2019. We continue to evolve into a higher growth company, as we announced the GE Biopharma acquisition and completed the IPO and subsequent split-off of our dental segment into an independent publicly traded company called Envista. GE Biopharma, which will be called Cytiva after we close, had a very good 2019, as core revenue growth of approximately 10% accelerated relative to the business' performance over the past couple of years. We continue to be very impressed with this talented team, an extraordinary group of passionate and highly engaged associates who provide customers with innovative solutions used in the development and production of biopharmaceutical drugs. 
During the fourth quarter, we achieved several important milestones related to the acquisition, which we continue to expect to close in the first quarter of this year. 
First, as part of the regulatory approval process, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell certain of our businesses to Sartorius. The annual revenue to be divested is approximately $170 million and consists of businesses that are currently part of our Life Science platform. 
Secondly, we received conditional clearance for the acquisition from the European Commission in December. While the timing around meeting certain closing conditions can be uncertain, we continue to work constructively with the regulators and remain encouraged by the progress we're making. 
And lastly, we raised approximately $4 billion of U.S. denominated debt in October, which essentially completes the financing needed to fund the acquisition. Overall, financing costs have come in materially better than expected as we were able to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, particularly in Europe.
When we announced the transaction last year, we anticipated financing $18 billion of debt and cash at a blended interest rate of approximately 2.75%, resulting in a total annual interest cost of $500 million. The actual blended interest rate on this $18 billion will be less than 1% for a total annual interest cost of $150 million. As a result, we now believe GE Biopharma will be approximately $0.60 accretive to non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2020. This assumes an end of first quarter close and includes the impact of the lower financing cost and the business' better than 2019 core revenue growth, partially offset by the lost earnings related to the pending divestitures. While not included in our formal 2020 guidance, we wanted to provide you with an update given these recent developments.
Now turning to our fourth quarter results. 
Sales grew 5.5% to $4.9 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by approximately 1% while acquisitions increased revenues by 50 basis points. Core revenue increased 6%. 
Geographically, high-growth markets increased at a high single-digit rate, led by China and India. In the developed markets, the U.S. remains strong, delivering high single-digit growth, while Western Europe was up mid-single digits. 
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.5% and operating profit margin was 19.8%. Core operating margin increased 175 basis points in the quarter, bringing full year core operating margin expansion to 100 basis points, a testament to the team's terrific execution across the portfolio. 
The Danaher Business System continues to be the primary driver of our strong core operating margin performance, and 2019 marked the fifth consecutive year that we expanded core operating margins by 70 basis points or more. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.28 were up double digits year-on-year, bringing full year adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $4.42. 
All in all, a strong finish to a very important year. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. 
In life sciences, reported revenue increased 7% and core revenue increased 6.5% for the quarter. Operating profit margin of 21.2% was up 150 basis points, with 190 basis points of core margin expansion. For the full year, life sciences achieved 7% core revenue growth and delivered operating margin expansion of 145 basis points.
Core growth at Beckman Life Sciences was up mid-single digits, with strength across most major geographies and product lines. This finished off another great year for Beckman as the business grew high single digits and surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. New product introductions have been a key driver in Beckman's success and contributed more than 250 basis points to core growth each of the last 2 years. 
SCIEX core revenue was up low single digits versus the high single-digit prior year comparison. Performance improved sequentially, with particular strength in the pharmaceutical, food and environmental end markets. Geographically, core growth in the quarter was led by North America and Asia, which was particularly offset -- which was partially offset by softness in China. 
At Pall, the team achieved its second straight year of high single-digit core revenue growth, with nearly 10% core growth in the fourth quarter. Strong momentum in our biotech and aerospace businesses was partially offset by expected weakness in microelectronics. 
IDT achieved double-digit core revenue growth, led by synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing product lines, where newly launched products are gaining market share. Since joining Danaher in 2018, the IDT team has embraced the Danaher Business System and made excellent progress both operationally and commercially. 
Using DBS growth tools, they've enabled cross-functional teams to collaborate more effectively during the product development process to improve quality and reduce time to market. With this more focused approach to innovation, IDT has increased their cadence of new product launches and expanded their best-in-class offering to further customers’ research across a number of genomic application. 
Moving now to Diagnostics. Reported revenue increased 7% in the quarter, with core revenue growth of 8%. Reported operating profit margin was 19.5%, with reported and core operating margins up 70 basis points. 
Over the last few years, we've made significant strategic investments, both organically and inorganically, to better position our Diagnostics platform and oriented towards higher growth opportunities. We're seeing the impact of these initiatives as the Diagnostics team delivered 7% core revenue growth in 2019, a continuation of the market share gains we've achieved over the last few years. 
Turning to Beckman Diagnostics. 
While core revenue was up only low single digits in the quarter on a difficult prior year comparison, 2019 was a great year for Beckman as the team achieved mid-single-digit core revenue growth, their best annual core growth rate since we acquired the business in 2011. China continued to perform well, and positive results across all major product lines were led by double-digit growth in automation. 
We've improved Beckman's growth trajectory over the last few years by focusing on impactful new product development and improved commercial execution. Our launch of the DxH series of new hematology analyzers has been a key contributor to improvement in core revenue growth. And on the commercial side, our North American sales team's effective implementation of DBS growth runs has helped drive double-digit gains in our customer retention rate. 
Radiometer achieved double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out their 15th consecutive year of mid-single-digit or better core growth, a remarkable achievement. Results were strong across both the developed and high-growth markets, as we believe Radiometer continued to gain share relative to the market. 
At Leica Biosystems, double-digit core revenue growth was driven by positive results across all major geographies and product lines. In addition to continued strength in core histology and advanced staining. 
Pathology Imaging also had a strong quarter, driven by demand for new products like the Aperio GT 450. The GT 450 is a new, automated, high-capacity digital pathology slide scanner that enables extensive biopsy databases to be digitized, making them more accessible for researchers around the world. 
Core revenue at Cepheid was up more than 20% for the quarter, with broad-based strength across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. The business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue in December, and we couldn't be happier for the team to hit this major growth milestone. Since the 2016 acquisition, core revenue has compounded annually at a rate of approximately 20%. 
The team has done a terrific job incorporating DBS commercial tools and processes to enhance their go-to-market strategy as well. With an installed base of more than 20,000 instruments and the largest molecular test menu available on the market today, Cepheid is poised to continue taking share in this highly attractive, fast-growing space.
Moving now to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. 
Reported revenue increased 2%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. Reported operating margin increased to 25.3%, with 265 basis points of core margin expansion. In Product Identification, core revenue grew at a low single-digit rate. 
At Videojet, core revenue was up low single digits, but performance accelerated sequentially. Strength in North America and Western Europe was partially offset by softness in the high-growth markets. By end market, consumer products and food and beverage led the way. 
Our packaging businesses, which includes Esko and X-Rite, was up mid-single digits. We had a particularly good quarter at Esko, where growth rate was led by demand for our brand owner software, including BLUE, a business we acquired 18 months ago. BLUE provides label and artwork management software that enhances Esko's offering in the packaging development and production workflow. As a result, the Esko team is helping customers reduce the time it takes to bring new products to market while improving cost and quality across their packaging value chain. 
Finally, turning to water quality.
Core revenue for the quarter increased at a low single-digit rate. Core revenue at Hach increased low single digits. However, the fourth quarter represented the last period of tough prior year comparisons, driven by China's surface water monitoring regulation, Policy 61. Excluding the Policy 61 impact, Hach's core revenue increased mid-single digits for the quarter and full year. 
Hach has been a consistent mid-single-digit growth business throughout its 20-year tenure as a Danaher operating company. And this success has been largely driven by the team's commitment to solving challenging customer problems through innovative applications and workflow solutions. One example is the recently launched CL17 FC, Hach's new online chlorine analyzer, which is easy to use and is equipped with Claros, Hach's water intelligence software. This combination of innovative hardware and software solutions helps customers more effectively manage their connected instruments, their processes and data, ultimately lowering their operating costs, increasing compliance and reducing risk. 
At Trojan, core revenue declined in the quarter due to the timing of certain large projects, but the team delivered impressive double-digit core growth for the full year. Trojan's growth acceleration in 2019 was driven by a combination of recent new product launches and commercial initiatives focused on expanding field service capabilities.
And lastly, core revenue at ChemTreat was up mid-single digits, with particular strength in the chemical and food and beverage end markets. 
So to wrap, 2019 was an outstanding year for Danaher and marked our 35th anniversary as a company. Over the course of that time, through a combination of organic and inorganic initiatives, we've transformed into a higher-growth, higher-margin and higher recurring revenue company. With a resilient portfolio that's built for the future and the Danaher Business System as our consistent driving force, we feel well positioned to continue to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $1.06 to $1.09. This assumes core revenue growth of 6% to 6.5% and reflect the impact of 3 additional selling days versus the first quarter last year. We're also initiating full year 2020 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.80 to $4.90, which implies double-digit growth year-over-year at the midpoint, and as mentioned earlier, does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of GE Biopharma."

We're really, really very pleased with how Pall performed in the quarter, double-digit core growth in the quarter that I've mentioned was led by biotech and aerospace. And if you sort of break that down and go in specifically into the life science side of Pall, you have double-digit core growth in life sciences. We've talked in the past about single-use technologies, that certainly was a portion of that growth. Single-use continues to grow at better than 20%. And so I think the combination of just looking at life sciences overall, breaking it down into biotech, and then looking specifically at that high-growth area of SUT, all combined give us a tremendous amount of confidence, both in terms of Pall's positioning in that market, but also the end market strength. And so I think we feel very good about that. 
Now we try to be prudent here early in the year in terms of how we embed different segments of the business into our overall guide. And so I think we sort of look into 2020 and think about the overall biopharma market, and our position there is perhaps a little bit more normalized at high single digits in 2020. But overall, that's not to suggest that we think this is about a market slowdown or there's any overcapacity issues. It's really about just saying that, hey, this 2019 was a great year. We're probably a little prudent going into the -- into 2020, but this is absolutely a fantastic market to be a part of. 
We don't really see any issues relative to what -- as we've been asked about, in terms of overcapacity in the market. We continue to track the volumes of individual drugs that are being produced, and that really is the indicator. And we continue to see just tremendous progress, both in terms of the drug development pipeline and the volume ramps of individual biopharmaceuticals where essentially we are integrated into the process.
Relative to GE Biopharma, that obviously improves our position in the overall market. It gives us broader exposure specifically to the biopharmaceutical market, large molecules, and those more advanced technologies given GE's exceptional position in chromatography. And so we're looking forward to closing that transaction here in the first quarter. And we think it will be just a tremendous addition to the overall portfolio, albeit as a separate stand-alone operating company distinct from Pall."

It was overall a very good quarter in China, Tycho, up high single digits in the fourth quarter, and that was across all 4 of the platforms. And we saw high single digits in Dx, and that was broad based in terms of the strength that we saw. 
Within life science, you know as well as we do, there's some policy and regulatory noise around the food, and to some extent, the pharma market around 4 by 7 that had some impact on SCIEX. But generally, we expect continued good performance from both of those platforms and both of those markets. Even PID was up high single digits, and that was largely Esko and Videojet. And in water quality, I think I commented on ex Policy 61, terrific. So I think as we look forward in China, we see continued good growth opportunities there. 
Specific to the coronavirus situation. Obviously, it's a very challenging situation to get a clear handle on in terms of what its overall impact is. We have not seen any specific impact to this point on our business. That was before everyone left for the new year. And as you know, certain provinces are extending the Chinese New Year at this point. And that's obviously a little bit of a wildcard here in the first quarter. So losing potentially an extra week could have an impact on both sales and the supply chain. But given that it's early in the quarter, we'll be working to offset that certainly here in the first quarter and could see some impact moving to second but we continue to work to offset. 
So we haven't incorporated any of that into any guidance, but it's just too early to tell. We're hoping for the best. We have businesses, by the way, Tycho, that are actively involved in taking on this challenge. Both Cepheid and IDT are engaged in -- with outside parties on a global basis, both public and private, including the CDC, to support their efforts -- particularly at CDC, supporting the CDC efforts around releasing just in the last couple of days a panel of 2 PCR probes and primers that are designed specifically to detect the virus. So we are in the fight here. But the impact of this, both in terms of the overall Chinese market, our business and any of our specific businesses, it's just far too early to tell."

Higher-margin businesses tend to kind of not necessarily have the best margin expansion at the highest highs then given the VCM and the fall-through they already have. So I still think, going forward, using 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion even post GE is the right way to think about it, and you'll capture the uplift in the margin in that $0.60, if you will, in 2020."

I'll pick a couple of examples looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains t",502,"Sure. Absolutely. I'd be happy to, Doug. I'll pick a couple of examples looking across the portfolio. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about some terrific performance at Beckman Life Science. So to give you an example of what's driving the share gains there, if you think -- if you look at our -- the cadence of new products, we've introduced over 20 new products in the last 3 years at Beck LS. In the 3 years pre-acquisition, that business launched 3 new products. 
So we're 7x the cadence of new product introductions. And specifically, those are going into higher growth applications like biologics and genomics, obviously, our CytoFLEX product line and flow cytometry and the reagents associated with that, the new automation products and the Biomek series that I've talked about, the buy-sell products in particle counting, all those things are really contributing from a product -- new product innovation standpoint to share gains at Beck LS, and that's why we're seeing that meaningful step-up in growth at Beck LS, which, by the way, was virtually a flat growth business when we acquired it. 
If I look over at -- in the Diagnostics, a couple of businesses that, again, are clearly gaining share. You've got to look at Cepheid as one really good example, and menu expansion continues to be a part of that, certainly, the menu expansion in flu and strep, but really good commercial execution. Expansion into IDNs, or integrated delivery networks, has made a big difference. I think if you look at that installed base, that we've now grown from 13,000 systems at acquisition to 23,000 in the installed base, over 40 major health systems that have been converted, 11 new assays and 3 point-of-care systems. I mean these are the things that I think underpin our confidence and our belief in the share gains at a place like Cepheid. 
If I look at a business that has been with us certainly a lot longer but where the performance continues to be terrific, I talked about the 15th consecutive year of good performance at Radiometer and their share gains. We've seen a 50% increase in blood gas competitive takeaways in 2019 alone. So we track every competitive situation and we can be clear about where we have, in fact, displaced a competitive instrument. So I think good examples there. 
One last one, maybe I'll turn over to water quality, where Hach has really improved their new product cadence. A lot of terrific products beyond the CL17 that I talked about in my prepared remarks. But a part of what's driven their cadence is, they have cut their new product development time by 50% in the last 2 years. And at the same time, they've driven ideation and improved the nature of what's in the funnel, I think, substantially. And so again, we track our installed base as we track competitive win rates. And I think those trackers clearly give us confidence in the areas where we're gaining share."

And as I think you know well, that's 100 basis points higher than where we were 2 years ago. And a number of things have combined here. The new product launches that we've talked about in the last year or so. Automation being one, the DxA 5000. We've always had a competitive advantage, we believe, in the -- in higher volume environments, and the DxA 5000 and our automation capability take us, I think, to an even more important level. 
You mentioned hematology. Hematology, the DxH 900, with the early sepsis indicator as well as the 500 series, both big upgrades to that product line, and those are making a difference without a doubt. And they will continue to be because it's still early days in terms of the penetration of those new products into the market. 
So we're expecting as we go forward, we'll continue to see solid mid-single-digit growth from that business. And I think that will come from some of the things I just mentioned, but also, I think some important product launches that are in the funnel, closing the menu gaps around infectious disease and blood virus and ensuring that we are architecting the hardware side of the house in a way that positions us well at lower volumes.
Relative to competitive launches, obviously, this is a business where every competitor cycles through new product launches over a 5-, 7-, 10-year period. There have been -- there certainly is -- are 1 or 2 out there right now. At this point, we haven't really seen any material impact to us on our retention or our win rates, but it's always a competitive market, and we'll be keeping pace in terms of the competitiveness of our product line.

And obviously, since that acquisition, at 20% better, that's been higher than we've expected, and it's -- there's a number of factors there, a lot of which, I think -- a couple of which you might say are somewhat a function of the nature of that business being impacted by flu. 
We've just come through, I think, at least 2 years in a row here with a particularly strong flu season. We don't bank on that obviously. That's something that we can have a strong season, which is unfortunate for patients and -- but obviously, good for that business. And you can have businesses where -- or a season where that's not the case. And so we tend to be somewhat prudent in terms of how we anticipate those seasonal factors to play out. That said, the growth of that business has been certainly sustained by more than just flu. The work they've done in expanding the menu and driving that installed base, the numbers that I quoted earlier, have been a big part of that. So I think you put all that together and you'd say, hey, plan prudently relative to an uplift from something like a flu season, but have confidence that we can sustain that at least a low double-digit growth rate for sure, if not better, and based on the fact that they continue to innovate effectively and have really stepped up their commercial execution."

I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. 
Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. 
Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive, as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts. 
Given how top of mind, the impact of the virus is, we thought we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. 
Before we run through our first quarter results, I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. 
I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition. 
At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. 
These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses. But they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community and the unprecedented fight against COVID-19. 
We're proud to support frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. 
As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curve the spread of COVID-19. 
IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. 
To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus. 
In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. 
With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the U.S., cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. 
Since Cepheid's test became available, the team has shipped approximately 2 million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6 million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations. 
Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best-in-class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. 
The market-leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on. 
At Beckman Culture Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. 
We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. 
Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high sensitivity automated IgG serology test. 
The team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2 million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. 
This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers. 
As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. 
Pall's filtration solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. 
These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and ultimately a cure. 
Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on Board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. 
With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis. 
Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. 
Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter. 
So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. 
The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. 
Geographically, high single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single-digit declines in high-growth markets. 
Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. 
While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions. 
Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. 
We generated  $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position. 
Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. 
Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5%, with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. 
The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. 
That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses like microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. 
This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research, as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth, led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. 
Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth, with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. 
Particular strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. 
We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March. 
Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. 
With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented health care challenge and beyond. 
Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. 
These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not cove -- not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. 
In our Water Quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world. A mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined towards the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures. 
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding, offset by declines in our Packaging Solutions businesses. 
At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter in place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases. 
So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS driven execution and differentiated portfolio, enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis. 
So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. 
We continue to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. 
In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. 
Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. 
However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders, and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work. 
Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. 
This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. 
We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs. 
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods in medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. 
The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China. 
China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen, and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. 
In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. 
In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth, including Cytiva, to be in the range of flat to down 10%. 
So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. 
True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. 
Never before, have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion. 
Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. 
We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio, exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. 
Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. 
After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last 6 as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. 
I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio, enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business system, create a strong foundation for continued outperformance. 
I have loved every day of the past 3 decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. 
I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing town. 
And I can now look back finally on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. 
I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months, and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come. 
Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP, leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile, while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva, to name just a few. 
There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. 
With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Reiner is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders. 
So what's next for me? Well, first off, that question is one for several months from now. 
But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of Medstar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. 
I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1 of this year, and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work, because we have a lot to do in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions. 
Thanks, Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Crystal, we're now ready for questions."

Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. 
And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid, we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build. 
Radiometer also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. 
So I think, overall, you'd consider Cepheid Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. 
What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, like biosystems a bit that are more patient volume dependent, and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures, starts to return. 
But certainly, the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID, no doubt. 
So now putting all that together, you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. 
So I think that's the way I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2."

And -- but as we look forward, I think we have really, as you can imagine, we just closed the end of March, 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time, depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. 
So I think we've got an outstanding start here. But in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. 
Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint, given the limitations we have here on travel. 
So right now, we're going to focus on, obviously, a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. 
So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year. Once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look, and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year."

So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last 5 or 6 years. We always want to do something like this when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the over. 
It was super important that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. 
So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. I am really excited about and the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role, and he's just going to do a fantastic job. So we all feel great about it."

And I think in many respects, we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short-term and the long term. 
I think if you start with -- from a diagnostic testing perspective, Cepheid's impact, along with IDT, Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as Beckman and serology and IGG testing, I think that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities. 
Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think, as you know well, we are 1 of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here, you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. 
And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge job -- same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid. 
Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening, we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. 
And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture. And so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have and god willing, we will have both therapies as well as vaccines. 
In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven, obviously, with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. 
And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable, and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay test. 
And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests, as I think Matt said earlier, wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing, that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. 
So I think a lot of terrific potential there, particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time. 
In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs, meaning filtration and resins, to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. 
Right now, we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic in vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. 
And so obviously, there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. 
So I think good spot to be in."

I don't know if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher, he came in initially as the President of Videojet. 
And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife Alan had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we have this outstanding leader just come into Videojet and the real need at SCIEX and Rainer repacked and moved Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years, and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. 
And so when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the 2 of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question, and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the 2 of us than than I will. 
He's an outstanding individual. He is supersmart. He is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled. 
So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the 2 of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher, and I am supremely confident that, that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one."

I will tell you that probably in Q2 in Diagnostics, though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals, and that's all related to FX.  So that delta will be because of FX here in the quarter.

We kicked that off virtually using Microsoft teams just 2 weeks ago, I kicked it off. Rainer was on the call, John Sekowski, who you know from our DBS office, led the effort. 
We probably touched. We got more people through that ECO over that day, 1.5 days, I forget the full duration because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so a digital tool. And so answer is we're working. We're doing our best. We're off to a good start. We've got to get creative. We've got to invent new ways to get things done.

When water quality testing has to be done every single day in municipalities around the world, when consumer package have to be marked to ship every single day around the world, those consumables continue to underpin reasonably steady performance. I mean, they are a safety net under the revenue structures of those businesses. 
And while there'll be some other dimensions, the -- like the equipment side in water quality, for example, or even in PID and some of the software businesses that will be a little bit more pressured here. I think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times.

I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts.
Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is, we felt we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. Before we run through our first quarter results, I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition.
At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength, with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses. But they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19.
We're proud to support the frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today, and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19.
IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus.
In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the U.S., Cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. Since Cepheid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately 2 million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6 million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations.
Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The market-leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on.
At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high-sensitivity automated IgG serology test. The team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2 million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers.
As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. Pall's Filtration Solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and, ultimately, a cure.
Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis.
Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter.
So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single-digit declines in high-growth markets. Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions.
Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. We generated $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position.
Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. 
Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5%, with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, Leica Microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns.
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth, led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth, with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particularly, strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March.
Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented health care challenge and beyond.
Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID -- were not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. In our Water Quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world, a mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures.
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our Packaging Solutions businesses. At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases.
So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis.
So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products.
However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders, and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work.
Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs.
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China.
China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen, and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth, including Cytiva, to be in the range of flat to down 10%. 
So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant, and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion.
Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio, exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. 
Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last 6 as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio, enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business System create a strong foundation for continued outperformance.
I have loved every day of the past 3 decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing talent. And I can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months, and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come.
Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP, leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile, while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva, to name just a few. There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders.
So what's next for me? Well, first off, that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of MedStar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1 of this year, and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions."

Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid -- we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity, but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build.
Radiometer, also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. So I think, overall, you'd consider Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. 
What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems, a bit that are more patient volume-dependent, and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return. But certainly, the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business, like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID, no doubt.
So now putting all that together, you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. So I think that's the way I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2."

And -- but as we look forward, I think we have really -- as you can imagine, given we just closed the end of March, 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here.

Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint, given the limitations we have here on travel.
So right now, we're going to focus on, obviously, a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs, and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look, and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year."

Absolutely, Tycho, I'd be happy to. I can honestly say that you would have to go all the way back to my very first year in the role where we, along with the Board, made sure that we talked about talent development, about ensuring that we are progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point where we are today and had an outstanding choice in Rainer Blair to succeed me.
So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last 5 or 6 years. We always want to do something like this when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over.
It was superimportant that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. I am really excited about Rainer and the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role, and he's just going to do a fantastic job. So we all feel great about it."

There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID, and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned, both on the short-term and the long term.I think if you start with, from a diagnostic t",571,"Sure. Thanks, Tycho. There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID, and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned, both on the short-term and the long term.
I think if you start with, from a diagnostic testing perspective, Cepheid's impact along with IDT, Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as Beckman and serology and IgG testing, I think that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities.
Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think, as you know well, we are one of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here, you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge, obviously, with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid.
Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening, we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture, and so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have, and god willing we will have, both therapies as well as vaccines.
In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven, obviously, with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology test, the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable, and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests, as I think Matt said earlier, wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing, that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. So I think a lot of terrific potential there, particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time.
In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs, meaning filtration and resins, to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now, we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously, there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. So I think a good spot to be in."

I don't know if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher, he came in initially as the President of Videojet. And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife, Elaine, had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we had this outstanding leader who had just come into Videojet, and the real need at SCIEX, and Rainer repacked and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years, and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then, through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. 
And so when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the 2 of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question, and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the 2 of us than I will. He's an outstanding individual, he is supersmart, he is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled.
So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the 2 of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher, and I am supremely confident that, that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one."

But I think starting with 40% is a good place to start. I will tell you that probably in Q2 in Diagnostics, though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals, and that's all related to FX.

I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts.
Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is, we felt we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. Before we run through our first quarter results, I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition.
At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength, with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses. But they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19.
We're proud to support the frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today, and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19.
IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus.
In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the U.S., Cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. Since Cepheid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately 2 million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6 million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations.
Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The market-leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on.
At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high-sensitivity automated IgG serology test. The team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2 million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers.
As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. Pall's Filtration Solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and, ultimately, a cure.
Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis.
Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter.
So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single-digit declines in high-growth markets. Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions.
Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. We generated $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position.
Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. 
Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5%, with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, Leica Microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns.
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth, led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth, with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particularly, strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March.
Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented health care challenge and beyond.
Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID -- were not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. In our Water Quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world, a mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures.
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our Packaging Solutions businesses. At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases.
So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis.
So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products.
However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders, and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work.
Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs.
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China.
China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen, and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth, including Cytiva, to be in the range of flat to down 10%. 
So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant, and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion.
Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio, exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. 
Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last 6 as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio, enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business System create a strong foundation for continued outperformance.
I have loved every day of the past 3 decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing talent. And I can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months, and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come.
Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP, leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile, while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva, to name just a few. There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders.
So what's next for me? Well, first off, that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of MedStar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1 of this year, and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions."

Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid -- we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity, but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build.
Radiometer, also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. So I think, overall, you'd consider Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. 
What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems, a bit that are more patient volume-dependent, and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return. But certainly, the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business, like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID, no doubt.
So now putting all that together, you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. So I think that's the way I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2."

And -- but as we look forward, I think we have really -- as you can imagine, given we just closed the end of March, 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here. But in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint, given the limitations we have here on travel.
So right now, we're going to focus on, obviously, a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs, and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look, and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year."

So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last 5 or 6 years. We always want to do something like this when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over.
It was superimportant that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along.

Thanks, Tycho. There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID, and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned, both on the short-term and the long term.
I think if you start with, from a diagnostic testing perspective, Cepheid's impact along with IDT, Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as Beckman and serology and IgG testing, I think that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities.
Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think, as you know well, we are one of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here, you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge, obviously, with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid.
Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening, we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture, and so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have, and god willing we will have, both therapies as well as vaccines.
In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven, obviously, with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology test, the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable, and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests, as I think Matt said earlier, wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing, that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. So I think a lot of terrific potential there, particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time.
In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs, meaning filtration and resins, to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now, we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously, there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. So I think a good spot to be in."

I don't know if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher, he came in initially as the President of Videojet. And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife, Elaine, had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we had this outstanding leader who had just come into Videojet, and the real need at SCIEX, and Rainer repacked and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years, and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then, through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. 
And so when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the 2 of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question, and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the 2 of us than I will. He's an outstanding individual, he is supersmart, he is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled.
So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the 2 of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher, and I am supremely confident that, that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one."

I think that's probably a reasonable place for the business to be here in the second quarter as well.  So I think your math on that is pretty correct.
As far as decremental margins go, I think the place that I'd start is probably about 40% decrementals. It can vary quite a bit depending on mix, et cetera. But I think starting with 40% is a good place to start. I will tell you that probably in Q2 in Diagnostics, though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals, and that's all related to FX.  So that delta will be because of FX here in the quarter. So 40% overall maybe a touch higher here in Q2 in Diagnostics."

When water quality testing has to be done every single day in municipalities around the world, when consumer packaged goods have to be marked and shipped every single day around the world, those consumables continue to underpin reasonably steady performance. I mean, they are a safety net under the revenue structures of those businesses.
And while there'll be some other dimensions, the -- like the equipment side in water quality, for example, or even in PID and some of the software businesses that will be a little bit more pressured here, I think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times. So I wouldn't trade those businesses for any in their markets."

I'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contributions during this unprecedented time. Their response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been humbling and inspiring. They're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can continue to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work. Our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded. Every one of our associates, customers and business partners is making a difference today, and I'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts.
Given how top of mind the impact of the virus is, we felt we would structure the call a little differently this quarter. Before we run through our first quarter results, I'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight COVID-19. I'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of April, and I'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming CEO transition.
At Danaher, we are incredibly fortunate to navigate these turbulent times from a position of strength, with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the Danaher Business System as our driving force. These recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our businesses. But they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against COVID-19.
We're proud to support the frontline health care providers with much needed diagnostic testing capabilities today, and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future. As we collectively strive to contain this novel virus, diagnostic testing provides essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19.
IDT was an early leader in this effort, as their primer and probe kits provide a key detection component in COVID-19 diagnostic tests. To date, IDT has shipped kits to enable more than 30 million diagnostic tests for the virus.
In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test related to COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. With a leading global installed base of more than 23,000 molecular diagnostic instruments, including 5,000 in the U.S., Cepheid's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect health care workers. Since Cepheid's tests became available, the team has shipped approximately 2 million test cartridges. And going forward, we now expect to be able to ship approximately 6 million tests per quarter, greatly exceeding our initial expectations.
Recently published independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The market-leading caliber of Cepheid's test, combined with their significant production ramp up, is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on.
At Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus. We expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. Beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly, a high-sensitivity automated IgG serology test. The team plans to ramp production capability to more than 2 million tests in May and over 30 million tests per month by the end of June. This assay will be able to run on Beckman's global installed base of more than 16,000 immunoassay analyzers.
As we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19, Pall and Cytiva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world, who are working tirelessly to find a cure. Pall's Filtration Solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates. And Cytiva is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development, providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes. These are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers' important pursuit of COVID-19 testing, treatment, prevention and, ultimately, a cure.
Speaking of Cytiva, I want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to Danaher. We're thrilled to have them on board. With the addition of Cytiva, we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive biopharmaceutical end market to more than $5 billion, which represents approximately 50% of our Life Science platform's annual revenue. With a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow, we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost, an important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis.
Cytiva is off to a great start here in 2020 and achieved approximately 10% revenue growth in its first quarter. Given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results, we will include Cytiva's performance as part of our overall core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter.
So now let's take a look at our first quarter results. Sales grew 3% to $4.3 billion, driven by 4.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 1.5%. Geographically, high single-digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single-digit declines in high-growth markets. Revenue in China was down more than 25% as a result of extensive shutdowns related to COVID-19. While January and February were solid across North America and Western Europe, we saw a downturn in demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions.
Gross profit margin for the first quarter was 56.2% and operating profit margin was 16.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.05. We generated $694 million of free cash flow, a 21% increase year-over-year, helping to support our strong financial position.
Now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio. 
Life Science reported revenue increased 1.5%, with core revenue growth of 2.5%, led by high single-digit or better core revenue growth at Pall, IDT and Beckman Life Sciences. The global effort to develop COVID-19-related testing and treatment drove demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. That strong performance was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, Leica Microsystems and SCIEX, which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases. This dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to COVID-19-related shutdowns.
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 6%, with 8% core revenue growth, led by very strong results at our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Cepheid achieved more than 40% core revenue growth, with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies. Particularly, strength in Cepheid's flu assay was driven by the combination of a more severe flu season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak. We also saw early strong demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 test, which received U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March.
Our Radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth. Surges in hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-19 drove demand for Radiometer's blood gas instruments and tests, a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients. With the largest global installed base of blood gas instruments, Radiometer is well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented health care challenge and beyond.
Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' core revenue decreased mid-single digits. Solid performance in North America and Western Europe was offset by significant declines in China as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in January. These containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not COVID -- were not related to COVID-19, which greatly reduced core laboratory testing volumes.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 1%, with 2.5% core revenue growth. In our Water Quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue growth was led by double-digit core revenue growth at ChemTreat. Our Water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world, a mission-critical service in any economic environment. Good demand for our consumables and chemistries continued, while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone larger expenditures.
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down low single digits, with growth in marking and coding offset by declines in our Packaging Solutions businesses. At Videojet, equipment sales were down, but we saw strong demand for consumables across consumer packaged goods, medical and food and beverage end markets, as widespread shelter-in-place orders drove a surge in consumer purchases.
So the first quarter was challenging on many fronts. But we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis.
So moving on to what we saw in April. The trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of March. We continued to see a bifurcation across our life science end markets. COVID-19-related research and development increased significantly over the last 60 days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers, particularly in areas like antiviral therapies, vaccine development and immune response research and testing. In turn, this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Good momentum also continued for other non-COVID-19 related bioprocessing, driving demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products.
However, most academic research labs in the U.S. and Europe remained closed and labs in China have only recently started to reopen. These closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders, and it appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work.
Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continued to see very strong demand through April for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving increased instrument placements globally. This contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs, where the significant declines in elective procedures, emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes. We also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs.
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment persisted through April. Consumables remain solid, as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods and medicine. But equipment purchases are being delayed as mission-critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments. The cadence of these end market dynamics appears to be consistent with the spread of the virus, with the negative impact in North America and Western Europe trailing that of China.
China gradually improved in April, as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen, and revenue growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter. In North America and Western Europe, we believe that declines are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months, as these regions begin to gradually reopen. In light of these recent trends, we expect second quarter core revenue growth, including Cytiva, to be in the range of flat to down 10%. 
So to wrap up, as I reflect on the events of the last few months, I am humbled by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis. True to our core values, our associates are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges. Never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant, and I'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion.
Looking ahead, we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment. We believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio, exceptional team and DBS-driven execution will continue to differentiate Danaher in 2020 and beyond. 
Now before we go to Q&A, I want to address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming CEO transition. After more than 30 years at Danaher, including the last 6 as CEO, I've decided to begin the transition to retirement. I do this knowing that Danaher has never been stronger. The combination of our portfolio, enhanced execution around innovation and our seasoned leadership team driven by the Danaher Business System create a strong foundation for continued outperformance.
I have loved every day of the past 3 decades. And throughout my entire Danaher career, I've been privileged to be part of an incredible team. I've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency, enhancing the portfolio, driving innovation and developing talent. And I can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts. I plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months, and I'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come.
Many of you know Rainer Blair well from his days as President of SCIEX and more recently is our EVP, leading the evolution of our Life Science platform, enhancing the platform's growth and margin profile, while leading the acquisitions of Pall, IDT and Cytiva, to name just a few. There is no question that Rainer is the right person to lead us into the future. With the support of our senior leadership team and our Board, I'm confident that Rainer is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our shareholders.
So what's next for me? Well, first off, that question is one for several months from now. But I'm looking forward to spending more time with my family, and I'll continue to serve on the Boards of MedStar Health and the College of the Holy Cross. I'll remain in the CEO role through September 1 of this year, and I'll be around into 2021 in an advisory role. But for now and as soon as we finish this call, we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start taking your questions."

Happy to walk you through that a bit. So let's go right to the COVID impact in Q2. And I would think about it as largely a tailwind that probably represents 500 basis points of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT. And in terms of the related question about what's spoken for, Cepheid -- we're flat out at Cepheid. We are continuing to expand our capacity, but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build.
Radiometer, also running flat out, not quite the need for expanded capacity. We had the surge capacity we needed there, but they're doing exceptionally well and IDT holding its own as well. So I think, overall, you'd consider Cepheid, Radiometer and IDT certainly contributors on the positive side. 
What that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is potentially down anywhere from 5% to 15%. And those heavier headwinds are going to come in businesses like Beckman Diagnostics, Leica Biosystems, a bit that are more patient volume-dependent, and we'll have to see whether that patient volume coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return. But certainly, the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment-oriented business, like LMS and SCIEX and a bit of PID, no doubt.
So now putting all that together, you then partially offset that with probably a bit of positive from Pall and Cytiva that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively COVID-related, but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines. So I think that's the way I'd sort of generally frame up the pluses and the minuses around the COVID impact in Q2."

It's always hard to tell when it's on the margins as to whether or not there was stocking going on there. Generally, we don't think it was particularly material. But I'd tell you, Cytiva was off to a great start. As I mentioned, 10% core growth in the first quarter, really strong momentum in the core bioprocessing business, and that's really driven by folks working on solutions to COVID-19. And -- but as we look forward, I think we have really -- as you can imagine, given we just closed the end of March, 1st of April, we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like. And there's plenty of uncertainties about how much that volume will build over time depending on the progression of therapies and vaccines. So I think we've got an outstanding start here. But in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on Cytiva, we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like. Obviously, we haven't even gotten face-to-face with the team yet from an operating review standpoint, given the limitations we have here on travel.
So right now, we're going to focus on, obviously, a good deal of re-branding work that we need to do. We're going to stand it up as a stand-alone operating company, execute on the TSA and exit those TSA work streams and costs, and make sure that we're embedding DBS into the business and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance. So we'll come back and give you a better sense of what Cytiva looks like in the balance of the year once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of how the bookings trends look, and we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year."

So this has very much been the culmination of a succession planning process that really has gone on over the last 5 or 6 years. We always want to do something like this when we're in a position of strength. And I think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance, where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what I think makes us very comfortable that this is certainly a good time to turn the reins over.
It was superimportant that we got Cytiva closed. And that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here of the role allows for both Rainer and I to contribute to ensuring that Cytiva comes into the organization smoothly. So I think it's really a combination of all those things. I think the Danaher Board was incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along. I am really excited about Rainer and the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role, and he's just going to do a fantastic job. So we all feel great about it."

There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID, and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned, both on the short-term and the long term.I think if you start with, from a diagnostic t",571,"Sure. Thanks, Tycho. There's -- we've got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of COVID, and I think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned, both on the short-term and the long term.
I think if you start with, from a diagnostic testing perspective, Cepheid's impact along with IDT, Radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as Beckman and serology and IgG testing, I think that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities.
Now you asked about the durability of the Cepheid test. I think, as you know well, we are one of the world leaders in flu testing. And I think as we see the future here, you're going to look -- clinicians are going to be looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing COVID-19 testing. And I think the ability to run those tests on the same platform and the same cartridge, obviously, with the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have for Cepheid.
Of course, as this surge in demand now is happening, we're seeing that not only in terms of the test cartridges themselves, but it's driving a significant increase in our installed base. And so as that installed base has grown, you're also going to see that installed base driving not only COVID-19 testing, but it's continuing to support expanded flu testing and market share gains for Cepheid over time. And obviously, there's a broader suite of tests that run on the Cepheid architecture, and so that's going to benefit as well. So we think there's exceptional durability to the Cepheid architecture in an environment even in one where we have, and god willing we will have, both therapies as well as vaccines.
In terms of your question about Beckman and serology, I think the way we see serology evolving over time is it's going to be primarily driven, obviously, with a blood draw. And you're going to see the serology test, the IgG test integrated into more routine testing. And therefore, the cost per test is going to be quite reasonable, and it's going to be in line with other immunoassay tests. And so while we talk about the capacity to have 30 million tests, as I think Matt said earlier, wouldn't build that into any models, but I think it's representative of the fact that serology testing, that IgG test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay. So I think a lot of terrific potential there, particularly as it relates to advances in public health and population testing. And some of the work that's being done by public health authorities to look for hotspots over time.
In terms of your question about Cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines, I'd say both Pall and Cytiva are uniquely positioned to provide pretty critical inputs, meaning filtration and resins, to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Right now, we would estimate that they're greater than 150 therapeutic and vaccine candidates today. And Pall and Cytiva are working with a majority of those in some capacity. And so obviously, there'll be winners and losers, but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with folks that are likely going to be part of the future therapy and/or vaccine answers. So I think a good spot to be in."

Well, I'd start, Vijay, with the fact that Rainer and I have worked together closely for virtually all of his 10 years. I don't know if everybody knows that when Rainer was first hired at Danaher, he came in initially as the President of Videojet. And I'm not sure Rainer and his wife, Elaine, had actually unpacked their bags when we had -- we were looking to succeed me at SCIEX after the SCIEX acquisition, I was headed off to Beckman and we had this outstanding leader who had just come into Videojet, and the real need at SCIEX, and Rainer repacked and moved to Boston and led SCIEX for a number of years, and just did an exceptional job. And he and I have worked together literally every day since then, through the work at SCIEX, through the acquisitions of Pall and IDT, obviously, throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become Cytiva, our largest acquisition ever. 
And so when you work together for as long as we have, I guess, there do tend to be quite a number of similarities about the 2 of us. But Vijay, you're going to have plenty of time to ask Rainer that question, and he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the 2 of us than I will. He's an outstanding individual, he is super smart, he is steeped in the domains, not only in life science, but across Danaher. He's unbelievably well-respected across Danaher as a DBS leader, a great teacher, a DBS practitioner and somebody who lives and breathes the Danaher core values and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day. His track record relative to M&A and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets, both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled.
So I hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the 2 of us in terms of what we value, but Rainer will put his own mark on Danaher, and I am supremely confident that, that mark on Danaher is going to be an outstanding one and an indelible one."

As far as decremental margins go, I think the place that I'd start is probably about 40% decrementals. It can vary quite a bit depending on mix, et cetera. But I think starting with 40% is a good place to start. I will tell you that probably in Q2 in Diagnostics, though, probably need to be more like 50% or 60% decrementals, and that's all related to FX.

265621,676842083,2043946,"Danaher Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2020",2020-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Danaher Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter results, especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team",2039,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter results, especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team's commitment to the Danaher Business System and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today. 
We're tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders for many years to come. 
Before we run through our second quarter results, I'd like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future.
Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of global communities' attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19, and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched, shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. As a testament to Cepheid's commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments are very different. So the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter, ahead of the upcoming flu season.
In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double digits, and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid's installed base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally, bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world.
Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter diagnostics serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity, and in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward.
As we look beyond testing, a global race is on to find effective treatments for COVID-19, and we're proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies -- therapeutics for the virus.
Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bioprocessing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster.
In addition to our market-leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva's innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall's process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster. And in one instance, accomplishing in just a few weeks what typically takes months or even years. These innovative bioprocessing solutions are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure.
Now let's look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter, just under 10%, led by our life sciences and diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenues in the developed markets was up mid-single digits, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up slightly, driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single digits year-over-year. Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down, primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both gross and operating profit margin increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year.
Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points, driven by slightly lower volume, excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense.
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment.
We're also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19.
Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8%, led by high teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations.
Demand for our bio processing, genomics and automation solutions was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatment. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems.
Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. Now despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marks SCIEX's most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation.
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 2.5%, with 5% core revenue growth, led by continued strength in our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter, further expanding Radiometer's market-leading global installed base. This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China.
At our water quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial end-market softness, while municipalities remain stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region.
Core revenue at our product identification platform was down double digits, largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well as well as we continue to support customers throughout the pandemic, helping to keep their essential business operations up and running. 
So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let's take a closer look at recent trends across our end markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough, with modest improvements as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit, albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed, with many states only recently beginning Phase 3 openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process.
Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19-related research and development among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers is generating strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use in cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise the majority of our exposure to the bioprocessing end market. And collectively, these 2 businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer-term opportunities we're seeing here.
Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID-related research lab activity. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen, but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S., while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building.
Looking across clinical diagnostics, we continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings.
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate, and we're encouraged by recent order book trends.
In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid- to high-single-digit core revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit -- low double digits, Diagnostics up high single digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat.
So to wrap up, we're proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We're excited about the portfolio that we have today, how it will continue to differentiate us going forward. And we're fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely positioned Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future.
With that, Matt, I'll turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions."

I think we're probably a little bit heavier investing there. But generally speaking, I think we're biased here in this environment to continue to try and spend to make sure that we position ourselves not only for where we are in the short term here in '20, but to make sure that as we head into 2021 that we're in the best position possible. So it might be how I think about it going forward."

We're going to continue to produce stand-alone tests as well, but there's no question our customers have expressed very strong interest in a targeted respiratory panel that brings together COVID, flu A, flu B and RSV. So we'll be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and be coming back with that. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity there.
Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You'll recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests, and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests, and we're going to -- we've released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity. Some of that capital that we released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We'll see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021.
I think key to this, Derik, is our view that there's a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables. There's plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there's no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So we're going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market."

We're not going to have dozens and dozens of winners here. I think we'll have several winners.

No. Cytiva margins did come in north of 40% in Q2, which is, obviously, like you said, better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there's 3 things to think about on the reason for that. One, we had higher volume here. North of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from a fall-through perspective, from a VCM perspective, so we did have higher volumes.
The other thing -- the second thing is there's probably a very favorable mix element here. We had sort of the higher-margin businesses like process chromatography grew double digits, while more of the equipment-heavy businesses will, call it, low single digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter.
And then the third thing is, and I think you've seen it in a lot of places, we just had a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right? Travel, trade shows, et cetera, was sort of much lower. So I think you add it all up, that's how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40%. But I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin -- think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 is sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way. But there's 2 things that I think to think about as we head forward into Q3 and the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses. We alluded to that earlier in the call. But in particular, this business, one, given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bioprocessing, and frankly, the business have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past, and we're very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity afforded to them. So that's one.
And then two, we're 90 days into this from a kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our stand-up costs, the number of people we've hired, the cost that we've put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus, that is going to ramp as we go through the second half, and that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well.
So good start, for sure, a little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm, but I do think there's some moderation coming."

Yes, we're in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet, and that position continues to be reinforced by a really exceptional free cash flow. A $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot.
When I talk about opportunistic, that's a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we were coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter. And that sometimes creates opportunities that, for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming. Businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden they have a change of heart about their future, and we're able to take advantage of that. But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see is continuing strength in that free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year. And that goes across each one of our platforms, life sciences, diagnostics, water quality and PID. Each of them continuing to focus on key market segments where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and, in some cases, bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers every day. And so I think we're in a great position. We're starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter.
One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics, in the second quarter. That was a deal that was essentially put on old earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up. But as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and were able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that's a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform. And we're looking forward to that team playing a significant role. So that's just one example. But I would say we're generally seeing an improving environment, one, that we can not only be opportunistic, but I think continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time."

And so there's no doubt that you come off of a situation like that, and I think we'll see improvement. We're already seeing a little bit of that already. I would say, normally, what happens, particularly on the back of a very large acquisition like Cytiva that we had done, you have historically seen us do more small, mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment, and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally on the back of a big deal. We tend to do a few smaller deals.
Now all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we're in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow. Certainly that Cytiva is helpful. So in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach. I mean, obviously, Cytiva was outsized, but I think we can be pretty balanced in terms of taking advantage of an improving environment."

But obviously, with the restrictions on travel and being -- and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we've had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objective in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start.
So I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year through regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We've gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. Add to that the fact that the team reports in directly to Rainer. Rainer will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he's maintained that relationship and continue to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So we've gone through what we call ECO. You've heard of that before. Executive Champion Orientation. A lot of that is very familiar to that team because they are well downfield in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. So yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that business, and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So net-net, the combination of using virtual -- our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications, along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business, we can safely say right now we're very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face-to-face environment."

And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent-up capital demand in a number of different areas. I might cite one example. If I turn to our Environmental & Applied Solutions business segment and I look at Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, you've seen -- we've seen much more weakness in our -- in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that, that equipment has a life cycle, it requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment as consumer packaged goods volumes have grown. And so I would very much expect to see that -- to use one example, that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order, I think, ditto on as labs reopened in the life science market, we're going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we've dialed some of that improvement in -- even the third quarter as we start to see labs reopening.

And then I had one less exciting model question.

And then I had one less exciting model question. There are 2 things that we focused on, on the call here, where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines. In the vaccine space, while it's certainly tough to know exactly how it's going to look and how big it's going to be, it'd be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we're at x today, which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to '21, is it still x? Or is it x times 2 or x times 3? What does that look like?
And then the other ramp-related question, I was going to ask actually relates to health care utilization. So Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting health care to some extent in doc office settings, to some extent, hospitals. That's encouraging. Should we take this to mean you feel good about -- this sort of dovetails off of Doug's question, but the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck DX and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q? Or given everything that's going on in the hospitals, that they'd take a little bit longer?"

So your broader question started out with recovery trajectory. And I want to just hit one quick theme, and I get to your question about vaccines.
One of the key things we haven't really touched on, on this call, even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory, was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across life sciences and diagnostics and not just across Cytiva and Pall, but -- or Cepheid, but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China, benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we're seeing broadly there and, across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that -- I think that's an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven't really touched on today. 
And let me get to the core of your question. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again, yes, you're right. It is. As I said earlier, it's very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean you're talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. I mean, today, all of these -- all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase I, Phase II, early-stage human trials, small volumes, et cetera. I mean we're nowhere near the stage of talking about tens of, let alone hundreds of, millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it's certainly a high multiple of where we are today, but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is.
Relative to your question about health care utilization, I think the simple answer is, yes, we will be seeing an improvement in our -- in the hardware equipment side of the house. And yes, it is associated with Beckman Diagnostics..."

But the issue has been not just around health care utilization relative to equipment, but it's really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area, whether it's the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not, in certain cases, 0. And so just as we're seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we've started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that's in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we'll start to see that return to a more normal growth rate."

We're very pleased with our second quarter results especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team'",2039,"Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter results especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team's commitment to the Danaher Business System and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today.  
We're tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders for many years to come.  
Before we run through our second quarter results, I'd like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future. Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of the global communities' attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19, and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched, shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. 
As a testament to Cepheid's commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments are very different so the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter, ahead of the upcoming flu season. 
In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double digits, and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid's installed base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally, bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world. 
Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. 
As we look beyond testing, a global race is on to find effective treatments for COVID-19, and we're proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies -- therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bioprocessing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster. 
In addition to our market-leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva's innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall's process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster and in one instance, accomplishing in just a few weeks what typically takes months or even years. These innovative bioprocessing solutions are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure. 
Now let's look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter, just under 10%, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenues in the developed markets was up mid-single digits, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up slightly, driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single digits year-over-year. 
Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down, primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both gross and operating profit margin increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points, driven by slightly lower volume excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. 
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment. We're also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8%, led by high-teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations. Demand for our bioprocessing, genomics and automation solutions was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatment. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. 
Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. But despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marks SCIEX' most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 2.5% with 5% core revenue growth, led by continued strength in our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter, further expanding Radiometer's market-leading global installed base. 
This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. 
At our water quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial end-market softness while municipalities remained stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region. 
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down double digits largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well as well as we continue to support customers throughout the pandemic, helping to keep their essential business operations up and running.  
So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let's take a closer look at recent trends across our end markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough, with modest improvements as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed with many states only recently beginning phase 3 openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process. 
Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19-related research and development among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers is generating strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise the majority of our exposure to the bioprocessing end market, and collectively, these 2 businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer-term opportunities we're seeing here. 
Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID-related research lab activity. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S. while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building. 
Looking across clinical diagnostics. We continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings. 
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate, and we're encouraged by recent order book trends. 
In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid- to high-single-digit core revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit -- low double digits, Diagnostics up high single digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat. 
So to wrap up, we're proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We're excited about the portfolio that we have today and how it will continue to differentiate us going forward, and we're fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely position Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future. 
With that, Matt, I'll turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions."

Well, we're not yet at a point where we are in a position to talk about pricing on the 4-in-1 test, but certainly, this is a test that is going to be incredibly important in the market.

Well, we're not yet at a point where we are in a position to talk about pricing on the 4-in-1 test, but certainly, this is a test that is going to be incredibly important in the market. We're going to continue to produce stand-alone tests as well, but there's no question our customers have expressed very strong interest in a targeted respiratory panel that brings together COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. So we'll be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and coming back with that. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity there. 
Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You'll recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests, and we're going to -- we've released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity. Some of that capital that we've released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We'll see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021. 
I think key to this, Derik, is our view that there's a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables. There's plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there's no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So we're going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market."

Obviously, we haven't developed the pricing model yet, and we're building capacity.

I think there was an outsized impact certainly at Cepheid during the course of the second quarter with that instrument volume boosting at the rate that it did. We don't expect that, that necessarily will continue to grow quite at that rate, so I think that's one mitigating factor. 
And I think -- as it relates to both Pall Biotech and Cytiva, I think we'll see continued traction there, but at the moment, we think that what we're seeing from customers is a demand that is -- again, given the quick ramp that was associated with the 200-or-so vaccine- and therapeutic-related efforts that are going on, that those are likely to be more consistent in the third quarter rather than differentially higher. So those are just some of the factors. Perhaps that's a little bit conservative. If so, we'll take that. But in line, that's our best estimate at the moment."

But I mean, I think if you think about what we're going to be doing here in the fourth quarter and into '21, particularly around the build-out on Cytiva and if you think about our tailwinds, the build-out in Cytiva -- sorry, the build-out on Cepheid capacity that's coming online and then probably as importantly, we had 40% growth in orders at both Cytiva and Pall Biotech here in the quarter. And while we don't expect all of that to show up here in Q3, that does portend well for what we think the second half will sort of look like and as we head into '21. 
And that was not just on vaccines, but that was sort of kind of evenly split between vaccines and the therapeutics, which you know are a big part, too. So while we may have a more modest expectation for the third quarter, I think that there's a ramp as we head through the second half and in particular to '21."

Cytiva margins did come in north of 40% in Q2, which is obviously, like you said, better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there's 3 things to think about on the reason for that. One, we had higher volume here. North of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from a fall-through perspective, from a VCM perspective so we did have higher volumes.
The other thing -- the second thing is there's probably a very favorable mix element here. We had -- sort of the higher-margin businesses like process chromatography grew double digits while more of the equipment-heavy businesses were, call it, low single digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter. And then the third thing is, and I think you've seen it in a lot of places, we just had a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right? Travel, trade shows, et cetera, was sort of much lower. So I think if you add it all up, that's how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40%. 
But I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin -- think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 is sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way. But there's 2 things that I think -- to think about as we head forward into Q3 and the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses, we alluded to that earlier in the call, but in particular, this business, one -- given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bioprocessing. And frankly, [ it's not ] a business that have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past, and we're very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity afforded to them. So that's one.
And then two, we're 90 days into this, from kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our stand-up costs, the number of people we've hired, the costs that we've put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus, that is going to ramp as we go through the second half, and that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well. So good start for sure, a little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm, but I do think there's some moderation coming."

Yes, we're in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet, and that position continues to be reinforced by a really exceptional free cash flow. A $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot.
When I talk about opportunistic, that's a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we were coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter. And that sometimes creates opportunities that, for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming, businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden they have a change of heart about their future and we're able to take advantage of that. 
But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see as continuing strength in that free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year. And that goes across each one of our platforms, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, water quality and PID, each of them continuing to focus on key market segments where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and, in some cases, bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers every day. 
And so I think we're in a great position. We're starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter. One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics, in the second quarter. That was a deal that was essentially put on hold earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up, but as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and were able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that's a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform, and we're looking forward to that team playing a significant role. 
So that's just one example. But I would say we're generally seeing an improving environment, one that we can not only be opportunistic but I think continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time."

And so there's no doubt that you come off of a situation like that and I think we'll see improvement. We're already seeing a little bit of that already. 
I would say, normally, what happens particularly on the back of a very large acquisition like Cytiva that we had done, you have historically seen us do more small, mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment, and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally on the back of a big deal, we tend to do a few smaller deals.
Now all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we're in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow. Certainly, Cytiva is helpful. So in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach.

Obviously, you talk about standing it up as kind of a decentralized business. But how do you do it? And is it at all -- delayed at all and you don't want to kind of disrupt the business flow right now given how high the growth rates are? Or has it already begun and you're really -- it's a similar playbook as maybe your past acquisitions?"

Scott, we have had to -- we certainly had to be creative in this environment, and I think we've been able to do that. I'll describe what I mean by that here in a minute. But obviously, with the restrictions on travel and being -- and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we've had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objectives in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start.
So I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year through regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We've gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. 
Add to that the fact that the team reports in directly to Rainer. Rainer  will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he's maintained that relationship and continued to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So we've gone through what we call ECO. You've heard of that before, executive champion orientation. A lot of that is very familiar to that team because they are well downfield in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. 
So yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that business, and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So net-net, the combination of using virtual -- our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications, along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business, we can safely say right now we're very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face-to-face environment."

And yet, as we come into this year, they came in with a strong order book, good backlog, and then you had the COVID impact on top of that. 
And so when you then kind of separate that, you see there what you might say their non-COVID base business growth being in the mid-teens and the COVID volume obviously taking that volume growth over 20%. So I think the key message there is this is a business as a base business, put COVID aside for a second, that is off to a phenomenal start, that continues to lead in its market and is continuing to build the order book day in and day out."

So I'm going to hit that assuming we didn't miss anything at the front end, which is really around -- you were talking about consumables and service versus equipment, my prepared remarks and you were asking about pent-up capital demand. And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent-up capital demand in a number of different areas. 
I might cite one example. If I turn to our Environmental & Applied Solutions business segment and I look at Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, you've seen -- we've seen much more weakness in our -- in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that, that equipment has a life cycle, it requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment as consumer packaged goods volumes have grown. And so I would very much expect to see that -- to use one example, that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order. 
I think ditto on as labs reopened in the life science market, we're going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we've dialed some of that improvement in -- even in the third quarter. As we start to see labs reopening, we're going to see some of those orders that would have normally flowed through in the first and second quarter come through in the third."

And then I had one less exciting model question. There are 2 things that we focused on, on the call here, where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines. 
In the vaccine space, while it's certainly tough to know exactly how it's going to look and how big it's going to be, it'd be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we're at X today, which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to '21, is it still X? Or is it X times 2 or X times 3? What does that look like?
And then the other ramp-related question I was going to ask actually relates to health care utilization. So Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting health care, to some extent, in doc office settings; to some extent, in hospitals. That's encouraging. Should we take this to mean you feel good about -- this sort of dovetails off of Doug's question. But the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck Dx and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q? Or given everything that's going on in the hospitals, that should take a little bit longer?"

So your broader question started out with recovery trajectory. And I want to just hit one quick theme, and then I'm going to get to your question about vaccines.
One of the key things we haven't really touched on, on this call even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across Life Sciences and Diagnostics and not just across Cytiva and Pall but -- or Cepheid but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China, benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we're seeing broadly there and, across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that -- I think that's an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven't really touched on today. 
But let me get to the core of your question. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again -- yes, you're right, it is. As I said earlier, it's very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean, you're talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. 
I mean today, all of these -- all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase I, Phase II, early-stage human trials, small volumes, et cetera. I mean we're nowhere near the stage of talking about tens of, let alone hundreds of millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it's certainly a high multiple of where we are today but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is.
Relative to your question about health care utilization, I think the simple answer is yes, we will be seeing an improvement in our -- in the hardware equipment side of the house. And yes, it is associated with Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems..."

A brief musical interlude. Maybe that was associated with the recovery in health care utilization. But the issue has been not just around health care utilization relative to equipment, but it's really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area, whether it's the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not, in certain cases, 0. 
And so just as we're seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we've started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that's in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we'll start to see that return to a more normal growth rate."

We're very pleased with our second quarter results especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team's commitment to the Danaher Business System and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today.  
We're tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders for many years to come.  
Before we run through our second quarter results, I'd like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future. Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of the global communities' attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19, and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched, shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. 
As a testament to Cepheid's commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments are very different so the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter, ahead of the upcoming flu season. 
In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double digits, and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid's installed base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally, bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world. 
Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. 
As we look beyond testing, a global race is on to find effective treatments for COVID-19, and we're proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies -- therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bioprocessing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster. 
In addition to our market-leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva's innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall's process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster and in one instance, accomplishing in just a few weeks what typically takes months or even years. These innovative bioprocessing solutions are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure. 
Now let's look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter, just under 10%, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenues in the developed markets was up mid-single digits, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up slightly, driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single digits year-over-year. 
Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down, primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both gross and operating profit margin increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points, driven by slightly lower volume excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. 
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment. We're also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8%, led by high-teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations. Demand for our bioprocessing, genomics and automation solutions was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatment. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. 
Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. But despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marks SCIEX' most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 2.5% with 5% core revenue growth, led by continued strength in our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter, further expanding Radiometer's market-leading global installed base. 
This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. 
At our water quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial end-market softness while municipalities remained stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region. 
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down double digits largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well as well as we continue to support customers throughout the pandemic, helping to keep their essential business operations up and running.  
So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let's take a closer look at recent trends across our end markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough, with modest improvements as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed with many states only recently beginning phase 3 openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process. 
Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19-related research and development among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers is generating strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise the majority of our exposure to the bioprocessing end market, and collectively, these 2 businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer-term opportunities we're seeing here. 
Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID-related research lab activity. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S. while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building. 
Looking across clinical diagnostics. We continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings. 
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate, and we're encouraged by recent order book trends. 
In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid- to high-single-digit core revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit -- low double digits, Diagnostics up high single digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat. 
So to wrap up, we're proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We're excited about the portfolio that we have today and how it will continue to differentiate us going forward, and we're fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely position Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future. 
With that, Matt, I'll turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions."

I think we're probably a little bit heavier investing there. 
But generally speaking, I think we're biased here in this environment to continue to try and spend to make sure that we position ourselves not only for where we are in the short term here in '20 but to make sure that as we head into 2021 that we're in the best position possible. So it might be how I think about it going forward."

We're going to continue to produce stand-alone tests as well, but there's no question our customers have expressed very strong interest in a targeted respiratory panel that brings together COVID, Flu A, Flu B and RSV. So we'll be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and coming back with that. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity there. 
Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You'll recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests, and we're going to -- we've released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity. Some of that capital that we've released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We'll see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021. 
I think key to this, Derik, is our view that there's a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables. There's plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there's no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So we're going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market."

And I think -- as it relates to both Pall Biotech and Cytiva, I think we'll see continued traction there, but at the moment, we think that what we're seeing from customers is a demand that is -- again, given the quick ramp that was associated with the 200-or-so vaccine- and therapeutic-related efforts that are going on, that those are likely to be more consistent in the third quarter rather than differentially higher.

I think there's 3 things to think about on the reason for that. One, we had higher volume",463,"Yes, sure. Cytiva margins did come in north of 40% in Q2, which is obviously, like you said, better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there's 3 things to think about on the reason for that. One, we had higher volume here. North of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from a fall-through perspective, from a VCM perspective so we did have higher volumes.
The other thing -- the second thing is there's probably a very favorable mix element here. We had -- sort of the higher-margin businesses like process chromatography grew double digits while more of the equipment-heavy businesses were, call it, low single digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter. And then the third thing is, and I think you've seen it in a lot of places, we just had a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right? Travel, trade shows, et cetera, was sort of much lower. So I think if you add it all up, that's how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40%. 
But I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin -- think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 is sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way. But there's 2 things that I think -- to think about as we head forward into Q3 and the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses, we alluded to that earlier in the call, but in particular, this business, one -- given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bioprocessing. And frankly, [ it's not ] a business that have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past, and we're very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity afforded to them. So that's one.
And then two, we're 90 days into this, from kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our stand-up costs, the number of people we've hired, the costs that we've put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus, that is going to ramp as we go through the second half, and that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well. So good start for sure, a little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm, but I do think there's some moderation coming."

Yes, we're in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet, and that position continues to be reinforced by a really exceptional free cash flow. A $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot.
When I talk about opportunistic, that's a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we were coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter. And that sometimes creates opportunities that, for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming, businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden they have a change of heart about their future and we're able to take advantage of that. 
But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see as continuing strength in that free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year. And that goes across each one of our platforms, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, water quality and PID, each of them continuing to focus on key market segments where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and, in some cases, bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers every day. 
And so I think we're in a great position. We're starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter. One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics, in the second quarter. That was a deal that was essentially put on hold earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up, but as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and were able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that's a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform, and we're looking forward to that team playing a significant role. 
So that's just one example. But I would say we're generally seeing an improving environment, one that we can not only be opportunistic but I think continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time."

Well, first of all, Scott, I think, over the next 12 months, I think we'll see, without any question, an improving environment from an M&A and capital deployment perspective. I mean we all know that March, April probably -- I mean things were essentially locked down. And to a great extent, people were frozen in place in many different ways. And so there's no doubt that you come off of a situation like that and I think we'll see improvement. We're already seeing a little bit of that already. 
I would say, normally, what happens particularly on the back of a very large acquisition like Cytiva that we had done, you have historically seen us do more small, mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment, and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally on the back of a big deal, we tend to do a few smaller deals.
Now all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we're in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow. Certainly, Cytiva is helpful. So in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach. I mean, obviously, Cytiva was outsized, but I think we can be pretty balanced in terms of taking advantage of an improving environment."

But obviously, with the restrictions on travel and being -- and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we've had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objectives in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start.
So I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year through regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We've gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. 
Add to that the fact that the team reports in directly to Rainer. Rainer  will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he's maintained that relationship and continued to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So we've gone through what we call ECO. You've heard of that before, executive champion orientation. A lot of that is very familiar to that team because they are well downfield in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. 
So yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that business, and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So net-net, the combination of using virtual -- our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications, along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business, we can safely say right now we're very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face-to-face environment."

So I'm going to hit that assuming we didn't miss anything at the front end, which is really around -- you were talking about consumables and service versus equipment, my prepared remarks and you were asking about pent-up capital demand. And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent-up capital demand in a number of different areas. 
I might cite one example. If I turn to our Environmental & Applied Solutions business segment and I look at Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, you've seen -- we've seen much more weakness in our -- in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that, that equipment has a life cycle, it requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment as consumer packaged goods volumes have grown. And so I would very much expect to see that -- to use one example, that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order. 
I think ditto on as labs reopened in the life science market, we're going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we've dialed some of that improvement in -- even in the third quarter. As we start to see labs reopening, we're going to see some of those orders that would have normally flowed through in the first and second quarter come through in the third."

And then I had one less exciting model question. There are 2 things that we focused on, on the call here, where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines. 
In the vaccine space, while it's certainly tough to know exactly how it's going to look and how big it's going to be, it'd be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we're at X today, which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to '21, is it still X? Or is it X times 2 or X times 3? What does that look like?
And then the other ramp-related question I was going to ask actually relates to health care utilization. So Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting health care, to some extent, in doc office settings; to some extent, in hospitals. That's encouraging. Should we take this to mean you feel good about -- this sort of dovetails off of Doug's question. But the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck Dx and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q? Or given everything that's going on in the hospitals, that should take a little bit longer?"

So your broader question started out with recovery trajectory. And I want to just hit one quick theme, and then I'm going to get to your question about vaccines.
One of the key things we haven't really touched on, on this call even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across Life Sciences and Diagnostics and not just across Cytiva and Pall but -- or Cepheid but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China, benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we're seeing broadly there and, across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that -- I think that's an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven't really touched on today. 
But let me get to the core of your question. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again -- yes, you're right, it is. As I said earlier, it's very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean, you're talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. 
I mean today, all of these -- all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase I, Phase II, early-stage human trials, small volumes, et cetera. I mean we're nowhere near the stage of talking about tens of, let alone hundreds of millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it's certainly a high multiple of where we are today but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is.

A brief musical interlude. Maybe that was associated with the recovery in health care utilization. But the issue has been not just around health care utilization relative to equipment, but it's really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area, whether it's the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not, in certain cases, 0. 
And so just as we're seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we've started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that's in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we'll start to see that return to a more normal growth rate."

We're very pleased with our second quarter results especially in such a challenging environment.

We're very pleased with our second quarter results especially in such a challenging environment. Our solid core revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and more than 30% EPS growth are a testament to our team's commitment to the Danaher Business System and the outstanding portfolio of businesses that comprise Danaher today.  
We're tackling the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic head on and are fortunate to do so from a position of strength. These circumstances have showcased the resilience of our portfolio, a unique collection of market-leading franchises and technologies with a high level of recurring revenue and a foundation of continuous improvement. We believe that this powerful combination differentiates Danaher and will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders for many years to come.  
Before we run through our second quarter results, I'd like to provide an update on a few of the ways we are directly contributing to the fight against COVID-19 today and well into the future. Diagnostic testing has been a critical component of the global communities' attempts to better understand and ultimately curb the spread of COVID-19, and Cepheid has been a leader in this effort. In March, Cepheid launched the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 that provides highly accurate results within 45 minutes. Multiple independent studies indicate that Cepheid's test performance is best in class versus other point-of-care platforms on the market today, providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results. The team has meaningfully increased production capacity since the test was launched, shipping more than 6 million test cartridges in the second quarter. 
As a testament to Cepheid's commitment to tackle this global health crisis, the team recently announced the development of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments are very different so the test is being designed to provide critical answers within 35 minutes to ensure the best patient outcome. The 4-in-1 test is expected to launch in the third quarter, ahead of the upcoming flu season. 
In addition to ramping test production, Cepheid also delivered a record number of new instruments to customers in the second quarter. The installed base grew double digits, and the number of new instrument placements was more than 4x that of a typical quarter. This significantly increases Cepheid's installed base, which now totals more than 26,000 instruments globally, bringing essential diagnostic information closer to more patients and communities around the world. 
Another addition to our diagnostic testing capabilities was the launch of Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' serology test in June. This highly sensitive and specific assay can identify IgG antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop within the first 14 days of infection. Antibody assays could potentially play an important role in understanding immunity and, in turn, improving the world's ability to manage COVID-19 going forward. 
As we look beyond testing, a global race is on to find effective treatments for COVID-19, and we're proud to support the scientific community in their pursuit of new vaccines and therapies -- therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 200 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway around the world, including participation on every COVID-19 vaccine that is in human clinical trials today. Our unique offering across the bioprocessing workflow positions us exceptionally well to help bring vaccines and therapies to market faster. 
In addition to our market-leading filtration, chromatography and single-use technologies, Pall and Cytiva's innovative teams provide customers with extensive technical expertise to enable breakthrough development and production capabilities. One such example is Pall's process development services team, which is helping customers scale up their vaccine production processes significantly faster and in one instance, accomplishing in just a few weeks what typically takes months or even years. These innovative bioprocessing solutions are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate the pursuit of COVID-19 prevention and ultimately a cure. 
Now let's look at our second quarter results. We generated $5.3 billion sales with 3.5% core revenue growth. The impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by 2%. We also saw strong order growth in the quarter, just under 10%, led by our Life Sciences and Diagnostics platforms. Geographically, revenues in the developed markets was up mid-single digits, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up slightly, driven by a meaningful sequential improvement in China, which was up low single digits year-over-year. 
Gross profit margin of 53.8% and operating profit margin of 15.9% were both down, primarily as a result of fair value adjustments related to the Cytiva acquisition. Excluding these adjustments, both gross and operating profit margin increased by more than 150 basis points year-over-year. Core operating profit margin was down 80 basis points, driven by slightly lower volume excluding Cytiva, foreign exchange rate movements and higher corporate expense. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.44 were up 32% versus last year. 
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2 billion year-to-date, both up approximately 35% or more year-over-year. Our outstanding free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities in this environment. We're also accelerating growth investments across Danaher, most notably at Cepheid and many of our life science businesses, where we are expanding production capacity to support the fight against COVID-19. 
Now let's take a more detailed look at results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 8%, led by high-teens or better core growth at Cytiva, Pall Biotech and IDT. More specifically, Cytiva achieved more than 20% core revenue growth in its first full quarter as part of Danaher, exceeding our expectations. Demand for our bioprocessing, genomics and automation solutions was driven by ongoing global efforts to develop COVID-19 testing and treatment. This was partially offset by declines in our more instrument-oriented businesses, SCIEX and Leica Microsystems. 
Academic and research lab closures delayed installations of existing instrument orders and new capital purchases, particularly across developed markets. But despite this difficult environment, SCIEX successfully launched multiple new products earlier this month, including the Triple Quad 7500 mass spectrometer. The new 7500 marks SCIEX' most significant launch of the last 5 years and reinforces their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry. This is another great example of how we're continuing to invest for growth across Danaher and enhancing our competitive advantage through innovation. 
Moving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 2.5% with 5% core revenue growth, led by continued strength in our point-of-care businesses, Cepheid and Radiometer. Global demand for Cepheid's COVID-19 tests and GeneXpert instruments helped drive more than 100% core revenue growth at Cepheid in the quarter. Radiometer delivered double-digit core revenue growth as elevated levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations drove demand for blood gas testing. A record number of new ABL blood gas analyzers were delivered during the quarter, further expanding Radiometer's market-leading global installed base. 
This strong performance was partially offset by declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems, our core laboratory and pathology businesses. Patient volumes were down meaningfully as elective procedures and wellness visits resumed slowly throughout the quarter, particularly across the U.S. and Europe. This was partially offset by improvements in China, where hospital visits began to approach pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was down 10.5% and core revenue declined 8.5%. By geography, declines in North America and Western Europe were partially offset by double-digit growth in China. 
At our water quality platform, mid-single-digit core revenue declines were driven by industrial end-market softness while municipalities remained stable. Steady demand for our consumables and chemistries globally was offset by delayed equipment purchases, particularly in the developed markets. However, we were encouraged by strong results in China during the quarter as activity returned to more normalized levels across the region. 
Core revenue at our Product Identification platform was down double digits largely due to equipment revenue decline as mission-critical operating expenses were prioritized over larger capital investments. At Videojet, positive consumables growth was led by demand across the consumer packaged goods and food end markets. Service performed well as well as we continue to support customers throughout the pandemic, helping to keep their essential business operations up and running.  
So with that as a context for what we saw by segment, let's take a closer look at recent trends across our end markets. Encouragingly, the dynamics of the quarter were largely a continuation of what we outlined in early May. April appeared to be the trough, with modest improvements as we move through May and June. Geographically, we continue to see improving activity in China, with Europe following suit albeit at a slower pace. Resumption of activity in the U.S. is mixed with many states only recently beginning phase 3 openings and others experiencing setbacks in the process. 
Within Life Sciences, we continue to see a bifurcation across our end markets. The recent surge in COVID-19-related research and development among our biotech and pharmaceutical customers is generating strong demand for our bioprocessing, genomic and automation solutions. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity also remains very healthy, contributing to demand for filtration, chromatography, single-use and cell and gene therapy products. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise the majority of our exposure to the bioprocessing end market, and collectively, these 2 businesses had more than 40% growth in their order book in the quarter, a strong indication of the longer-term opportunities we're seeing here. 
Meanwhile, widespread shutdowns continue to impact non-COVID-related research lab activity. Labs in the U.S. recently started to reopen but are operating at limited capacity and with distinct variations by region. The story in Europe is similar to the U.S. while China is further along and activity appears to be approaching pre-pandemic levels. We estimate that approximately 50% to 60% of academic research labs in developed markets are now open in some capacity. That number is closer to 90% in China, where installations have resumed and instrument order books are building. 
Looking across clinical diagnostics. We continue to see very strong demand for molecular point-of-care and acute care testing, which is also driving a significant increase in instrument placements globally. Across hospital labs and reference labs, we were encouraged to see patient volumes ramp up as we move through the quarter, with elective procedures and wellness checks resuming across much of the developed markets. Today, we estimate that patient volumes in North America are approximately 85% to 90% of historical levels, with Europe slightly ahead and China even further along given their earlier reopenings. 
In the applied markets, the divergence of demand between consumables and equipment appears to be lessening. Consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods, food and medicine. Equipment declines are starting to moderate, and we're encouraged by recent order book trends. 
In light of these recent dynamics, we expect to deliver mid- to high-single-digit core revenue growth in the third quarter. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the second quarter. By segment, we expect core revenue growth at Life Sciences to be up double-digit -- low double digits, Diagnostics up high single digits and Environmental & Applied Solutions to be approximately flat. 
So to wrap up, we're proud of our results this quarter. Our team stayed focused on executing and continued to find innovative ways to tackle the challenges and opportunities presented by this pandemic. We're excited about the portfolio that we have today and how it will continue to differentiate us going forward, and we're fortunate to navigate through this environment from a position of strength, with our solid balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation enabling us to be nimble and opportunistic. We believe that the combination of our talented team, DBS-driven execution and resilient portfolio uniquely position Danaher to outperform in 2020 and well into the future. 
With that, Matt, I'll turn the call back over to you so that we can start taking questions."

I think we're probably a little bit heavier investing there. 
But generally speaking, I think we're biased here in this environment to continue to try and spend to make sure that we position ourselves not only for where we are in the short term here in '20 but to make sure that as we head into 2021 that we're in the best position possible. So it might be how I think about it going forward."

So we'll be sizing up the opportunities relative to pricing over the next several weeks and coming back with that. So we think there's a tremendous opportunity there. 
Relative to Cepheid capacity, we continue to build on our output capabilities. You'll recall, in the first quarter, I think we were at about 2 million tests and we were just ramping. We ramped well throughout the course of the quarter to 6 million tests, and we're going to -- we've released a significant amount of capital to continue to build that capacity. Some of that capital that we've released is going to take a little bit of time to come online. We'll see some modest growth in the third quarter here and even more significant growth as we go into the fourth quarter and then certainly throughout 2021. 
I think key to this, Derik, is our view that there's a tremendous amount of durability and sustainability to the testing benefits that Cepheid delivers to the market. Certainly, there is a lot of variables. There's plenty of competition. But when you look at the speed and the accuracy that we deliver and the value that we deliver associated with the diagnosis, there's no doubt that, that demand is going to be sustained over time. So we're going to continue to ramp that capacity and sustain our strong positions in the market."

So I think your question was how much volume is going to move to the 4-in-1. We do not know the answer to that at this point. It's -- we believe it will be significant and material, but in terms of putting a number on it quite yet, we just don't have enough voice of customer yet. 
Obviously, we haven't developed the pricing model yet, and we're building capacity. So we'll have to come back to you probably in the next couple of months with a better sense of how we see that volume ramping. Again, we'll continue to produce the stand-alone tests so there'll be a balance there. Time will tell on the overall volume. 
So let's try the earlier part of your question again."

I think there was an outsized impact certainly at Cepheid during the course of the second quarter with that instrument volume boosting at the rate that it did. We don't expect that, that necessarily will continue to grow quite at that rate, so I think that's one mitigating factor. 
And I think -- as it relates to both Pall Biotech and Cytiva, I think we'll see continued traction there, but at the moment, we think that what we're seeing from customers is a demand that is -- again, given the quick ramp that was associated with the 200-or-so vaccine- and therapeutic-related efforts that are going on, that those are likely to be more consistent in the third quarter rather than differentially higher. So those are just some of the factors. Perhaps that's a little bit conservative. If so, we'll take that. But in line, that's our best estimate at the moment."

But I mean I think if you think about what we're going to be doing here in the fourth quarter and into '21, particularly around the build-out on Cytiva and if you think about our tailwinds, the build-out in Cytiva -- sorry, the build-out on Cepheid capacity that's coming online and then probably as importantly, we had 40% growth in orders at both Cytiva and Pall Biotech here in the quarter. And while we don't expect all of that to show up here in Q3, that does portend well for what we think the second half will sort of look like and as we head into '21. 
And that was not just on vaccines, but that was sort of kind of evenly split between vaccines and the therapeutics, which you know are a big part, too. So while we may have a more modest expectation for the third quarter, I think that there's a ramp as we head through the second half and in particular to '21."

Cytiva margins did come in north of 40% in Q2, which is obviously, like you said, better than sort of the recent performance that we had seen out of them. I think there's 3 things to think about on the reason for that. One, we had higher volume here. North of 20% core growth does give you lots of opportunities from a fall-through perspective, from a VCM perspective so we did have higher volumes.
The other thing -- the second thing is there's probably a very favorable mix element here. We had -- sort of the higher-margin businesses like process chromatography grew double digits while more of the equipment-heavy businesses were, call it, low single digits, which was kind of a very favorable mix impact in the quarter. And then the third thing is, and I think you've seen it in a lot of places, we just had a lot lower OpEx spend given the stay-at-home orders, right? Travel, trade shows, et cetera, was sort of much lower. So I think if you add it all up, that's how we sort of went from where we thought it would be to sort of north of 40%. 
But I would sort of maybe temper some expectations here as we head into margin -- think about the margins in Q3. Like I said, Q2 is sort of a perfect storm with everything going the right way. But there's 2 things that I think -- to think about as we head forward into Q3 and the second half. One is this is a business that we are going to accelerate the growth investments in, not unlike we have done with our other businesses, we alluded to that earlier in the call, but in particular, this business, one -- given the plethora of growth opportunities that are out there and across all of their businesses, not just bioprocessing. And frankly, [ it's not ] a business that have got to invest as much as it would have liked maybe in the past, and we're very eager to make sure that they have every opportunity afforded to them. So that's one.
And then two, we're 90 days into this, from kind of standing it up on its own, if you will. And so our stand-up costs, the number of people we've hired, the costs that we've put into the business so far to get it stood up and off of sort of the GE kind of apparatus, that is going to ramp as we go through the second half, and that will have an impact here on the margin profile as well. So good start for sure, a little bit better than we thought on a perfect storm, but I do think there's some moderation coming."

Yes, we're in a very strong and fortunate position relative to our balance sheet, and that position continues to be reinforced by a really exceptional free cash flow. A $2 billion cash flow number on a year-to-date basis really continues to put us in a great spot.
When I talk about opportunistic, that's a term that we would typically use associated with a very uncertain sort of disrupted environment like we were coming through in the first quarter and continue to see in the second quarter. And that sometimes creates opportunities that, for whatever reason, we may not have seen coming, businesses that get into a spot where all of a sudden they have a change of heart about their future and we're able to take advantage of that. 
But with the strength of the balance sheet that we have now on the back of the equity offering that we did, the strength of the free cash flow here in the second quarter and what we see as continuing strength in that free cash flow in the third and fourth quarters, that positions us to really continue to work hard on the strategic opportunities that we focus on consistently throughout the course of the year. And that goes across each one of our platforms, Life Sciences, Diagnostics, water quality and PID, each of them continuing to focus on key market segments where there are unique opportunities, key product and technology opportunities where we can complement the strength of our existing portfolio and, in some cases, bring on a unique and differentiating leg of the portfolio that allows us to add greater value to customers every day. 
And so I think we're in a great position. We're starting to see some improvement in the environment in the second quarter. One example of that is a deal that we did for our water quality platform, Aqua Informatics, in the second quarter. That was a deal that was essentially put on hold earlier in the first quarter as things tightened up, but as things started to improve, we were able to reengage and were able to consummate that acquisition in the second quarter. And that's a tremendous add of a key data management and software capability for our water quality platform, and we're looking forward to that team playing a significant role. 
So that's just one example. But I would say we're generally seeing an improving environment, one that we can not only be opportunistic but I think continue to drive to our strategic objectives at the same time."

And so there's no doubt that you come off of a situation like that and I think we'll see improvement. We're already seeing a little bit of that already. 
I would say, normally, what happens particularly on the back of a very large acquisition like Cytiva that we had done, you have historically seen us do more small, mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions to our platforms. And I know the teams are working actively on those. Some of those smaller situations can get a little unhinged here in an uncertain environment, and that tends to serve us well. But also in terms of just the way we manage our resources internally on the back of a big deal, we tend to do a few smaller deals.
Now all that being said, when the balance sheet is as reinforced as it is right now, we're in much better shape than we might have been had we not done the equity offering and had the tremendous advantage of the current free cash flow. Certainly, Cytiva is helpful. So in general, I think we can be pretty balanced in our approach.

But obviously, with the restrictions on travel and being -- and what would normally be very much a face-to-face environment with a newly acquired business, particularly a new one, we've had to come up with new and different approaches to achieve the same objectives in the early going around DBS orientation and getting a business off to a great start.
So I think this all starts with the fact that the Cytiva business brings with it to Danaher really an exceptional team of people. We got to know them unbelievably well during diligence. Certainly, we had a whole year through regulatory approvals to get to know one another. We've gotten a sense of their command of the business, their ability to drive performance, their focus on continuous improvement, the level of humility they bring, all of which sets up for a team and a business that adapts very rapidly to a Danaher environment because they are so culturally like us right at the outset. 
Add to that the fact that the team reports in directly to Rainer. Rainer  will continue to have that team report directly into him. And he's maintained that relationship and continued to build those relationships and bring the tools and processes to that team on a virtual basis. So we've gone through what we call ECO. You've heard of that before, executive champion orientation. A lot of that is very familiar to that team because they are well downfield in a number of the tools and processes of DBS. 
So yes, we also have some of our teammates going into that business, and that obviously further accelerates the DBS orientation. So net-net, the combination of using virtual -- our electronic and digital tools to conduct DBS training and orientation and communications, along with having an outstanding team already, plus some folks from Danaher going into that business, we can safely say right now we're very much on track to where we would like to have been if we were in a face-to-face environment."

They're off to a start that is better than what we anticipated in the growth model. You heard us talk to numbers that were in the 10% range. And that core growth in 2019, if you go back to that, was about in that range. And yet, as we come into this year, they came in with a strong order book, good backlog, and then you had the COVID impact on top of that. 
And so when you then kind of separate that, you see there what you might say their non-COVID base business growth being in the mid-teens and the COVID volume obviously taking that volume growth over 20%. So I think the key message there is this is a business as a base business, put COVID aside for a second, that is off to a phenomenal start, that continues to lead in its market and is continuing to build the order book day in and day out."

So I'm going to hit that assuming we didn't miss anything at the front end, which is really around -- you were talking about consumables and service versus equipment, my prepared remarks and you were asking about pent-up capital demand. And I think the simple answer to that question is, yes, there will absolutely be some pent-up capital demand in a number of different areas. 
I might cite one example. If I turn to our Environmental & Applied Solutions business segment and I look at Videojet in PID, while you have our consumables business tracking really well, you've seen -- we've seen much more weakness in our -- in the equipment side of Videojet. But we know over a long period of time that, that equipment has a life cycle, it requires replacement, it requires a certain level of maintenance. You certainly had an expanded utilization of much of that equipment as consumer packaged goods volumes have grown. And so I would very much expect to see that -- to use one example, that Videojet equipment start to track back in short order. 
I think ditto on as labs reopened in the life science market, we're going to see some improvement there. And in fact, we've dialed some of that improvement in -- even in the third quarter. As we start to see labs reopening, we're going to see some of those orders that would have normally flowed through in the first and second quarter come through in the third."

And then I had one less exciting model question. There are 2 things that we focused on, on the call here, where we have good reason to be at least directionally optimistic about how things evolve. One is vaccines. 
In the vaccine space, while it's certainly tough to know exactly how it's going to look and how big it's going to be, it'd be really helpful if you could just give us a little perspective on what the slope of the curve looks like. If we're at X today, which is a sort of preliminary investment in scaling up in anticipation of vaccines, when we get out to '21, is it still X? Or is it X times 2 or X times 3? What does that look like?
And then the other ramp-related question I was going to ask actually relates to health care utilization. So Tom, you gave some really helpful commentary on how people are getting back to getting health care, to some extent, in doc office settings; to some extent, in hospitals. That's encouraging. Should we take this to mean you feel good about -- this sort of dovetails off of Doug's question. But the ramp for hardware spend on some of the Beck Dx and Leica products that might have been under a little bit of pressure in 2Q, do we get that back starting in 3Q? Or given everything that's going on in the hospitals, that should take a little bit longer?"

So your broader question started out with recovery trajectory. And I want to just hit one quick theme, and then I'm going to get to your question about vaccines.
One of the key things we haven't really touched on, on this call even though I mentioned it in my prepared remarks on the recovery trajectory was China. We saw a significant improvement in our China business over the course of the second quarter. And if you looked at that, the breadth of that improvement that span not just across Life Sciences and Diagnostics and not just across Cytiva and Pall but -- or Cepheid but our other businesses like Beck LS and LMS, our EAS businesses like Hach and Videojet, all performed extremely well in China, benefited from the kind of trajectory of recovery that we're seeing broadly there and, across the board, delivered positive low single-digit growth in China in the second quarter. So that -- I think that's an important dynamic of this recovery trajectory that we haven't really touched on today. 
But let me get to the core of your question. In terms of the vaccine multiples, again -- yes, you're right, it is. As I said earlier, it's very hard to gauge. But at this point, I mean, you're talking about a really high multiple of volume versus today. Let me give you an example. 
I mean today, all of these -- all of our revenues associated with this are in the early stages of Phase I, Phase II, early-stage human trials, small volumes, et cetera. I mean we're nowhere near the stage of talking about tens of, let alone hundreds of millions of doses of either a vaccine or a therapy. And so again, hard to put a number on it, but I can only say it's certainly a high multiple of where we are today but with a lot of variables attached to how high that number is.
Relative to your question about health care utilization, I think the simple answer is yes, we will be seeing an improvement in our -- in the hardware equipment side of the house. And yes, it is associated with Beckman Diagnostics and Leica Biosystems..."

A brief musical interlude. Maybe that was associated with the recovery in health care utilization. But the issue has been not just around health care utilization relative to equipment, but it's really been about the fact that in a COVID-19 environment, access to hospitals in any area, whether it's the reference lab area, anatomical pathology, microbiology, access to those labs for hardware installations has been limited, if not, in certain cases, 0. 
And so just as we're seeing academic and research labs opening up on the life science side, as we've started to see hospitals opening up a bit relative to elective procedures and overall utilization, we are now starting to see our ability to get in and install equipment that's in the order book come along. So we will see some improvement there. It will take some time for that to happen because hospitals are still highly restricted in their access. But as we go into late this year and early next year, we'll start to see that return to a more normal growth rate."

We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team's dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. So before we run through our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19.
Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort, and the team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B and RSV, from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar, but the treatments differ greatly. And this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome.
Now as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid's easy to use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians' testing arsenal. We are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team's fast and innovative response to the pandemic.
We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter diagnostics new IGM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear, and it's complementary to Beckman's IgG test, providing greater insight over the course of a patient's infection and immune progression.
While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies.
We are also proud to support the scientific community's pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.
As the market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and treatment.
So now let's take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth while our underlying base business was approximately -- was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter.
Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up approximately 10%, driven by sequential improvement in China and India.
Our gross profit margin was 54.8%, and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points with each of the 3 segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. 
Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59%, respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities.
We also continued to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher, with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19.
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We continued to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continue to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment, achieving low single-digit core revenue growth, driven in part by demand for new products, such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market.
Moving over to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5%, led by more than 100% core growth of Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert system placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continue to resume throughout the quarter.
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue and core revenues were down 1%, with similar results at both our water quality and product identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continue to resume, driving growth in North America and China, and this was offset by softness in the industrial end markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remain steady, supporting customers' mission-critical day-to-day water operation. And equipment declines moderated, and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running.
Now during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data. And these capabilities, combined with Hach's deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers' workflows.
At our product identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic.
Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look at trends across our end markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as Phase 3 openings proceeded across these regions. We're keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels.
Within Life Sciences, bioprocessing demand continues to lead the way. COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure. And collectively, these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bioprocessing workflow. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters.
Now as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time. And we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity. And in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels.
Moving to clinical diagnostics. We continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care setting. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production, and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter.
Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter, expanding their market-leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe, given its earlier reopening.
In the applied markets, consumables remain solid as customers sustain essential business operations for testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume, and we're seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new projects and capital investments.
So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter.
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our results this quarter, and we're proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities, and our strong performance is a testament to our associates' focused execution and commitment to our customers.
With the Danaher Business System as our driving force and a powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future.
Now before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial months as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio, an extraordinary team, and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I've had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher Business System and our culture of continuous improvement. It's clear that DBS is what drives it. It's who we are. It's how we do what we do. It's our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well everywhere.
So our future is bright, and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments in innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

So first of all, good morning, Tycho, and thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth",303,"Sure. So first of all, good morning, Tycho, and thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We're incredibly well positioned through the combination, of course, of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves. And then, of course, the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all the downstream fluid management filtration and chromatography solutions.
And so I think what you saw there in that step-up here quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction. We are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline, and we're playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of that bat.
And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here, going forward, we think that, as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly, as we think about '21 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there. And just to give you a sense of that, year-to-date, we have $1 billion -- well over $1 billion of COVID orders in combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech. And that's before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward."

You can imagine, as patients present, particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly. And the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we're really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond."

So customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and in hospitals to be able to diagnose and help customers. 
Now this test here -- and of course, this always depends on the type of customer, but the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test. And that compares to the COVID only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth. But that gives you a sense of it.
Now from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As you know, the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test, and that is going to be so useful for a clinician to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And so as you think about that, today, already, there are multiplex tests used for respiratory type ailments, and they're used all the time. And so we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don't see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test."

And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about -- we're still going to be producing COVID-only and the kind of staggered adoption because, one, you've got high-growth markets that really don't experience seasonal flu, so the demand for that is just not going to be as high, if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It's going to be country by country.

As we mentioned, we see China nearly at or at pre-pandemic levels. I would say, in North America and Western Europe, we see those lab capacities at about 70% to 80%, which is a sequential improvement, and we saw that. And so our teams are able to now get in to see the customers to install the systems, provide the services and so forth. But we still see some capacity limitations, as I mentioned earlier, related to social distancing measures and so forth.
Now having said that, in Q3, our tools business grew 10%. We're very happy about that. And that was driven certainly by IDT and Beckman Life Sciences, but also by new product launches, which were incredibly important for us and our customers, for instance, the Echo MS, which is the high-throughput screening tool used in front of mass spectrometers, which has been seeing an extraordinary uptake. The launch of the Triple Quad 7500. I mentioned that that's the most sensitive triple quad on the market, seeing great uptake for that. And that's driving -- that actually drove a positive low single-digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3.
And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the Stellaris Confocal Microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace as more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services has been helpful. But I think we've also been buffeted by this aggressive new product introduction that we've invested in here too for the future."

And right now, I'd also like to take this opportunity to start out and -- with thanking Tom and the Board and all the associates for the fantastic transition that they have provided me here over the last months and getting me off to what is a great start here for Danaher in Q3.
So I have worked for Tom a decade. And with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity, for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the Board have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company. And you'll see that I'm very passionate about the topic of innovation. You heard me comment on that today already, as well as talent. And so you'll see us continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent and our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company.
Having said that, with all these similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which we'll continue to focus on M&A and particularly making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward.
And when I started this role just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals. But certainly, initially, with the balance sheet, that means some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation in that: one, our free cash flow is stronger. Cytiva's performance is even better than expected, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that's really put us into a situation where we just have more degrees of freedom. And so that, from an M&A perspective, also put us in a position of being able to do certainly small and medium-sized strategic deals and then, as we go forward, get back into a stronger position pretty quickly."

What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher look",561,"Thanks, Doug. What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher look like pre-COVID, call it?
And let me start with our base business through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments had already been transitioning to a higher growth and earning profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre COVID, where we were already a 5% to 6% grower.
And to your point, including in that, the Cepheid growing at low double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point, we didn't even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking as we were diligence-ing and going to close, that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. So as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. But then also to your point, Cepheid might be back to low double digit, but it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020 with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace because we are at the point of care, because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID. We really see this point-of-care positioning as unique.
And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020. We really see this as a long-term improvement. Then you add to that Cytiva, which we're seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration, process chromatography and many more things, that we're getting so many at-bats with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccines that will ultimately receive approval. And so we think that, that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative and that for the long term we really can think high single-digit there as well.
And then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy, which is biased towards M&A. You add that on top of here, and we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile.
Now there's lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks, think of government spending, taxes, there are a number of variables here. So it's a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is a fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward."

So Q4, Cytiva, perhaps it's helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It's really important to see -- that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we have 3 working days left. And particularly for these consumer-oriented businesses, that's pretty impactful in the calculation.
Now having said that, as you think about the bioprocess industry today, already, these companies are producing vaccines. So if you think about Operation Warp Speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the pharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they're already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see -- vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government, and so there's a great deal of aggressiveness there. And so that's already happening here at the back end of Q3, and you'll see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we're hopeful that, that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well."

We have seen sort of Q2, Q3, we've had really good fall-through on the growth. I think as we sort of look at Q4, though, I think probably a 30% to 35% fall-through is a better number to use.

Like you said, we kind of -- as we look at where that's come from in Q2 and Q3, I mean, we've had some really, really good mix on where the growth's come from, Pall Biotech, think about Cytiva and Cepheid. And now that some of the other businesses are contributing more, I think we're going to have a bit of a mix impact.
And then as you mentioned, the lower OpEx, less travel and trades are certainly a part of it. Things are sort of getting going again, as you saw with the growth rates. And then Rainer talked about the accelerated growth spend. We're going to do that in Q4. We've got some projects already that we've got underway. I think that will have an impact on it. And probably lastly, frankly, we're -- given where we have seen some of the growth, and we've got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, around bonuses and things like that. It will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us. So I think it probably moderates a little bit here as we get into Q4 from where we've been but still feel, even with that, I still think we're going to be able to put up some pretty good EPS growth here."

It's so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still make very solid and defined projections pretty challenging. There's a lot of questions around which kind of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved. And we've seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given. These are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA. And there are a number of wild cards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So it's really important to understand that, prior to approval, picking what are the future ""winners"" is very difficult.
The other thing that's also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they're produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch, as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production.
We also have a lot of questions on the number of doses. Is it going to be a onetime shot with a booster for life? Or is it going to be much like we've seen for influenza, an annual-type injection that everybody needs? These are big questions that, of course, affect any kind of estimates that you make.
And then lastly, there's a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. So we see that it's very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps a quarter or so, we'll start seeing approvals. We're very hopeful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know what doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing.
And then I come back to what Matt said. If you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval. So we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so. But again, coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers is tough."

So sort of the near term, I think we still have some upside here as we get kind of into Q4, and then as the vaccines get approved and then as we start to learn some of these unknown variables that we can start to give you guys a better kind of a view of. But so far, I think it gives you a frame of what we've got. We've got the Q4, how that plays out. And then as we know more, I think as we get into early next year, we'll probably have a better frame for you, hopefully, to get some clarity around that."

So any way to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look at the '21 under some of those scenarios?

A lot of people talk about the antigen test. And most of those are used in different care settings. Our -- the Cepheid solution, GeneXpert, that is used at the point of care in critical care environments and in the hospital when speed, workflow and accuracy really count. So those clinicians on the basis of that test are going to make call as to what therapy they prescribe. So it has to be right. It just has to be right. And so that's why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that's why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place, at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect, independent of the number of infections that we see, other types of modalities really breathing, either higher or lower depending on the infection rate. But as you think about the point of care, hospitals, in particular, and other point-of-care setting, that's what we see as gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test, to have an extraordinary amount of durability. 
And we see that, right? And you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 million to 7 million, in the fourth quarter, 8 million. And you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that the fact that we've increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position, and that installed base continues to grow."

And what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So not only do we see, of course, extraordinary return to lab capacities, which are nearly or at pre-pandemic level, we also see the return of patient volumes, to some degree, approaching normality. And what's unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So the recovery in China in contrast to North America and Western Europe is broader-based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have, industrial businesses we have with Pall, we're seeing very nice recoveries there. And like we said, in China, we saw essentially 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well as that economy continues to build momentum. And that's really across the portfolio.
Now as we think about Beckman diagnostics and our business there, we're really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectations. And the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. And so we have a great deal of momentum here, and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly.
And as we think of capital, we're starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placements. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so those conversations are starting to happen.
Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor as we see good hotspots continue to pop up around the world, is that for now we haven't seen anything, but on the margin, impacted in the patient volume returning, meaning that we've seen wellness testing and elective-type procedures continuing to ramp and not being significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots. So cautiously optimistic here that the progression that we've seen for Beckman diagnostics and more generally with patient volumes continues to move forward positively."

We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team's dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. 
So before we run through our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort, and the team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments differ greatly, and this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome. Now as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid's easy-to-use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians' testing arsenal, and we are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team's fast and innovative response to the pandemic. 
We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' new IgM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear and is complementary to Beckman's IgG test, providing greater insight over the course of a patient's infection and immune progression. While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies. 
We are also proud to support the scientific community's pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. As the market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. 
So now let's take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth while our underlying base business was approximately -- was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up approximately 10%, driven by sequential improvement in China and India. 
Our gross profit margin was 54.8%, and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points with each of the 3 segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. 
We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59%, respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. We also continued to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We continued to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. 
In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continued to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment, achieving low single-digit core revenue growth, driven in part by demand for new products such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market. 
Moving over to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5%, led by more than 100% core growth of Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert system placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continued to resume throughout the quarter. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue and core revenues were down 1%, with similar results at both our water quality and Product Identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continued to resume, driving growth in North America and China, and this was offset by softness in the industrial end markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remain steady, supporting customers' mission-critical day-to-day water operation. And equipment declines moderated, and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running. 
Now during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data. And these capabilities, combined with Hach's deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers' workflows. 
At our Product Identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. 
Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look at recent trends across our end markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as phased reopenings proceed across these regions. We're keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels. 
Within Life Sciences, bioprocessing demand continues to lead the way. COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale-up occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure, and collectively, these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bioprocessing workflow. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time. And we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity, and in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to clinical diagnostics. We continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care setting. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production, and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter. Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter, expanding their market-leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. 
Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe, given its earlier reopening. 
In the applied markets, consumables remained solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume, and we're seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new projects and capital investments. 
So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. 
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our results this quarter, and we're proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities, and our strong performance is a testament to our associates' focused execution and commitment to our customers. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force and the powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future. 
Now before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial months as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio, an extraordinary team, and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I've had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. 
One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher Business System and our culture of continuous improvement. 
It's clear that DBS is what drives it. It's who we are. It's how we do what we do. It's our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well everywhere. 
So our future is bright, and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments in innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

So first of all, Tycho, thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique port",301,"Sure. So first of all, Tycho, thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We're incredibly well positioned through the combination, of course, of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves and then, of course, the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all of the downstream fluid management, filtration and chromatography solutions. 
And so I think what you saw there in that step-up here quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction. We are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline, and we're playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of at-bat. 
And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here going forward, we think that as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly, as we think about '21 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there. And just to give you a sense of that, we, year-to-date, have $1 billion -- well over $1 billion of COVID orders in the combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech, and that's before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward."

And we also, at the same time, at the end of September, launched this 4-in-1 test, which really positions us uniquely and extraordinarily in order to be able to address the opportunity and the need in particular here as the flu season arises. You can imagine, as patients present particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly, and the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we're really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond."

We, in fact, have launched this 4-in-1 test here in September and are already shipping, and we're seeing great customer demand for this. So customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and in hospitals to be able to diagnose and help customers.  
Now this test here -- and of course, this always depends on the type of customer, but the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test. And that compares to the COVID-only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth, but that gives you a sense of it. 
Now from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As you know, the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test, and that is going to be so useful for a clinician to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And so as you think about that, today, already, there are multiplex tests used for respiratory type ailments, and they're used all the time. And so we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don't see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test."

So I think in Q4 -- thinking about maybe 60% of our test volume in Q4 is going to be COVID-only and then the other 40% will be the 4-in-1. 
And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about -- we're still going to be producing COVID-only and the kind of staggered adoption because, one, you've got high-growth markets that really don't experience seasonal flu so the demand for that is just not going to be as high, if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It's going to be country by country. It's not going to be kind of uniform like it might be in the U.S. So just maybe to think about from a modeling perspective, that split would be the way I'd think about that."

And so our teams are able to now get in to see the customers to install the systems, provide the services and so forth. But we still see some capacity limitations, as I mentioned earlier, related to social distancing measures and so forth. 
Now having said that, in Q3, our tools business grew 10%. We're very happy about that. And that was driven certainly by IDT and Beckman Life Sciences but also by new product launches which were incredibly important for us and our customers, for instance, the Echo MS, which is the high-throughput screening tool used in front of mass spectrometers, which has been seeing an extraordinary uptake; the launch of the Triple Quad 7500. I mentioned that that's the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market, seeing great uptake for that. And that's driving -- that actually drove a positive low single-digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3. 
And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the STELLARIS confocal microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace with more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services has been helpful. But I think we've also been buffeted by this aggressive new product introduction that we've invested in here too for the future."

So I have worked for Tom a decade and with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity, for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the Board have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company. 
And you'll see that I'm very passionate about the topic of innovation, you heard me comment on that today already, as well as talent. And so you'll see us continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent and our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company. Having said that, with all these similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which we'll continue to focus on M&A and particularly making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward. 
And when I started this role just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals but certainly, initially, with a balance sheet that needs some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation in that, one, our free cash flow is stronger. Cytiva's performance is even better than expected, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that's really put us into a situation where we just have more degrees of freedom.

How do you balance the desire to fulfill acute Rx and vaccine development demand related to the pandemic with the outlook for post-pandemic demand? I mean, I guess, to be more to the point, do you believe the capacity you're building today will continue to be used even post pandemic? And thus, should we view the elevated revenue levels associated with your build-out as being durable even after the surge in pandemic-related demand subsides? 
And I guess while on this topic, along those same lines, you're placing a lot of GeneXperts today. They're going to be used for the foreseeable future as much as people can get those, at least in our opinion, just given what's going on. But post pandemic, how do you think about the durability of these placements and the associated revenue potential?"

What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looks like pre COVID, call it? 
And let me start with our base business. Through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments, had already been transitioning to a higher growth and earning profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre COVID, where we were already a 5% to 6% grower; and to your point, included in that, with Cepheid growing at low double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point, we didn't even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking, as we were diligence-ing and going to close, that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. 
So as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. 
But then also, to your point, Cepheid might be back to low double digit, but it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020 with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace because we are at the point of care, because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID. We really see this point-of-care positioning as unique. And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020. We really see this as a long-term improvement. 
Then you add to that Cytiva, which we're seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration, process chromatography and many more things, that we're getting so many at-bats with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccines that will ultimately receive approval. And so we think that, that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative and that for the long term, we really can think high single-digit there as well. 
And then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy, which is biased towards M&A. You add that on top of here, and we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile. 
Now there's lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks. Think of government spending, taxes. There are a number of variables here. So it's a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is a fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward."

I would also say we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we're making in the transition of the GE Biopharma business, now Cytiva, into Danaher, and they are firing on all cylinders. And we continue to extricate ourselves there from the transition services that GE provides us and standing up this organization and see just extraordinary not only efforts but real results there.
So we always at Danaher maintain leadership and management capacity to ensure that the opportunities that we generate and that the market provides us, we can take advantage of. And so whilst we are transitioning Cytiva into Danaher and nearly complete with that, that doesn't keep us from being ambidextrous here and keeping our eye and being able to take advantages -- take advantage of the opportunity that the market provides."

So Q4 Cytiva, perhaps it's helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It's really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we have 3 working days less, and particularly for these consumer-oriented businesses, that's pretty impactful in the calculation.
Now having said that, as you think about the bioprocesses industry today, already, these companies are producing vaccines. So if you think about Operation Warp Speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the pharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they're already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see -- vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government, and so there's a great deal of aggressiveness there. 
And so that's already happening here at the back end of Q3, and you'll see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we're hopeful that, that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well."

And then as you mentioned, the lower OpEx, less travel and trade shows is certainly a part of it. Things are sort of getting going again, as you saw with the growth rates. And then Rainer talked about the accelerated growth spend. We're going to do that in Q4. We've got some projects already that we've got underway. I think that will have an impact on it. 
And probably lastly, frankly, we're -- given where we have seen some of the growth, and we've got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, around bonuses and things like that, that will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us.

It's so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still make very solid and defined projections pretty challenging. There's a lot of questions around which kinds of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved. 
And we've seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given. These are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA. And there are a number of wild cards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time, can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So it's really important to understand that, prior to approval, picking what are the future ""winners"" is very difficult.
The other thing that's also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they're produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch, as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production.
We also have a lot of questions around the number of doses. Is it going to be a onetime shot with a booster for life? Or is it going to be much like we've seen for influenza, an annual-type injection that everybody needs? These are big questions that, of course, affect any kind of estimates that you make. And then lastly, there's a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. 
So we see that it's very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps a quarter or so, we'll start seeing approvals. We're very hopeful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know about doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing.
And then I come back to what Matt said. If you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval. So we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so. But again, coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers is tough."

So any way to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look out to '21 under some of those scenarios?

So those clinicians, on the basis of that test, are going to make call as to what therapy they prescribe. So it has to be right. It just has to be right. 
And so that's why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that's why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place, at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect, independent of the number of infections that we see, other types of modalities really breathing either higher or lower, depending on the infection rate. But as you think about the point of care, hospitals in particular, and other point-of-care setting, that's where we see this gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test, to have an extraordinary amount of durability. 
And we see that, right? And you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 million to 7 million; in the fourth quarter, 8 million. And you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. 
So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that the fact that we've increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position. And that installed base continues to grow."

China has been an extraordinary story, as you all know, in terms of the speed of the recovery. And what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So not only do we see, of course, extraordinary return to lab capacities, which are nearly or at pre-pandemic levels, we also see the return of patient volumes, to some degree, approaching normality. 
And what's unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So the recovery in China, in contrast to North America and Western Europe, is broader-based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have -- industrial businesses we have with Pall, we're seeing very nice recoveries there. And like we said, in China, we saw essentially 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well as that economy continues to build momentum. And that's really across the portfolio.
Now as we think about Beckman Diagnostics and our business there, we're really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectations. And the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. And so we have a great deal of momentum here, and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly.
And as we think of capital, we're starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placements. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so those conversations are starting to happen.
Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor as we see COVID hotspots continue to pop up around the world, is that for now we haven't seen anything but on the margin impacted in the patient volume returning, meaning that we've seen wellness testing and elective-type procedures continuing to ramp and not being significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots.

This strong performance is a testam",1889,"Well, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team's dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. 
So before we run through our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort, and the team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments differ greatly, and this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome. Now as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid's easy-to-use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians' testing arsenal, and we are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team's fast and innovative response to the pandemic. 
We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' new IgM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear and is complementary to Beckman's IgG test, providing greater insight over the course of a patient's infection and immune progression. While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies. 
We are also proud to support the scientific community's pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. As the market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. 
So now let's take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth while our underlying base business was approximately -- was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up approximately 10%, driven by sequential improvement in China and India. 
Our gross profit margin was 54.8%, and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points with each of the 3 segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. 
We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59%, respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. We also continued to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We continued to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. 
In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continued to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment, achieving low single-digit core revenue growth, driven in part by demand for new products such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market. 
Moving over to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5%, led by more than 100% core growth of Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert system placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continued to resume throughout the quarter. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue and core revenues were down 1%, with similar results at both our water quality and Product Identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continued to resume, driving growth in North America and China, and this was offset by softness in the industrial end markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remain steady, supporting customers' mission-critical day-to-day water operation. And equipment declines moderated, and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running. 
Now during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data. And these capabilities, combined with Hach's deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers' workflows. 
At our Product Identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. 
Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look at recent trends across our end markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as phased reopenings proceed across these regions. We're keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels. 
Within Life Sciences, bioprocessing demand continues to lead the way. COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale-up occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure, and collectively, these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bioprocessing workflow. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time. And we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity, and in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to clinical diagnostics. We continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care setting. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production, and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter. Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter, expanding their market-leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. 
Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe, given its earlier reopening. 
In the applied markets, consumables remained solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume, and we're seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new projects and capital investments. 
So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. 
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our results this quarter, and we're proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities, and our strong performance is a testament to our associates' focused execution and commitment to our customers. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force and the powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future. 
Now before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial months as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio, an extraordinary team, and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I've had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. 
One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher Business System and our culture of continuous improvement. 
It's clear that DBS is what drives it. It's who we are. It's how we do what we do. It's our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well everywhere. 
So our future is bright, and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments in innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

So first of all, Tycho, thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We're incredibly well positioned through the combination, of course, of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves and then, of course, the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all of the downstream fluid management, filtration and chromatography solutions. 
And so I think what you saw there in that step-up here quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction. We are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline, and we're playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of at-bat. 
And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here going forward, we think that as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly, as we think about '21 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there. And just to give you a sense of that, we, year-to-date, have $1 billion -- well over $1 billion of COVID orders in the combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech, and that's before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward."

And we also, at the same time, at the end of September, launched this 4-in-1 test, which really positions us uniquely and extraordinarily in order to be able to address the opportunity and the need in particular here as the flu season arises. You can imagine, as patients present particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly, and the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we're really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond."

So customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and in hospitals to be able to diagnose and help customers. 
Now this test here -- and of course, this always depends on the type of customer, but the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test. And that compares to the COVID-only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth, but that gives you a sense of it. 
Now from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As you know, the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test, and that is going to be so useful for a clinician to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And so as you think about that, today, already, there are multiplex tests used for respiratory type ailments, and they're used all the time. And so we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don't see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test."

So I think in Q4 -- thinking about maybe 60% of our test volume in Q4 is going to be COVID-only and then the other 40% will be the 4-in-1. 
And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about -- we're still going to be producing COVID-only and the kind of staggered adoption because, one, you've got high-growth markets that really don't experience seasonal flu so the demand for that is just not going to be as high, if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It's going to be country by country. It's not going to be kind of uniform like it might be in the U.S. So just maybe to think about from a modeling perspective, that split would be the way I'd think about that."

I mentioned that that's the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market, seeing great uptake for that. And that's driving -- that actually drove a positive low single-digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3. 
And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the STELLARIS confocal microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace with more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services has been helpful. But I think we've also been buffeted by this aggressive new product introduction that we've invested in here too for the future."

And right now, I'd also like to take this opportunity to start out and -- with thanking Tom and the Board and all the associates for the fantastic transition that they have provided me here over the last months and getting me off to what is a great start here for Danaher in Q3. 
So I have worked for Tom a decade and with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity, for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the Board have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company. 
And you'll see that I'm very passionate about the topic of innovation, you heard me comment on that today already as well as talent. And so you'll see us continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent and our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company. Having said that, with all these similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which we'll continue to focus on M&A and particularly making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward. 
And when I started this role just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals but certainly, initially, with a balance sheet that needs some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation in that, one, our free cash flow is stronger. Cytiva's performance is even better than expected, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that's really put us into a situation where we just have more degrees of freedom. And so that, from an M&A perspective, also put us in a position of being able to do, certainly, small and medium-sized strategic deals and then, as we go forward, get back into a stronger position pretty quickly."

What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looks like pre COVID, call it? 
And let me start with our base business. Through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments, had already been transitioning to a higher growth and earning profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre COVID, where we were already a 5% to 6% grower; and to your point, included in that, with Cepheid growing at low double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point, we didn't even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking, as we were diligence-ing and going to close, that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. 
So as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. 
But then also, to your point, Cepheid might be back to low double digit, but it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020 with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace because we are at the point of care, because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID. We really see this point-of-care positioning as unique. And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020. We really see this as a long-term improvement. 
Then you add to that Cytiva, which we're seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration, process chromatography and many more things, that we're getting so many at-bats with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccines that will ultimately receive approval. And so we think that, that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative and that for the long term, we really can think high single-digit there as well. 
And then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy, which is biased towards M&A. You add that on top of here, and we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile. 
Now there's lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks. Think of government spending, taxes. There are a number of variables here. So it's a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is a fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward."

First of all, speaking to the balance sheet.

I would also say we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we're making in the transition of the GE Biopharma business, now Cytiva, into Danaher, and they are firing on all cylinders. And we continue to extricate ourselves there from the transition services that GE provides us and standing up this organization and see just extraordinary not only efforts but real results there.
So we always at Danaher maintain leadership and management capacity to ensure that the opportunities that we generate and that the market provides us, we can take advantage of.

So Q4 Cytiva, perhaps it's helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It's really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we have 3 working days less, and particularly for these consumer-oriented businesses, that's pretty impactful in the calculation.
Now having said that, as you think about the bioprocesses industry today, already, these companies are producing vaccines. So if you think about Operation Warp Speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the pharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they're already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see -- vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government, and so there's a great deal of aggressiveness there. 
And so that's already happening here at the back end of Q3, and you'll see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we're hopeful that, that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well."

And probably lastly, frankly, we're -- given where we have seen some of the growth, and we've got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, around bonuses and things like that, that will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us.

It's so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still make very solid and defined projections pretty challenging. There's a lot of questions around which kinds of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved. 
And we've seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given. These are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA. And there are a number of wild cards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time, can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So it's really important to understand that, prior to approval, picking what are the future ""winners"" is very difficult.
The other thing that's also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they're produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch, as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production.
We also have a lot of questions around the number of doses. Is it going to be a onetime shot with a booster for life? Or is it going to be much like we've seen for influenza, an annual-type injection that everybody needs? These are big questions that, of course, affect any kind of estimates that you make. And then lastly, there's a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. 
So we see that it's very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps a quarter or so, we'll start seeing approvals. We're very hopeful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know about doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing.
And then I come back to what Matt said. If you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval. So we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so. But again, coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers is tough."

So any way to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look out to '21 under some of those scenarios? Because I think you are in an interesting position where you're not the kind of batch-based slower PCR, so you kind of sit in between 2 different areas. So any color on that would be great."

A lot of people talk about the antigen test. And most of those are used in different care settings. 
Our -- the Cepheid solution, GeneXpert, that is used at the point of care in critical care environments and in the hospital when speed, workflow and accuracy really count. So those clinicians, on the basis of that test, are going to make call as to what therapy they prescribe. So it has to be right. It just has to be right. 
And so that's why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that's why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place, at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect, independent of the number of infections that we see, other types of modalities really breathing either higher or lower, depending on the infection rate. But as you think about the point of care, hospitals in particular, and other point-of-care setting, that's where we see this gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test, to have an extraordinary amount of durability. 
And we see that, right? And you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 million to 7 million; in the fourth quarter, 8 million. And you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. 
So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that the fact that we've increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position. And that installed base continues to grow."

Well, let's start with China. China has been an extraordinary story, as you all know, in terms of the speed of the recovery. And what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So not only do we see, of cours",415,"No worries. Thanks, Steve. Well, let's start with China. 
China has been an extraordinary story, as you all know, in terms of the speed of the recovery. And what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So not only do we see, of course, extraordinary return to lab capacities, which are nearly or at pre-pandemic levels, we also see the return of patient volumes, to some degree, approaching normality. 
And what's unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So the recovery in China, in contrast to North America and Western Europe, is broader-based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have -- industrial businesses we have with Pall, we're seeing very nice recoveries there. And like we said, in China, we saw essentially 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well as that economy continues to build momentum. And that's really across the portfolio.
Now as we think about Beckman Diagnostics and our business there, we're really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectations. And the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. And so we have a great deal of momentum here, and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly.
And as we think of capital, we're starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placements. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so those conversations are starting to happen.
Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor as we see COVID hotspots continue to pop up around the world, is that for now we haven't seen anything but on the margin impacted in the patient volume returning, meaning that we've seen wellness testing and elective-type procedures continuing to ramp and not being significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots. So cautiously optimistic here that the progression that we've seen for Beckman Diagnostics and more generally, with patient volumes continues to move forward positively."

We delivered an outstanding third quarter with results in the mid-teens core revenue, over 60% adjusted EPS growth and more than doubled our year-over-year free cash flow. This strong performance is a testament to our team's dedication as they stay focused on executing for our customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have met the challenges presented and turned them into impactful opportunities to support patients, our customers and the global community. 
So before we run through our third quarter results, I'd like to update you on how we are directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. Cepheid continues to be a leader in the global diagnostic testing effort, and the team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis was further demonstrated by the recent launch of a rapid 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV from a single patient sample. The symptoms for each of these viruses are very similar but the treatments differ greatly, and this test will provide clinicians with critical answers in approximately 35 minutes to help ensure the best patient outcome. Now as we head into flu season, we believe Cepheid's easy-to-use rapid 4-in-1 test will be a critical tool in clinicians' testing arsenal, and we are incredibly proud of the Cepheid team's fast and innovative response to the pandemic. 
We further enhanced our diagnostic testing capabilities with Beckman Coulter Diagnostics' new IgM serology and IL-6 assays. The IL-6 assay can help identify severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, a crucial consideration as clinicians evaluate the risk of intubation with mechanical ventilation. The IgM serology assay can detect IgM antibodies to the virus, which typically begin to develop shortly after symptoms appear and is complementary to Beckman's IgG test, providing greater insight over the course of a patient's infection and immune progression. While the use of COVID-19 antibody testing is relatively limited today, in the future, it may play a critical role pre and post vaccination for population surveillance and clinical trial studies. 
We are also proud to support the scientific community's pursuit of new vaccines and therapeutics for the virus. Pall and Cytiva's products and solutions are involved in the majority of the more than 400 vaccine and therapeutic projects currently underway globally, including every Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. As the market leader across the bioprocessing workflow, the breadth of our offering and technical expertise are key differentiators that enable us to contribute meaningfully to the development and production of COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. 
So now let's take a look at our third quarter results. We generated $5.9 billion of sales with 14% core revenue growth. COVID-related revenue tailwinds contributed approximately 1,000 basis points to third quarter core revenue growth while our underlying base business was approximately -- was up approximately 4%, a sequential improvement from an approximate 3% decline in the second quarter. Geographically, revenue in the developed markets was up mid-teens, led by North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up approximately 10%, driven by sequential improvement in China and India. 
Our gross profit margin was 54.8%, and our operating profit margin of 18.5% was up 80 basis points. Our core operating profit margin was up 310 basis points with each of the 3 segments achieving 75 basis points or more of core margin expansion. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were up 62% versus last year. 
We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion year-to-date, up 110% and 59%, respectively, with 174% free cash flow to net income conversion in the quarter. This outstanding cash flow generation, combined with our strong balance sheet, positions us well to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. We also continued to accelerate organic growth investments across Danaher with a particular focus on expanding production capacity at Cepheid, Cytiva and Pall Biotech to support increasing demand driven by COVID-19. 
So now let's take a more detailed look at our results across the portfolio. Life Sciences core revenue was up 18.5%, led by core growth rates of 20% or more at Pall Biotech and Beckman Life Sciences and more than 35% at Cytiva and IDT. We continued to see strong demand from customers building out their genomics and automation capabilities and from our biopharma customers working on COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. 
In our more instrument-oriented life science businesses, declines moderated as academic and research labs continued to reopen, driving increased installations and better order trends. SCIEX benefited from this improving environment, achieving low single-digit core revenue growth, driven in part by demand for new products such as the Echo MS and the Triple Quad 7500, the most sensitive mass spectrometer on the market. 
Moving over to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 18% and core revenue was up 17.5%, led by more than 100% core growth of Cepheid as a result of COVID-19 testing volumes and record GeneXpert system placements. Radiometer and Leica Biosystems, our acute care and pathology businesses, delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Declines at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics moderated as elective procedures and wellness checks continued to resume throughout the quarter. 
Moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue and core revenues were down 1%, with similar results at both our water quality and Product Identification platforms. Across our water quality businesses, municipal activity and projects continued to resume, driving growth in North America and China, and this was offset by softness in the industrial end markets globally. Demand for our consumables and chemistries remain steady, supporting customers' mission-critical day-to-day water operation. And equipment declines moderated, and we were encouraged by equipment order trends in the quarter as more customer facilities got back up and running. 
Now during the quarter, Hach closed the acquisition of Aquatic Informatics, a leader in water-focused software solutions. Aquatic Informatics solutions collect, manage and analyze large volumes of water data. And these capabilities, combined with Hach's deep applications expertise, will help us bring greater operational efficiencies to customers' workflows. 
At our Product Identification platform, low single-digit core revenue growth at Videojet was driven by strong demand in North America, particularly across the consumer packaged goods, food and beverage and pharmaceutical end markets. Consumables and services performed well globally as Videojet continued to help customers keep their essential businesses operating through the pandemic. 
Now with that as context for what we saw by segment during the quarter, let's take a look at recent trends across our end markets. Geographically, customer activity continues to increase in the U.S. and Europe as phased reopenings proceed across these regions. We're keeping an eye on areas that have recently experienced setbacks in the process of reopening, but we have not seen any material impact so far. And China is progressing well with activity in most regions approaching pre-pandemic levels. 
Within Life Sciences, bioprocessing demand continues to lead the way. COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic activity increased meaningfully during the quarter with development and production scale-up occurring at an accelerated pace. Cytiva and Pall Biotech comprise most of our bioprocessing exposure, and collectively, these businesses increased orders by more than 60% in the quarter, driven by our comprehensive offering across the bioprocessing workflow. Non-COVID-related bioprocessing activity remains healthy and in line with what we saw over the last several quarters. 
Now as I mentioned earlier, academic and research labs around the world are continuing to reopen at reduced capacity as social distancing measures limit the number of people allowed in the lab at any one time. And we estimate that approximately 60% to 70% of academic research labs are now open in some capacity, and in China, that number is closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
Moving to clinical diagnostics. We continue to see strong demand for molecular testing in both hospital lab and point-of-care setting. Since launching the first rapid molecular test for COVID-19 in March, Cepheid has meaningfully increased production capacity and shipped more than 7 million test cartridges in the third quarter. The team continues to ramp test production, and we now expect to ship more than 8 million tests in the fourth quarter. Cepheid also delivered another record number of new systems in the third quarter, expanding their market-leading global installed base by approximately 35% over the past year. 
Across hospital and reference labs, patient volumes increased through the quarter as elective procedures and wellness checks resumed across much of the developed markets. We estimate that global patient volumes are currently 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels with China slightly ahead of North America and Europe, given its earlier reopening. 
In the applied markets, consumables remained solid as customers sustain essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging food, medicine and consumer products. Previously delayed equipment installations are starting to resume, and we're seeing our equipment order books improving as customers start to initiate new projects and capital investments. 
So as we look ahead, we expect to deliver low double-digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Modest sequential improvement across our businesses will be offset by the impact of 3 fewer selling days versus last year, which represents a core growth headwind of more than 300 basis points. We anticipate COVID-19-related revenue tailwinds will be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. 
So to wrap up, we're really pleased with our results this quarter, and we're proud to play a pivotal role in tackling COVID-19 head on. Our team has turned unprecedented challenges into tremendous opportunities, and our strong performance is a testament to our associates' focused execution and commitment to our customers. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force and the powerful combination of our talented team, exceptional portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, we believe Danaher will continue to outperform through the remainder of 2020 and well into the future. 
Now before I go on to the Q&A, I just want to take a moment to share a few thoughts after my initial months as CEO. First, I always knew we had an exceptional portfolio, an extraordinary team, and that conviction has only been reinforced over the last few months as I've had the opportunity to spend more time with more of our businesses and leaders. And in doing so, a couple of things really stand out. 
One is the considerable amount of innovation happening across the organization. Our investments in R&D and commercial initiatives are allowing us to continue building sustainable competitive advantages all across our businesses. The other standout for me is the caliber and the depth of talent we have across Danaher. Our associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to the Danaher Business System and our culture of continuous improvement. 
It's clear that DBS is what drives it. It's who we are. It's how we do what we do. It's our ultimate competitive advantage. And I see it alive and well everywhere. 
So our future is bright, and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. I believe that the combination of our investments in innovation, outstanding team and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to keep building an even better, stronger company as we move forward. 
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt."

So first of all, Tycho, thanks for the question. As I think about the larger opportunity here, particularly in the vaccines and therapeutics, it might be helpful just to back up one second and think about the scale and the breadth of our unique portfolio. We're incredibly well positioned through the combination, of course, of Pall and Cytiva, but also upstream with many of our companies being involved in the development of the actual drugs themselves and then, of course, the process scale-up, the upstream solutions, including cell culture media, single-use bioreactors and then all of the downstream fluid management, filtration and chromatography solutions. 
And so I think what you saw there in that step-up here quarter-over-quarter was the breadth of that portfolio and the capability of those teams really moving forward and gaining traction. We are on top of well over 400 vaccines and therapeutics that are in the pipeline, and we're playing in the great majority of those in one capacity or another. And so the nature of our portfolio, the focus of our teams, the trust that the customers have in us is giving us an extraordinary number of at-bat. 
And so as you think about that portfolio positioning here going forward, we think that as the capacity needs of our customers continue to ramp, certainly, as we think about '21 and beyond, we expect to play very, very well there. And just to give you a sense of that, we, year-to-date, have $1 billion -- well over $1 billion of COVID orders in the combination of Cytiva and Pall Biotech, and that's before any vaccines have been officially approved by the FDA. So again, we really see an opportunity here for the long term to really capture an extraordinary amount of opportunity and share going forward."

And we also, at the same time, at the end of September, launched this 4-in-1 test, which really positions us uniquely and extraordinarily in order to be able to address the opportunity and the need in particular here as the flu season arises. You can imagine, as patients present particularly in hospitals and points of care, that physicians will want to know the right answer quickly, and the right answer needs to distinguish between COVID and the flu season. So we're really thinking of this as the flu season and COVID testing both being tailwinds as we go into Q4 and beyond."

That increased to about 7 million here in Q3, and we expect that to go in Q4 to, call it, maybe closer to 8 million. 
And as we sort of ramp through '21, we are going to be adding additional capacity as well. Now I'm not sure exactly when we expect all of that to come online.

So customers are really recognizing what an incredible tool this is at the point of care and in hospitals to be able to diagnose and help customers. 
Now this test here -- and of course, this always depends on the type of customer, but the 4-in-1 test will be priced right around $55 to $60 per test. And that compares to the COVID-only of about $20 to $40. Once again, depends on the type of customer and volumes and so forth, but that gives you a sense of it. 
Now from a reimbursement perspective, we feel very good about this for a number of reasons. As you know, the 4-in-1 test is a multiplex test, and that is going to be so useful for a clinician to determine what type of treatment will be suitable for that particular patient. And so as you think about that, today, already, there are multiplex tests used for respiratory type ailments, and they're used all the time. And so we see that our customers are very familiar with the reimbursement dynamics here and don't see any issues as it relates to the Cepheid 4-in-1 multiplex test."

So I think in Q4 -- thinking about maybe 60% of our test volume in Q4 is going to be COVID-only and then the other 40% will be the 4-in-1. 
And I think the way to kind of think about that is that when you think about -- we're still going to be producing COVID-only and the kind of staggered adoption because, one, you've got high-growth markets that really don't experience seasonal flu so the demand for that is just not going to be as high, if any. And Europe is going to be more of a staggered adoption. It's going to be country by country. It's not going to be kind of uniform like it might be in the U.S. So just maybe to think about from a modeling perspective, that split would be the way I'd think about that."

And so our teams are able to now get in to see the customers to install the systems, provide the services and so forth. But we still see some capacity limitations, as I mentioned earlier, related to social distancing measures and so forth. 
Now having said that, in Q3, our tools business grew 10%. We're very happy about that. And that was driven certainly by IDT and Beckman Life Sciences but also by new product launches which were incredibly important for us and our customers, for instance, the Echo MS, which is the high-throughput screening tool used in front of mass spectrometers, which has been seeing an extraordinary uptake; the launch of the Triple Quad 7500. I mentioned that that's the most sensitive Triple Quad on the market, seeing great uptake for that. And that's driving -- that actually drove a positive low single-digit growth already for SCIEX in Q3. 
And then at Leica Microsystems, we had recently launched the STELLARIS confocal microscope, which is the most versatile and powerful confocal microscope in the market. So this combination of certainly sequential improvement in the marketplace with more labs being accessible, us being able to get in and install and provide services has been helpful. But I think we've also been buffeted by this aggressive new product introduction that we've invested in here too for the future."

And right now, I'd also like to take this opportunity to start out and -- with thanking Tom and the Board and all the associates for the fantastic transition that they have provided me here over the last months and getting me off to what is a great start here for Danaher in Q3. 
So I have worked for Tom a decade and with that, of course, also with our Board. And what you can expect there is a great deal of consistency and continuity, for sure. And my plan, of course, is to build on the fantastic foundation that Tom and the Board have laid and making us a stronger science and technology company. 
And you'll see that I'm very passionate about the topic of innovation, you heard me comment on that today already as well as talent. And so you'll see us continue investing here quite significantly in innovation and in our talent and our scientific capabilities, whether those be internal or external, as we continue to chart our course here forward as a leading science and technology company. Having said that, with all these similarities, you can also expect to see no change as it relates to our capital allocation bias, which we'll continue to focus on M&A and particularly making us a stronger innovation and growth company as we continue to move forward. 
And when I started this role just after we had closed the Cytiva deal, I thought that perhaps I would be sitting here with the ability to make some smaller deals but certainly, initially, with a balance sheet that needs some rebuilding. And we find ourselves here in a great situation in that, one, our free cash flow is stronger. Cytiva's performance is even better than expected, and we couldn't be more pleased with how the team is transitioning and being a part of Danaher. And then you add the equity raise to that, and that's really put us into a situation where we just have more degrees of freedom. And so that, from an M&A perspective, also put us in a position of being able to do, certainly, small and medium-sized strategic deals and then, as we go forward, get back into a stronger position pretty quickly."

What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looks",562,"Thanks, Doug. What I'd like to do is take your question and even broaden it a bit to let you -- to hear how we think about the long term here. And the way we frame that is, what does the world look like post vaccine versus what the world for Danaher looks like pre COVID, call it? 
And let me start with our base business. Through the portfolio moves that we have made and the investments, had already been transitioning to a higher growth and earning profile with a higher degree of recurring revenues. And so we feel very good about the growth profile that we had pre COVID, where we were already a 5% to 6% grower; and to your point, included in that, with Cepheid growing at low double digits at the time, representing about 5% of our portfolio. And at that point, we didn't even own Cytiva yet, although we were thinking, as we were diligence-ing and going to close, that this would be about a 6% to 7% grower. 
So as we think now about a post-vaccine world, we actually really believe that our core growth is going to improve. And why is that? Well, first of all, our base business will continue to improve as activity picks up and markets recover and our innovation investments, some of which I talked about earlier, start paying off even more. 
But then also, to your point, Cepheid might be back to low double digit, but it will represent 10% of our portfolio in 2020 with what we think are some of the most durable testing revenues in the marketplace because we are at the point of care because our workflow is so easy, because of the menu breadth we have with both multiplex or COVID. We really see this point-of-care positioning as unique. And then you add on top of that, and you mentioned this, our increase in the installed base, 35% increase over prior year just in 2020. We really see this as a long-term improvement. 
Then you add to that Cytiva, which we're seeing now with the leading positions in cell culture media, single-use technologies, including bioreactors, filtration, process chromatography and many more things, that we're getting so many at-bats with these over 400 vaccines and therapeutics in the pipeline that we see an extraordinary potential there for the traction and the capacity increases that are needed for the future, independent of the type of vaccines that will ultimately receive approval. And so we think that, that 6% to 7% growth assumption that we had here prior to the pandemic was likely conservative and that for the long term, we really can think high single-digit there as well. 
And then lastly, you see our capital allocation strategy, which is biased towards M&A. You add that on top of here, and we really do believe that our growth profile as a result of the pandemic and the durability of our positioning in the aftermath of all of that is going to result in a higher growth profile. 
Now there's lots of things here to consider in terms of macro risks. Think of government spending, taxes. There are a number of variables here. So it's a little bit early here to be conclusive. But what we see here is a fundamentally stronger and more durable growth profile going forward."

First of all, speaking to the balance sheet.

I would also say we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we're making in the transition of the GE Biopharma business, now Cytiva, into Danaher, and they are firing on all cylinders. And we continue to extricate ourselves there from the transition services that GE provides us and standing up this organization and see just extraordinary not only efforts but real results there.

So Q4 Cytiva, perhaps it's helpful to back up and come back to what Matt was talking about earlier. It's really important to see that we continue to expect a similar growth tailwind from COVID in Q4 as we did in Q3, and we expect our base business to perform similarly or incrementally better. But it is important to keep in mind that we have 3 working days less, and particularly for these consumer-oriented businesses, that's pretty impactful in the calculation.
Now having said that, as you think about the bioprocesses industry today, already, these companies are producing vaccines. So if you think about Operation Warp Speed and where BARDA is involved, not only are the pharmaceutical companies producing clinical trials quantities, they're already ramping up capacities for those vaccines that they see -- vaccines and therapeutics that they see very near to approval and are hopeful for. And of course, this is financed oftentimes through the federal government, and so there's a great deal of aggressiveness there. 
And so that's already happening here at the back end of Q3, and you'll see that also in Q4. And then as approvals start coming in, and we're hopeful that, that happens at the end of the fourth quarter or in the first quarter, then I would expect to see an additional ramp there as well."

And now that some of the other businesses are contributing more, I think we're going to have a bit of a mix impact.
And then as you mentioned, the lower OpEx, less travel and trade shows is certainly a part of it. Things are sort of getting going again, as you saw with the growth rates. And then Rainer talked about the accelerated growth spend. We're going to do that in Q4. We've got some projects already that we've got underway. I think that will have an impact on it. 
And probably lastly, frankly, we're -- given where we have seen some of the growth, and we've got some pretty outstanding growth in, for example, Cytiva, for example, Cepheid, there is going to be some sort of year-end accruals, if you will, around bonuses and things like that, that will be a bit of a headwind year-over-year for us. So I think it probably moderates a little bit here as we get into Q4 from where we've been. But still feel -- even with that, I still think we're going to be able to put up some pretty good EPS growth there."

I'm just wondering if you can kind of raise the scope up a little bit higher and just help us think through ultimately like the addressable opportunity for Cytiva and Pall just given the magnitude of therapeutic and vaccine development that's ongoing. So it's nice that you've got the orders in hand, but kind of how big is the market, do you feel, that you're addressing as we look out for both vaccines and therapeutics related to COVID?"

It's so important to remember that there are very different types of vaccines. In fact, there are a number of unknowns here that still make very solid and defined projections pretty challenging. There's a lot of questions around which kinds of vaccines and therapeutics ultimately get approved. 
And we've seen more recently with Lilly and J&J that these approvals are not given. These are rigorous processes that these companies go through with the FDA. And there are a number of wild cards, including adverse reactions and so forth, that at any given time, can derail efforts that we think are very close to the finish line. So it's really important to understand that, prior to approval, picking what are the future ""winners"" is very difficult.
The other thing that's also hard is that these vaccines are produced in very different ways. While there are a number of similarities, how they're produced is very, very important in terms of the amount of doses that you get per batch, as an example, which can materially and by orders of magnitude change the kinds of inputs that are required for any production.
We also have a lot of questions around the number of doses. Is it going to be a onetime shot with a booster for life? Or is it going to be much like we've seen for influenza, an annual-type injection that everybody needs? These are big questions that, of course, affect any kind of estimates that you make. And then lastly, there's a great deal of discussion about to what degree will the population actually accept vaccines and use them and get vaccinated in order to get to that ultimate goal of herd immunity. 
So we see that it's very, very challenging to come to a good number there. But having said that, as we get closer here in the next month and perhaps a quarter or so, we'll start seeing approvals. We're very hopeful. And this picture will become much more clear as we get the data out of the clinical trials, know about doses, whether booster shots are required and that sort of thing.
And then I come back to what Matt said. If you look at the $1 billion that we have year-to-date in orders, we see that prior to FDA approval. So we certainly feel very positive about what the future holds here in the next year or so. But again, coming down to hardcore and highly defined numbers is tough."

So while Rainer is sort of talking about, you guys are talking about what's the opportunity as we go forward sort of longer term, anything that we have here in the short term in Q4 from an order perspective, we'll just keep adding to it. 
So sort of the near term, I think we still have some upside here as we get kind of into Q4 and then as the vaccines get approved and then as we start to learn some of these unknown variables that we can start to give you guys a bit better kind of a view of it. But so far, I think it gives you a frame of what we've got. We've got the Q4, how that plays out. And then as we know more, I think as we get into early next year, we'll probably have a better frame for you, hopefully, to get some clarity around that."

And then maybe just one more on Cepheid. I know you've kind of addressed it a couple of times, but I think there's, similarly, a moving target to figure out how testing evolves, particularly related to COVID as we get into 2021 with a vaccine and as potentially there's a lot more testing done in point of care, the kind of the rapid antigens and much cheaper, faster alternatives. 
So any way to give us just an early sneak kind of framework to think about how we should be contemplating Cepheid as we look out to '21 under some of those scenarios? Because I think you are in an interesting position where you're not the kind of batch-based slower PCR, so you kind of sit in between 2 different areas. So any color on that would be great."

A lot of people talk about the antigen test. And most of those are used in different care settings. 
Our -- the Cepheid solution, GeneXpert, that is used at the point of care in critical care environments and in the hospital when speed, workflow and accuracy really count. So those clinicians, on the basis of that test, are going to make call as to what therapy they prescribe. So it has to be right. It just has to be right. 
And so that's why the GeneXpert and the Cepheid testing approach is the gold standard. And that's why we see that really as a very, very durable testing modality that is at the right place, at the right time with the right answer at the right cost for the system. And we expect, independent of the number of infections that we see, other types of modalities really breathing either higher or lower, depending on the infection rate. But as you think about the point of care, hospitals in particular, and other point-of-care setting, that's where we see this gold standard, along with this multiplex 4-in-1 test, to have an extraordinary amount of durability. 
And we see that, right? And you see us continuing to ramp up from 6 million to 7 million; in the fourth quarter, 8 million. And you can expect more tests per quarter as we go through 2021. 
So I feel very strongly about the unique and durable positioning of our Cepheid GeneXpert approach. And add on top of that the fact that we've increased the installed base by 35% this year, that really puts us in a very strong position. And that installed base continues to grow."

One is I wonder if you could put more granularity on the growth in China, how it progressed through the quarter. And any areas of comparative strength and weakness? Acknowledging, of course, that it's all recovering right here. It would be helpful just to get that regional perspective and to the extent you're comfortable talking about where that might sit in 4Q.
And then I'll go ahead and ask my second question, which is actually on Beck Dx, which we haven't really touched on here in the Q&A. I wonder if you could talk about the capital side, what your expectations are. Given DxA is now available in some regions, I believe, how do you think about capital in Beck Dx prospectively?
And then to the extent that you have a window on it, given that you have that business and a broader diagnostics platform, how are you planning for the fourth quarter and next year as it relates to some of the specialty testing categories that are so important in hospital settings, both for this business and for just getting folks back into the hospital to get the kind of care they need, whether it's related to cardiovascular or other specialty settings?

China has been an extraordinary story, as you all know, in terms of the speed of the recovery. And what we see as unique with China is the breadth of that recovery. So not only do we see, of course, extraordinary return to lab capacities, which are nearly or at pre-pandemic levels, we also see the return of patient volumes, to some degree, approaching normality. 
And what's unique about China is that we also see this in our more industrial businesses. So the recovery in China, in contrast to North America and Western Europe, is broader-based. And so as you think about our EAS portfolio or some of the businesses we have -- industrial businesses we have with Pall, we're seeing very nice recoveries there. And like we said, in China, we saw essentially 10% growth here in Q3, and we expect to see acceleration of that here in Q4 as well as that economy continues to build momentum. And that's really across the portfolio.
Now as we think about Beckman Diagnostics and our business there, we're really pleased by the performance and the return of patient volumes here in the developed market. Those have really exceeded our expectations. And the team has done very, very well in continuing to grow that business, innovate in that business. You heard about the IL-6. You heard about IgM on top of IgG. And so we have a great deal of momentum here, and our innovation cycle times have been shortened and accelerated very significantly.
And as we think of capital, we're starting to see our funnel pick up in the discussion also around capital equipment placements. No doubt they are not yet at the level of what we saw prior to the pandemic, but they certainly are better than what we saw in Q2 and earlier in Q3. And so those conversations are starting to happen.
Also differently to what we saw in Q2, and this will be something to monitor as we see COVID hotspots continue to pop up around the world, is that for now we haven't seen anything but on the margin impacted in the patient volume returning, meaning that we've seen wellness testing and elective-type procedures continuing to ramp and not being significantly impacted yet by some of these hotspots. So cautiously optimistic here that the progression that we've seen for Beckman Diagnostics and more generally, with patient volumes continues to move forward positively."
