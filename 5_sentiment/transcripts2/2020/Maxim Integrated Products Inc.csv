We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with Automotive. In the December quarter, our Automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and Driver Assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall Automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications in power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the consumer electronics show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, Driver Assistance and Power Management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive sealing products, transport, video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for Advanced Driver Assistance systems.
In the March quarter, Automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate Automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by Driver Assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the December quarter, Industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss Communications and Data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks, need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, Consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for Consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we accept Consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have booked Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in Communications and data center, Industrial and Automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-life products in Automotive and Industrial. Our Analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of the forecast range entering the quarter.

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of the forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%. 
Our revenue mix by major market in Q2 was approximately 30% Industrial, 26% Automotive, 24% comms and Data Center and 20% Consumer.
Now let me turn to our Distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management, combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin. The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.7, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. 
Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability. Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect the range of $0.57 to $0.65. 
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth really end or demand driven growth in our Automotive products and in our optical products for both Data Center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our Customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2 year-ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory and distribution. That's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned in Automotive and comms Data Center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand.
And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your Auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think, China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products. Do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds?"

And also in ADAS, we have a lot of design wins we've had in the past few years, and those are ramping into production. So those 2 segments, we believe, we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally. A, because content growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper growth globally. So -- yes, we will grow. You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year, but long term, we do expect an Automotive to grow in the low teens."

So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 line by 25 transceiver I see plus some transplanted amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and, I guess, 4G installations that are printed 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think, we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think, these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with Automotive. In the December quarter, our Automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall Automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications in power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the consumer electronics show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive serial link products, transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems.
In the March quarter, Automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate Automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the December quarter, Industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the December quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and Data Center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the December quarter, Consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect Consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in Communications and Data Center, Industrial and Automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-lived products in Automotive and Industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%. 
Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30% Industrial, 26% Automotive, 24% Comms and Data Center and 20% Consumer.
Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management, combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin. The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. 
Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability. Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect the range of $0.57 to $0.65. 
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth really end or demand driven growth in our Automotive products and in our optical products for both Data Center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2 year-ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution, and that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned in Automotive and Comms Data Center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand.
And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your Auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think, China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products, do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds?"

So those 2 segments, we believe, we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content's growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper growth globally.

And we've got some good design wins in China OEMs, which I mentioned in the call. So there's some specific areas in Automotive that are doing really well for us. And as we had spoken last time, some of the slowing growth we saw in Automotive, we've attributed to maybe inventory digestion as car production slowed last year. So the fact that we're also believing that we're seeing that infotainment will be another growth.

One of them is in Data Center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution. And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at -- our customers and the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last 2 quarters. So that's the story there. I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 lane x 25 transceiver IC plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and, I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think, we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think, these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with automotive. In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications and power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the Consumer Electronics Show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive serial link products transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems.
In the March quarter, automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center, industrial and automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins in long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%.
Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30% industrial, 26% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 20% consumer.
Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.
The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability.
Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue.
And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%.
For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.57 to $0.65.
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

Number one, we have some good growth, really end market demand-driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2-year ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was, was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution? And that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned, in automotive and comms, data center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand. And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%.

So those 2 segments, we believe we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper-growth globally. So yes, we will grow. You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year, for the long term, we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens."

It's hard for us to really tell exactly when it will gain enough customer acceptance in terms of how robust it is as a complete system. But revenues from this are not on the horizon for multiple years.

One of them is in data center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution. And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers and the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last 2 quarters. So that's the story there. I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 lane x 25 transceiver IC plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

We've got good demand for our gaming products. But many of the other products really go into a seasonally weak period after the holiday season. So we're seeing that.

We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with automotive. In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications and power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the Consumer Electronics Show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive serial link products transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems.
In the March quarter, automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center, industrial and automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins in long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter.

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%.
Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30% industrial, 26% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 20% consumer.
Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.
The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability.
Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue.
And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%.
For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.57 to $0.65.
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth, really end market demand-driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2-year ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was, was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution? And that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned, in automotive and comms, data center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand. And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products, do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds?"

So those 2 segments, we believe we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper-growth globally. So yes, we will grow. You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year, for the long term, we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens."

One of them is in data center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution. And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers and the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last 2 quarters. So that's the story there. I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 lane x 25 transceiver IC plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

And we've been executing on that plan, executing on that plan. If you look at our guidance into the current quarter, basically, we have our large customer ramping a new flagship phone. We've got good demand for our gaming products. But many of the other products really go into a seasonally weak period after the holiday season. So we're seeing that. Our seasonality definitely is changing. And maybe it's already changed to be more heavier in Q1 than it used to be basically in our Q2 so -- in our Q3, sorry. So it's going to be heavier in the Q1 of the next fiscal year.
Now your question about it, are we seeing something that's particular to Maxim? Yes, our content has gone down at our largest customer. So you are seeing the effects of that. But we are seeing good demand from other customers, but it takes a while for this all to balance out."

We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with automotive. In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications and power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the Consumer Electronics Show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive serial link products transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems.
In the March quarter, automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center, industrial and automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%.
Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30% industrial, 26% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 20% consumer.
Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.
The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability.
Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue.
And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%.
For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.57 to $0.65.
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth, really end market demand-driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2-year ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was, was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution? And that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned, in automotive and comms, data center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand. And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products, do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds?"

And also in ADAS, we have a lot of design wins we've had in the past few years and those are ramping into production. So those 2 segments, we believe we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper-growth globally. So yes, we will grow. You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year, for the long term, we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens."

And we've got some good design wins in China OEMs, which I mentioned in the call. So there's some specific areas in automotive that are doing really well for us. And as we had spoken last time, some of the slowing growth we saw in automotive, we've attributed to maybe inventory digestion as car production slowed last year. So the fact that we're also believing that we're seeing that infotainment will be another growth.

One of them is in data center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution. And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers and the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last 2 quarters. So that's the story there. I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 lane x 25 transceiver IC plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's result",991,"Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines. However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners is currently operational without distance. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing related capacity constraints. Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate. 
Additionally, we are expediting product equipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our planning. Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis. 
Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market include the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially and with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect the June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter and place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications. 
Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures, resulting in lower demand, and given our test constraints, we anticipate our automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMS. Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the March quarter, industrial was flat from the prior quarter. We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted. Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after 
In the June quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance. Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved. Let me next discuss communications and data center. In the March quarter, comms and data center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook, computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters, as employees around the world adjust to remote work. We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. In the June quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year. We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth. 
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the March quarter, consumer was down 5% sequentially, with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments, more than offset by seasonal decline in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content. Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio. We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products, which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As Tunç mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products. 
Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% industrial, 28% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 18% consumer. 
Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3. We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As Tunç mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter. 
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. The this was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses. A portion of this decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow defined as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.74, and our free cash flow yield is 5% at  yesterday's closing stock price. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3 as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter. Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3, driven by our repurchase matrix, which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at [ 100 ] down 3 days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million. 
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter. We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of push-outs within this backlog, and we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue. During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. This Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57. 
In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times. We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers, while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

So in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So it gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products. We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters and disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings and pulled in. Essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them. In terms of the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catch-up that's going on. And in general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what -- we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So some of the group is fueled by these and high priority we're giving for medical. Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in the"

The recent data points out of third-party research guys like IHS and one of your semi peers that reported this morning is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and recently in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends? And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up. Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends?"

So one thing that I just recall, Ross asked the question -- 2-part question. I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get out Let me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So in 70%, I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So we're starting from a lower number. And we'll catch up by the end of the quarter. So I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix actually from customers. Some of them have begun to order, and you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely close. So they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area. And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So I think automotive, there's a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back, were being delayed. But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints. So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their Tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products, more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be in this quarter and maybe even next. Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean, we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So your other question was how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that. But I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help. First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. The automotive is both. It's both demand weakening and test both of them. And comms and data center is relatively unaffected by the constraint. So I think that it's kind of things are full.

A typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had again, given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance. The 1 thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So we've move to a practice where orders within 45 days are non cancelable and non reschedulable. So that gives us a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance. But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have supply dynamics here that are constrained the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand, and the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to correlations to prior downturns."

There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well. As Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue. But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic caused recession that came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within -- I remember, within a year, we had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or 5 quarters. So what we're doing is we don't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter in place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So in terms of our ability to ship our supply chain and so on, we're really preparing for a quick recovery. We are built to be resilient. I mean, we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products, the flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall. And we will continue to be careful on spending. I think that is also important. But we essentially are preparing so that we are ready for a quicker recovery of the semiconductor business compared to what might happen in the overall economy."

They don't really share that with us. We do ask the questions about inventory levels. But the fact that -- not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products, we were also limited by test countries, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market. And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth in design wins, in particular segments that we're doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market. Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen.

Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption of our guidance that we would replenish the to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there. As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, 50 days, up just 1 day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter. But it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. Your question about -- so what's the -- what are we assuming moving into the quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that. Again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus channel shipments. So I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will. But I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict exactly where days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties."

So let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add it have gross margin effects. You can add to that. So in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape. So we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected. We've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So assembly, in general, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures. In final test, we really have 2 internal sources and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. And in the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandated by the government. So our plan is really to increase the level of staffing. And also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees. We're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect probably by the end of the quarter to get back to the levels that we're running at and doing some catch-up as well. So it is really a number of staff that can get to the factory, and it's not really related to equipment and so on. So hopefully, that answered most of your questions, was that sufficient?

So as you summarized, we have a nice robust good growth business on the hyperscale side, that consists of products we make for -- primarily most of the growth there is coming from our optical products. These customers are investing in their data centers, and they need to connect their high speed connector servers and storage together, and our products help do that inside of the data center. So that's pretty robust growth. And the signals we're getting at the moment from them is that their investments are going to continue. We -- this quarter, the addition was that we began to ramp some power products for these high-powered server applications. So that also should help essentially our power products and enterprise and data center had been weak for multiple years, and this is the initial ramp that we're seeing, at least from that 1 customer. So that -- those 2 added should really help us grow. In our market, it seems like the world has continued to invest in, which is data center and cloud. On the base station side, rollouts are continuing on our single lane in 25G transceiver products are well accepted in the market. But that piece will be lumpy. And I think that we ramped it very nicely throughout last year, will be a little bit of a decline probably this quarter as things kind of stabilize in that market. But I think there's no question in our minds that, overall, for the future, the upgrading of base stations are going to continue. But that business has always been lumpy and will continue to be so. So I wouldn't really directed to keep growing at the rate that it has grown, let's say, in the last year."

Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's resu",989,"Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines. However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. 
We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners, is currently operational without disruptions. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing-related capacity constraints. Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate.
Additionally, we are expediting product equipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our test planning. Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis.
Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market includes the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially, with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect that June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications.
Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures, resulting in lower demand, and given our test constraints, we anticipate our automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMS. 
Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the March quarter, Industrial was flat from the prior quarter. We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted. Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after me.
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance. Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved.
Let me next discuss communications and data center. In the March quarter, comms and data center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters, as employees around the world adjust to remote work. We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. 
In the June quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year. We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth.
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the March quarter, consumer was down 5% sequentially, with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments, more than offset by seasonal declines in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content. Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. 
I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio. We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products, which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As Tunç mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products.
Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% industrial, 28% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 18% consumer.
Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3. We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As Tunç mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. This was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses. A portion of this decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.74, and our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter. Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3, driven by our repurchase matrix, which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at 106 down 3 days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter. We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of push-outs within this backlog, and we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue.
During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. Fiscal Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57.
In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times. We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers, while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

So in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So it gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products. We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters and disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings and pulled in. So essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them.
In terms of the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catch-up that's going on. And in general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what -- we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So some of the group is fueled by these pull ins and high priority we're giving for medical. Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in this environment."

And then for my main question in automotive, the recent data points out of third-party research guys like IHS and one of your semi-peers that reported this morning is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and recently in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends? 
And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up. Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends?"

Let me a",614,"Okay, Harlan, I'll take that. That was a lot of questions in here. So one thing that I just recalled, Ross asked the question, it's a 2-part question, I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get better. Let me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So in 70%, I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So we're starting from a lower number. And we'll catch up by the end of the quarter. So I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. 
In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix actually from customers. Some of them have begun to order, and you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely close. So they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area. And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So I think automotive, there's a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back or being delayed. 
But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints. So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their Tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be weakness in this quarter and maybe even next. Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
So your other question was how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that. But I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help. First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think the industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. But automotive is both. It's both demand weakening and test constraints, both of them. And comms and data center is relatively unaffected by the constraint. 
So I think that it's kind of things are fluid, that's why we're kind of hesitating from giving actual numbers as to what revenue could have been if we [ add ] all the test constraints because as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the backlog we have, we're suspecting that as the quarter goes on, some of that might be pushed out of the quarter as well. So it's a bit of a mix for that reason."

So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had again, given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. 
As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance, the 1 thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So we've moved to a practice where orders within 45 days are noncancelable and nonreschedulable. So that gives us a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance.
But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have supply dynamics here that are constraining the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand. And the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to draw correlations to prior downturns."

There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well, as Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue. But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic caused recession that came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within -- I remember, within a year, we had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or 5 quarters.
So what we're doing is we can't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter-in-place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So in terms of our ability to ship, our supply chain and so on, we're really preparing for a quick recovery. 
We are built to be resilient. I mean we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products, the flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall. And we will continue to be careful on spending. I think that is also important. But we essentially are preparing so that we are ready for a quicker recovery of the semiconductor business compared to what might happen in the overall economy."

They don't really share that with us. We do ask the questions about inventory levels. But the fact that -- and not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products, we were also limited by test constraints, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market. And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth and design wins, in particular segments that we're doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market.
Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen. And therefore, we laid out a more cautious outlook on what's going to happen in automotive with a pretty serious decline that we're forecasting in current quarter we're in."

Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption in our guidance that we would replenish the channel to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there. As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, 50 days, up just 1 day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter. But it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. 
Your question about -- so what's the -- what are we assuming moving into the current quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that. Again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus channel shipments.
So I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will. But I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict exactly where days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties."

So let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add, if gross margin affects, he can add to that. So in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape. So we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected, we've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So assembly, in general, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures.
In final test, we really have 2 internal sources and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. And in the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we can't get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandated by the government. So our plan is really to increase the level of staffing, and also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. 
And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees, we're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect probably by the end of the quarter to get back to the levels that we were running at and doing some catch-up as well. So it is really a number of staff that can get to the factory, and it's not really related to equipment and so on. So hopefully, that answered most of your questions, was that sufficient?

On the base station side, rollouts are continuing and our single lane 25G transceiver products are well accepted in the market. But that piece will be lumpy. And I think that we ramped it very nicely throughout last year. There will be a little bit of a decline probably this quarter as things kind of stabilize in that market. But I think there's no question in our minds that, overall, for the future, the upgrading of base stations are going to continue. But that business has always been lumpy and will continue to be so. So I wouldn't really direct it to keep growing at the rate that it has grown, let's say, in the last year."

Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's resu",989,"Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines. However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. 
We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners, is currently operational without disruptions. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing-related capacity constraints. Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate.
Additionally, we are expediting product shipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our test planning. Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis.
Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market includes the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with Automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially, with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect that June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications.
Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures resulting in lower demand and given our test constraints, we anticipate our Automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMs. 
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the March quarter, Industrial was flat from the prior quarter. We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted. Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after me.
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance. Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters, as employees around the world adjust to remote work. We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. 
In the June quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and Data Center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year. We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, Consumer was down 5% sequentially, with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments more than offset by seasonal declines in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content. Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. 
I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio. We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products, which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As Tunç mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products.
Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% Industrial, 28% Automotive, 24% Comms and Data Center and 18% Consumer.
Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3. We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As Tunç mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. This was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses. A portion of this decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.74, and our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter. Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3, driven by our repurchase matrix, which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at 106 down 3 days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter. We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of push-outs within this backlog, and we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue.
During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. Fiscal Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57.
In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times. We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers, while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

So in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So it gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products. We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters and disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings and pulled in. So essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them.
In terms of the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catch-up that's going on. And in general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what -- we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So some of the group is fueled by these pull-ins and high priority we're giving for medical. Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in this environment."

Maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You guys talked about test capacity constraints in June.

And then for my main question in automotive, the recent data points out of third-party research guys like IHS and one of your semi-peers, they reported this morning, is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and recently in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends? 
And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up. Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends?"

Let me",612,"Okay, Harlan, I'll take that. That was a lot of questions in there. So one thing that I just recalled, Ross asked the question, it's a 2-part question, I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get better. Let me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So the 70% I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So we're starting from a lower number. And we'll catch up by the end of the quarter. So I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. 
In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix actually from customers. Some of them have begun to order, and you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely closed. So they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area. And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So I think automotive, there's a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back or being delayed. 
But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints. So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their Tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be weakness in this quarter and maybe even next. Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
So your other question was how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that. But I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help. First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think the industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. But automotive is both. It's both demand weakening and test constraints, both of them. And comms and data center is relatively unaffected by the constraint. 
So I think that it's kind of things are fluid, that's why we're kind of hesitating from giving actual numbers as to what revenue could have been if we had all the test constraints because as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the backlog we have, we're suspecting that as the quarter goes on, some of that might be pushed out of the quarter as well. So it's a bit of a mix for that reason."

I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance",250,"Sure. This is Brian. I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had again, given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. 
As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance, the one thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So we've moved to a practice where orders within 45 days are noncancelable and nonreschedulable. So that gives us a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance.
But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have supply dynamics here that are constraining the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand. And the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to draw correlations to prior downturns."

There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well. As Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue. But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic-caused recession that came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within, I remember, within a year. We had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or 5 quarters.
So what we're doing is we can't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter-in-place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So in terms of our ability to ship, our supply chain and so on, we're really preparing for a quick recovery. We are built to be resilient. I mean we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products. The flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall.

They don't really share that with us. We do ask the questions about inventory levels. But the fact that -- and not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products, we were also limited by test constraints, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market. And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth and design wins, in particular segments that we're doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market.
Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen. And therefore, we laid out a more cautious outlook on what's going to happen in automotive with a pretty serious decline that we're forecasting in current quarter we're in."

Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption in our guidance that we would replenish the channel to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there. As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, 50 days, up just 1 day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter. But it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. 
Your question about -- so what's the -- what are we assuming moving into the current quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that. Again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus channel shipments.
So I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will. But I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict exactly where our days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties."

So let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add. If gross margin affects, he can add to that. So in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape. So we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected, we've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So assembly, in general, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures.
In final test, we really have 2 internal sources and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. And in the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we can't get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandated by the government. So our plan is really to increase the level of staffing, and also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. 
And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees, we're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect probably by the end of the quarter to get back to the levels that we were running at and doing some catch-up as well. So it is really a number of staff that can get to the factory, and it's not really related to equipment and so on. So hopefully, that answered most of your questions. Was that sufficient?

We -- this quarter, the addition was that we began to ramp some power products for these high-powered server applications.

So that -- those 2 added should really help us grow. In our market, it seems like the world has continued to invest, which is data center and cloud. 
On the base station side, rollouts are continuing and our single lane 25G transceiver products are well accepted in the market. But that piece will be lumpy.

Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's resu",989,"Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines. However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. 
We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners, is currently operational without disruptions. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing-related capacity constraints. Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate.
Additionally, we are expediting product shipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our test planning. Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis.
Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market includes the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with Automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially, with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect that June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications.
Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures resulting in lower demand and given our test constraints, we anticipate our Automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMs. 
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the March quarter, Industrial was flat from the prior quarter. We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted. Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after me.
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance. Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters, as employees around the world adjust to remote work. We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. 
In the June quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and Data Center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year. We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, Consumer was down 5% sequentially, with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments more than offset by seasonal declines in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content. Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. 
I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio. We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products, which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As Tunç mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products.
Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% Industrial, 28% Automotive, 24% Comms and Data Center and 18% Consumer.
Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3. We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As Tunç mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. This was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses. A portion of this decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.74, and our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter. Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3, driven by our repurchase matrix, which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at 106 down 3 days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter. We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of push-outs within this backlog, and we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue.
During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. Fiscal Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57.
In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times. We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers, while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

So in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So it gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products. We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters and disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings and pulled in. So essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them.
In terms of the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catch-up that's going on. And in general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what -- we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So some of the group is fueled by these pull-ins and high priority we're giving for medical. Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in this environment."

Maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You guys talked about test capacity constraints in June. Maybe how much of the revenue impact -- how much of a revenue impact is that having on the June quarter? And then for my main question in automotive, the recent data points out of third-party research guys like IHS and one of your semi-peers, they reported this morning, is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and recently in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends? 
And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up. Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends?"

Let me",612,"Okay, Harlan, I'll take that. That was a lot of questions in there. So one thing that I just recalled, Ross asked the question, it's a 2-part question, I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get better. Let me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So the 70% I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So we're starting from a lower number. And we'll catch up by the end of the quarter. So I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. 
In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix actually from customers. Some of them have begun to order, and you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely closed. So they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area. And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So I think automotive, there's a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back or being delayed. 
But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints. So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their Tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be weakness in this quarter and maybe even next. Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
So your other question was how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that. But I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help. First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think the industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. But automotive is both. It's both demand weakening and test constraints, both of them. And comms and data center is relatively unaffected by the constraint. 
So I think that it's kind of things are fluid, that's why we're kind of hesitating from giving actual numbers as to what revenue could have been if we had all the test constraints because as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the backlog we have, we're suspecting that as the quarter goes on, some of that might be pushed out of the quarter as well. So it's a bit of a mix for that reason."

I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance",250,"Sure. This is Brian. I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had again, given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. 
As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance, the one thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So we've moved to a practice where orders within 45 days are noncancelable and nonreschedulable. So that gives us a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance.
But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have supply dynamics here that are constraining the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand. And the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to draw correlations to prior downturns."

There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well. As Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue. But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic-caused recession that came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within, I remember, within a year. We had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or 5 quarters.
So what we're doing is we can't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter-in-place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So in terms of our ability to ship, our supply chain and so on, we're really preparing for a quick recovery. We are built to be resilient. I mean we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products. The flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall. And we will continue to be careful on spending. I think that is also important. But we essentially are preparing so that we are ready for a quicker recovery of the semiconductor business compared to what might happen in the overall economy."

But the fact that -- and not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products, we were also limited by test constraints, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market. And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth and design wins, in particular segments that we're doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market.
Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen. And therefore, we laid out a more cautious outlook on what's going to happen in automotive with a pretty serious decline that we're forecasting in current quarter we're in."

Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption in our guidance that we would replenish the channel to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there. As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, 50 days, up just 1 day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter. But it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. 
Your question about -- so what's the -- what are we assuming moving into the current quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that. Again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus channel shipments.
So I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will. But I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict exactly where our days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties."

So let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add. If gross margin affects, he can add to that. So in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape. So we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected, we've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So assembly, in general, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures.
In final test, we really have 2 internal sources and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. And in the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we can't get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandated by the government. So our plan is really to increase the level of staffing, and also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. 
And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees, we're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect probably by the end of the quarter to get back to the levels that we were running at and doing some catch-up as well. So it is really a number of staff that can get to the factory, and it's not really related to equipment and so on. So hopefully, that answered most of your questions. Was that sufficient? Or is there any other detail you're looking for?"

These customers are investing in their data centers, and they need to connect -- their high speed to connect their servers and storage together, and our products help do that inside of the data center. So that's pretty robust growth. And the signals we're getting at the moment from them is that their investments are going to continue. 
We -- this quarter, the addition was that we began to ramp some power products for these high-powered server applications. So that also should help essentially our power products, and enterprise and data center had been weak for multiple years. And this is the initial ramp that we're seeing at least from that 1 customer. So that -- those 2 added should really help us grow. In our market, it seems like the world has continued to invest, which is data center and cloud. 
On the base station side, rollouts are continuing and our single lane 25G transceiver products are well accepted in the market. But that piece will be lumpy. And I think that we ramped it very nicely throughout last year. There will be a little bit of a decline probably this quarter as things kind of stabilize in that market. But I think there's no question in our minds that, overall, for the future, the upgrading of base stations are going to continue. But that business has always been lumpy and will continue to be so.

We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.
Our December quarter results met our expectations, while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving.
Let me provide some color by end market, starting with automotive. In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production.
We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications and power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the Consumer Electronics Show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions.
Our latest generation automotive serial link products transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second. In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems.
In the March quarter, automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.
In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment, financial terminals and core industrial, including factory automation.
Now let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially. We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.
In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer CapEx deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.
Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was down 15% sequentially, with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be flat sequentially. Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year.
To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center, industrial and automotive. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was",632,"Thanks, Tunç, and thank you to everyone on the call today. Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%.
Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30% industrial, 26% automotive, 24% comms and data center and 20% consumer.
Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability.
Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.
The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year.
GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down 6 days from Q1, and inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter at the midpoint on higher revenue.
Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability.
Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue.
And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%.
For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.57 to $0.65.
In summary, we're pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth, really end market demand-driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G. So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth.
On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like 2-year ago levels, but both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year. So what we're seeing there is  reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel. So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was, was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution? And that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned, in automotive and comms, data center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand. And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece."

It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%. This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products, do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds?"

And also in ADAS, we have a lot of design wins we've had in the past few years and those are ramping into production. So those 2 segments, we believe we're going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently. So it's really hard to exactly predict, but I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for 2 of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it in hyper-growth globally. So yes, we will grow. You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year, for the long term, we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens."

So the fact that we're also believing that we're seeing that infotainment will be another growth.

One of them is in data center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution. And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers and the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last 2 quarters. So that's the story there. I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that. So it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year.
On the 25G front, it's 1 lane x 25 transceiver IC plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module. So it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations. And that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked. And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy. And right now, we're enjoying a good spot, but those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get these lumpiness, I think these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless."

So just to remind everybody, I mean, our consumer business, if you walk back a few years ago, was pretty concentrated on one, our largest customer. Our strategy has been for multiple years to diversify the business to go into multiple other customers as well as other markets, even if the same customers. And we've been executing on that plan, executing on that plan. If you look at our guidance into the current quarter, basically, we have our large customer ramping a new flagship phone. We've got good demand for our gaming products. But many of the other products really go into a seasonally weak period after the holiday season. So we're seeing that. Our seasonality definitely is changing. And maybe it's already changed to be more heavier in Q1 than it used to be basically in our Q2 so -- in our Q3, sorry. So it's going to be heavier in the Q1 of the next fiscal year.
Now your question about it, are we seeing something that's particular to Maxim? Yes, our content has gone down at our largest customer. So you are seeing the effects of that. But we are seeing good demand from other customers, but it takes a while for this all to balance out."

Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's resu",989,"Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. 
Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last 2 weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines. However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. 
We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners, is currently operational without disruptions. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing-related capacity constraints. Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate.
Additionally, we are expediting product shipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our test planning. Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis.
Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market includes the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with Automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially, with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect that June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications.
Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures resulting in lower demand and given our test constraints, we anticipate our Automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMs. 
Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the March quarter, Industrial was flat from the prior quarter. We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last 2 weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted. Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after me.
In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance. Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved.
Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the March quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters, as employees around the world adjust to remote work. We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. 
In the June quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and Data Center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year. We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth.
Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the March quarter, Consumer was down 5% sequentially, with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments more than offset by seasonal declines in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content. Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. 
I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio. We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products, which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Brian."

I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As TunÃ§ mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products.
Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% Industrial, 28% Automotive, 24% Comms and Data Center and 18% Consumer.
Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3. We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up 1 day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As TunÃ§ mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter.
Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. This was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses. A portion of this decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. 
Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range.
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.74, and our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. 
For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter. Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3, driven by our repurchase matrix, which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. 
Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at 106 down 3 days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million.
Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter. We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of push-outs within this backlog, and we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. 
Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue.
During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. Fiscal Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57.
In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times. We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers, while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy."

So in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So it gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products. We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters and disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings and pulled in. So essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them.
In terms of the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catch-up that's going on. And in general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what -- we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So some of the group is fueled by these pull-ins and high priority we're giving for medical. Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in this environment."

Maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You guys talked about test capacity constraints in June.

And then for my main question in automotive, the recent data points out of third-party research guys like IHS and one of your semi-peers, they reported this morning, is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and recently in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends? 
And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up. Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends?"

Let me",612,"Okay, Harlan, I'll take that. That was a lot of questions in there. So one thing that I just recalled, Ross asked the question, it's a 2-part question, I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get better. Let me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So the 70% I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So we're starting from a lower number. And we'll catch up by the end of the quarter. So I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. 
In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix actually from customers. Some of them have begun to order, and you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely closed. So they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area. And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So I think automotive, there's a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back or being delayed. 
But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints. So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their Tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be weakness in this quarter and maybe even next. Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. 
So your other question was how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that. But I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help. First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think the industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. But automotive is both. It's both demand weakening and test constraints, both of them. And comms and data center is relatively unaffected by the constraint. 
So I think that it's kind of things are fluid, that's why we're kind of hesitating from giving actual numbers as to what revenue could have been if we had all the test constraints because as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the backlog we have, we're suspecting that as the quarter goes on, some of that might be pushed out of the quarter as well. So it's a bit of a mix for that reason."

I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance",250,"Sure. This is Brian. I'll take that one. So if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter. So clearly, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had again, given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. 
As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance, the one thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So we've moved to a practice where orders within 45 days are noncancelable and nonreschedulable. So that gives us a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance.
But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have supply dynamics here that are constraining the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand. And the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to draw correlations to prior downturns."

There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well. As Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue. But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic-caused recession that came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within, I remember, within a year. We had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or 5 quarters.
So what we're doing is we can't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter-in-place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So in terms of our ability to ship, our supply chain and so on, we're really preparing for a quick recovery. We are built to be resilient. I mean we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products. The flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall. And we will continue to be careful on spending. I think that is also important. But we essentially are preparing so that we are ready for a quicker recovery of the semiconductor business compared to what might happen in the overall economy."

They don't really share that with us. We do ask the questions about inventory levels. But the fact that -- and not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products, we were also limited by test constraints, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market. And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth and design wins, in particular segments that we're doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market.
Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen. And therefore, we laid out a more cautious outlook on what's going to happen in automotive with a pretty serious decline that we're forecasting in current quarter we're in."

Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption in our guidance that we would replenish the channel to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there. As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, 50 days, up just 1 day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter. But it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. 
Your question about -- so what's the -- what are we assuming moving into the current quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that. Again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus channel shipments.
So I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will. But I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict exactly where our days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties."

So let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add. If gross margin affects, he can add to that. So in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape. So we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected, we've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So assembly, in general, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures.
In final test, we really have 2 internal sources and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. And in the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we can't get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandated by the government. So our plan is really to increase the level of staffing, and also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. 
And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees, we're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect probably by the end of the quarter to get back to the levels that we were running at and doing some catch-up as well.

But how do you guys get comfortable around what is demand erosion? What is just supply constraints?

We really have our focus on the long term in terms of our investments, especially in R&D. And we have a pretty flexible supply chain. So we should be able to react, whether there's a quick recovery in '21 or if there isn't. Then because of the flexible chain, we don't have a huge dependence on gross margin and the level of revenue. So I think we should be -- we're well prepared for any eventuality that occurs out there."

So as you summarized, we have a nice robust good growth business on the hyperscale side, that consists of products we make for -- primarily most of the growth there is coming from our optical products. These customers are investing in their data centers, and they need to connect -- their high speed to connect their servers and storage together, and our products help do that inside of the data center. So that's pretty robust growth. And the signals we're getting at the moment from them is that their investments are going to continue. 
We -- this quarter, the addition was that we began to ramp some power products for these high-powered server applications. So that also should help essentially our power products, and enterprise and data center had been weak for multiple years. And this is the initial ramp that we're seeing at least from that 1 customer. So that -- those 2 added should really help us grow. In our market, it seems like the world has continued to invest, which is data center and cloud. 
On the base station side, rollouts are continuing and our single lane 25G transceiver products are well accepted in the market. But that piece will be lumpy. And I think that we ramped it very nicely throughout last year. There will be a little bit of a decline probably this quarter as things kind of stabilize in that market. But I think there's no question in our minds that, overall, for the future, the upgrading of base stations are going to continue. But that business has always been lumpy and will continue to be so. So I wouldn't really direct it to keep growing at the rate that it has grown, let's say, in the last year."
