We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute well. Specifically, sales increased 12% behind strong volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments. EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 17%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%. And in the first half of the year, we generated $345 million of cash flow from operations. Because of our strong year-to-date results and good operating momentum, we've raised our fiscal 2020 outlook for both sales and EBITDA. As Dexter mentioned, I'd like to update you on some capital allocation actions we've recently taken as well as our thoughts on the potato crop in the current operating environment. 
On capital allocation. In October, we acquired a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture in Argentina. This JV will provide us better access to a strategic and growing market where we have been underrepresented. Before this investment, our market share in South America was less than 2%. While the JV is a modest size operation today, it provides a good base for expansion to serve the broader South American market with a low-cost, high-quality product. This should enable us to drive faster share growth over the long term. We also remain committed to reinvesting capital back in this business to support customer growth. We have added 3 new French since 2014. And despite these additions, our current capacity utilization is above our targeted operating rates due to recent demand growth being faster than historical averages. While we are not prepared to announce any capacity expansion projects today, we are aggressively evaluating opportunities to expand production capacity inside and outside North America to support our customers' growth. We look forward to sharing our expansion plans with you soon. 
In the meantime, we're actively working to stretch existing capacity by debottlenecking lines and driving productivity. 
And finally, in addition to reinvesting back into the business, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.23 a share or $0.92 on an annual basis. That puts our dividend payout ratio at about 27% on a latest 12-month basis, which is within our target payout range of 25% to 35%. We will continue to supplement our dividends with share repurchases. In the second quarter, we bought back about $8.5 million of stock, which is largely consistent with our goal to at least offset equity compensation dilution. To do so, we estimate that we need to buy back around $40 million of stock annually. 
Now switching to the potato crop. Recent press reports have led to market fears of raw potato and French fry shortages. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will resource the vast majority of our raw potatoes and where we have most of our production facilities is consistent with historical averages in terms of both yield and quality. As a result, we expect to operate our plants there at normal utilization rates. 
In Alberta, Canada, where we have 1 plant, crop yields and quality are below average as a result of adverse weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. However, we've been able to secure enough potatoes to operate that plant at normal rates. Nonetheless, overall potato availability in Alberta is limited. 
In Minnesota, where we have a single plant through our joint venture, Lamb Weston RDO, crop yields and quality are below average, also due to poor weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. As a result, potato availability in the upper Midwest will also be limited. However, our partner in that plant is the primary player of raw potatoes, and they expect to provide adequate supply for the plant to operate as planned. 
Also, we understand that the crops and other key growing regions, such as Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, are below average due to adverse weather. This limits the availability of potatoes in North America. It's important to note that we do not currently source raw potatoes from these regions. So let me be clear. Given our concentration of processing facilities in the Columbia Basin in Idaho as well as our strong grower relationships in Alberta and the Midwest, and most importantly, our decision to source open potato several months ago, we're confident that we have raw potatoes to deliver our volume growth targets for the remainder of our fiscal year. However, potato supply in North America is tight, and this may pressure our ability to pursue incremental volume growth opportunities both domestically and internationally for this crop year. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve price and mix in each of our business segments. 
Now turning to Europe. The potato supply there is also expected to be challenging due to quality and late harvest weather conditions. Compared to last year's historically poor harvest, the potato crops in the Netherlands and Belgium this year are better, but still below average. The crops in Germany, Poland and the U.K. are more challenged. As a result, raw potato prices in Europe remain elevated versus historical averages, but are below prices that we experienced last year. So we expect that lamb Weston Myer's performance will continue to improve compared to last year as cost pressures ease in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the new crop. 
With respect to the operating environment. We believe that industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the second quarter, and they will likely remain so for the remainder of our fiscal year subject to raw potato availability. We believe global demand growth, frozen potato products is generally favorable and will remain so through fiscal 2020. Similar to what we saw earlier in the year, U.S. demand in the second quarter continued to be underpinned by positive restaurant traffic trends and quick-service traffic growth was strong, again, led by growth at chicken-based outlets. Demand in our key international markets as well as in Europe, continued to grow in line with recent trends. Together, these factors helped drive our strong volume growth in the quarter, especially in our Global segment. So in summary, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half results. We expect the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable for the balance of the year, underpinned by solid demand growth. We are well positioned with raw potatoes to deliver our volume targets. And finally, our successful execution of our strategy is generating strong cash flows, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to support growth and step up cash return to shareholders. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook."

As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1,019 million, with volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments. Volume increased 10%, led by growth in our Global and Foodservice segments. Our 2 acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals, added out 1.5 points of volume growth. In addition, we had a couple of extra shipping days than we had in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the timing of Thanksgiving. These extra couple of days contribute about another plenty of volume growth. As a result, this will pose a headwind to our Q3 results on a year-over-year basis. Price/mix was up 2% due to pricing actions and favorable mix. 
Our strong sales growth drove a $36 million or 14% increase in gross profit. Favorable price/mix, volume growth, along with lower transportation costs drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston. In addition, the increase in gross profit included a $4 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts. That's compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage increased about 65 basis points to 28%. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was up about 5 points. While we made a lot of progress improving our planned operating performance from the first quarter, in the second quarter, we continued to incur higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtimes, which affected our production levels. This impacted fixed cost absorption, raised overall maintenance cost and lowered recovery rates. In addition, some of the cost that we realized in the second quarter was a carryover effect as we work through finished goods inventories from the first quarter. Since our plants are now operating at more normal levels, we expect only a modest carryover effect from these manufacturing efficiencies in our fiscal third quarter results. SG&A expense was $92 million, an increase of about $17 million. About $6 million of this increase was related to higher incentive compensation accruals based primarily on our performance. About $4 million of the change reflects an insurance settlement that we had last year, but this was partially offset by a $2 million reduction in foreign exchange losses. About $7 million of the increase related to investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. 
Finally, more than $2 million of the increase was related to designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. As we previously discussed, we expect to spend about $10 million to $20 million of one-time costs this year on implementing a new ERP system. To date, we've spent about $4 million, so we expect spending to ramp up in the second half of the year. 
Income from operations increased about $20 million, or 11%, to $194 million. This reflected solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston Myer in Europe, Lamb Weston RDO in Minnesota and our new joint venture in Argentina were $15 million in the quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $6 million, largely reflecting lower raw potato prices in Europe. 
So putting it all together, EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $38 million, or 17%, to $261 million. Operating gains by our base business, along with contributions from the BSW consolidation in the Australian acquisitions, drove about $32 million of EBITDA growth. Our unconsolidated joint ventures added about $6 million. 
Moving down the income statement. Interest expense was about $25 million, which is about $1 million below last year. Our effective tax rate was more than 23% or about 2 points higher than last year due to discrete items. 
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.15, or 19%, to $0.95. Operating gains in our base business and higher earnings drove the increase. We also had an approximately $0.04 benefit from the BSW consolidation. 
Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based change as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 15%. Volume grew 14%. The increase was driven by higher sales, including increased sales of limited time offerings to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a 3-point benefit from the acquisitions in Australia and a 1-point benefit from the additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving. Price/mix rose 1%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multiyear contracts. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less advertising and promotion expense, increased $17 million or 15%. Volume growth, favorable price/mix and lower transportation costs drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and higher depreciation expense associated with the Hermiston line. Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 9%. Volume increased 5%, led by growth of distributor private label and Lamb Weston branded products. About half of the volume increase was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Even after adjusting for the Thanksgiving shift, we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth as our direct sales force continued to strengthen customer relationships. Price/mix increased 4%, primarily reflecting pricing actions taken in October. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $14 million or 14%. Favorable price/mix, volume growth and lower transportation costs more than offset higher manufacturing cost and depreciation expense. Sales in our Retail segment increased 7%, driven by 4 points of volume growth behind increased sales of branded and private label products. About 2 points of the volume growth was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Price/mix increased 2% -- 3%, excuse me, largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $3 million or 10%. Favorable price/mix and volume growth drove the increase, and was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost, depreciation expense and A&P spending. 
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.6x. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $345 million of cash from operations in the first half of the year. That's up about 9% versus last year, driven by our earnings growth. We used about $135 million towards acquisitions, including a $17 million initial payment for our half of the new joint venture in Argentina. We also invested nearly $110 million combined in capital expenditures and IT-related projects. 
In addition, we bought back more than $13 million of stock and paid $59 million in dividends to our shareholders. 
Turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. As Tom noted, because of our first -- strong first half performance, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. As a reminder, our targets include the contribution of a 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to be prudent when updating our annual outlook. For the full year, we're now targeting sales to grow at the high end of our original mid- to high single-digit rate range. We continue to expect that sales will be primarily driven by volume, and it will deliver price/mix increases to offset input cost inflation. As you know, we delivered 10% sales growth in the first half, including a 2% higher price/mix and robust 8% volume growth. We expect our volume growth will moderate in the second half for a number of reasons. In our Global segment, volume growth in the first half of the year was faster than we had anticipated due to domestic QSR traffic growth above historical trends, and international demand was also above our initial expectations. While we expect global demand will remain generally favorable in the back half of the year, we expect these trends may begin to normalize towards historical growth rates. 
Also in our Global segment, in the third quarter, we'll be lapping strong sales of limited time offering products. Also in the third quarter, we realized a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point due to a lower number of shipping days versus the prior year quarter as a result of the timing of Thanksgiving. This will affect each of our core business segments, with the most pronounced impact in our Foodservice segment. 
Finally, in our Retail segment, we'll realize the effect of losing some low-margin contracts in our private label retail business. 
In short, we expect to drive solid sales growth in the second half, led primarily by volume growth with modestly higher price/mix. For earnings, we've increased our full year target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures to a range of $965 million to $985 million. That's up from a range of $950 million to $970 million. For the second half, we expect that gross profit will rise largely in line with sales growth, with volume growth and favorable price/mix offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. As a result, we expect that gross margin percentage will be essentially flat in the second half. However, gross margin in the third quarter may be pressured as a result of difficult prior year comparison. Gross margin in the third quarter fiscal 2019 included a $4 million benefit from unrealized gains on hedging contracts, a mix benefit due to strong sales of higher-margin limited time offering products in our Global segment and a cost benefit from supply chain efficiencies, especially around edible oils and transportation. Regarding SG&A. For the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising promotional expenses as well as onetime ERP investments will be within our target range of 8% to 8.5% of sales. A&P expense in the second half should be a bit above the $11 million we've spent so far. As I previously noted, we anticipate total ERP system implementation spending to ramp up versus the $4 million of onetime expense that we incurred in the first half. We continue to target total onetime expenses related to the project between $10 million and $20 million for the full year. 
With respect to equity earnings, we continue to expect that it will continue to gradually improve in the second half despite the potato crop in Europe, again, being somewhat challenged. 
To summarize, in the second half of the year, we'll deliver solid growth in EBITDA, including joint ventures, driven by sales and gross profit growth as well as improved equity earnings. This growth will be tempered by higher SG&A expense as we step up spending behind our ERP implementation. In addition, it's important to note that we had an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2019 -- 2020, excuse me. Since we completed that transaction around mid-fiscal 2019, we'll no longer have that benefit in the back half of this fiscal year. 
Finally, most of our other financial targets remain the same. We continue to target total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million and total capital expenditures, which includes some CapEx for our new ERP system of around $300 million. We've updated our effective tax rate target to be about 24%. That's on the high end of our previous estimate of 23% to 24%. 
Now back to Tom for some closing comments."

As Dexter mentioned, I'd like to update you on some capital allocation actions we've recently taken as well as our thoughts on the potato crop in the current operating environment.
On capital allocation. In October, we acquired a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture in Argentina. This JV will provide us better access to a strategic and growing market where we have been underrepresented. Before this investment, our market share in South America was less than 2%. While the JV is a modest size operation today, it provides a good base for expansion to serve the broader South American market with a low-cost, high-quality product. This should enable us to drive faster-share growth over the long term.
We also remain committed to reinvesting capital back in this business to support customer growth. We have added 3 new french fry lines since 2014. And despite these additions, our current capacity utilization is above our targeted operating rates due to recent demand growth being faster than historical averages. While we are not prepared to announce any capacity expansion projects today, we are aggressively evaluating opportunities to expand production capacity inside and outside North America to support our customers' growth. We look forward to sharing our expansion plans with you soon. In the meantime, we're actively working to stretch existing capacity by debottlenecking lines and driving productivity.
And finally, in addition to reinvesting back into the business, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.23 a share or $0.92 on an annual basis. That puts our dividend payout ratio at about 27% on the latest 12-month basis, which is within our target payout range of 25% to 35%. We will continue to supplement our dividends with share repurchases. In the second quarter, we bought back about $8.5 million of stock, which is largely consistent with our goal to at least offset equity compensation dilution. To do so, we estimate that we need to buy back around $40 million of stock annually.
Now switching to the potato crop. Recent press reports have led to market fears of raw potato and french fry shortages. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will resource the vast majority of our raw potatoes and where we have most of our production facilities is consistent with historical averages in terms of both yield and quality. As a result, we expect to operate our plants there at normal utilization rates.
In Alberta, Canada, where we have 1 plant, crop yields and quality are below average as a result of adverse weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. However, we've been able to secure enough potatoes to operate that plant at normal rates. Nonetheless, overall potato availability in Alberta is limited.
In Minnesota, where we have a single plant through our joint venture, Lamb Weston RDO, crop yields and quality are below average, also due to poor weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. As a result, potato availability in the upper Midwest will also be limited. However, our partner in that plant is the primary supplier of raw potatoes, and they expect to provide adequate supply for the plant to operate as planned.
Also, we understand that the crops and other key growing regions, such as Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, are below average due to adverse weather. This limits the availability of potatoes in North America. It's important to note that we do not currently source raw potatoes from these regions. So let me be clear, given our concentration of processing facilities in the Columbia Basin in Idaho as well as our strong grower relationships in Alberta and the Midwest, and most importantly, our decision to source open potato several months ago, we're confident that we have raw potatoes to deliver our volume growth targets for the remainder of our fiscal year. However, potato supply in North America is tight, and this may pressure our ability to pursue incremental volume growth opportunities both domestically and internationally for this crop year. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve price and mix in each of our business segments.
Now turning to Europe. The potato supply there is also expected to be challenging due to quality and late harvest weather conditions. Compared to last year's historically poor harvest, the potato crops in the Netherlands and Belgium this year are better, but still below average. The crops in Germany, Poland and the U.K. are more challenged. As a result, raw potato prices in Europe remain elevated versus historical averages, but are below prices that we experienced last year. So we expect that Lamb Weston/Meijer's performance will continue to improve compared to last year as cost pressures ease in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the new crop.
With respect to the operating environment, we believe that industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the second quarter, and they will likely remain so for the remainder of our fiscal year subject to raw potato availability. We believe global demand growth for frozen potato products is generally favorable and will remain so through fiscal 2020. Similar to what we saw earlier in the year, U.S. demand in the second quarter continued to be underpinned by positive restaurant traffic trends and quick-service traffic growth was strong, again, led by growth at chicken-based outlets.
Demand in our key international markets as well as in Europe continued to grow in line with recent trends. Together, these factors helped drive our strong volume growth in the quarter, especially in our Global segment. So in summary, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half results. We expect the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable for the balance of the year, underpinned by solid demand growth. We are well positioned with raw potatoes to deliver our volume targets. And finally, our successful execution of our strategy is generating strong cash flows, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to support growth and step up cash return to shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook."
374372246,647798890,1887066,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 03, 2020",2020-01-03,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom.

Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1,019 million, with volume growth and favorable price/mi",1936,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1,019 million, with volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments. Volume increased 10%, led by growth in our Global and Foodservice segments. Our 2 acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals, added about 1.5 points of volume growth. In addition, we had a couple of extra shipping days than we had in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the timing of Thanksgiving. These extra couple of days contribute about another plenty of volume growth. As a result, this will pose a headwind to our Q3 results on a year-over-year basis. Price/mix was up 2% due to pricing actions and favorable mix.
Our strong sales growth drove a $36 million or 14% increase in gross profit. Favorable price/mix, volume growth, along with lower transportation costs drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston.
In addition, the increase in gross profit included a $4 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts. That's compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage increased about 65 basis points to 28%. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was up about 5 points.
While we made a lot of progress improving our planned operating performance from the first quarter, in the second quarter, we continued to incur higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtimes, which affected our production levels. This impacted fixed cost absorption, raised overall maintenance cost and lowered recovery rates. In addition, some of the cost that we realized in the second quarter was a carryover effect as we work through finished goods inventories from the first quarter. Since our plants are now operating at more normal levels, we expect only a modest carryover effect from these manufacturing efficiencies in our fiscal third quarter results.
SG&A expense was $92 million, an increase of about $17 million. About $6 million of this increase was related to higher incentive compensation accruals based primarily on our performance. About $4 million of the change reflects an insurance settlement that we had last year, but this was partially offset by a $2 million reduction in foreign exchange losses. About $7 million of the increase related to investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. Finally, more than $2 million of the increase was related to designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. As we previously discussed, we expect to spend about $10 million to $20 million of one-time costs this year on implementing a new ERP system. To date, we've spent about $4 million, so we expect spending to ramp up in the second half of the year.
Income from operations increased about $20 million, or 11%, to $194 million. This reflected solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe, Lamb Weston RDO in Minnesota and our new joint venture in Argentina were $15 million in the quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $6 million, largely reflecting lower raw potato prices in Europe.
So putting it all together, EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $38 million, or 17%, to $261 million. Operating gains by our base business, along with contributions from the BSW consolidation and the Australian acquisitions, drove about $32 million of EBITDA growth. Our unconsolidated joint ventures added about $6 million.
Moving down the income statement. Interest expense was about $25 million, which is about $1 million below last year. Our effective tax rate was more than 23% or about 2 points higher than last year due to discrete items.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.15, or 19%, to $0.95. Operating gains in our base business and higher equity earnings drove the increase. We also had an approximately $0.04 benefit from the BSW consolidation.
Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based change as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 15%. Volume grew 14%. The increase was driven by higher sales, including increased sales of limited time offerings to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a 3-point benefit from the acquisitions in Australia and a 1-point benefit from the additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving.
Price/mix rose 1%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multiyear contracts. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expense, increased $17 million or 15%. Volume growth, favorable price/mix and lower transportation costs drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and higher depreciation expense associated with the Hermiston line.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 9%. Volume increased 5%, led by growth of distributor private label and Lamb Weston branded products. About half of the volume increase was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Even after adjusting for the Thanksgiving shift, we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth as our direct sales force continued to strengthen customer relationships. Price/mix increased 4%, primarily reflecting pricing actions taken in October. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $14 million or 14%. Favorable price/mix, volume growth and lower transportation costs more than offset higher manufacturing cost and depreciation expense.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 7%, driven by 4 points of volume growth behind the increased sales of branded and private label products. About 2 points of the volume growth was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Price/mix increased 2 -- 3%, excuse me, largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $3 million or 10%. Favorable price/mix and volume growth drove the increase and was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost, depreciation expense and A&P spending.
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.6x. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $345 million of cash from operations in the first half of the year. That's up about 9% versus last year, driven by our earnings growth. We used about $135 million towards acquisitions, including a $17 million initial payment for our half of the new joint venture in Argentina. We also invested nearly $110 million combined in capital expenditures and IT-related projects. In addition, we bought back more than $13 million of stock and paid $59 million in dividends to our shareholders.
Turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. As Tom noted, because of our first -- strong first half performance, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. As a reminder, our targets include the contribution of 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to be prudent when updating our annual outlook.
For the full year, we're now targeting sales to grow at the high end of our original mid- to high single-digit rate range. We continue to expect that sales will be primarily driven by volume, and it will deliver price/mix increases to offset input cost inflation. As you know, we delivered 10% sales growth in the first half, including a 2% higher price/mix and robust 8% volume growth. We expect our volume growth will moderate in the second half for a number of reasons. In our Global segment, volume growth in the first half of the year was faster than we had anticipated due to domestic QSR traffic growth above historical trends and international demand was also above our initial expectations. While we expect global demand will remain generally favorable in the back half of the year, we expect these trends may begin to normalize towards historical growth rates.
Also in our Global segment, in the third quarter, we'll be lapping strong sales of limited time offering products. Also in the third quarter, we realized a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point due to a lower number of shipping days versus the prior year quarter as a result of the timing of Thanksgiving. This will affect each of our core business segments, with the most pronounced impact in our Foodservice segment.
Finally, in our Retail segment, we'll realize the effect of losing some low-margin contracts in our private label retail business.
In short, we expect to drive solid sales growth in the second half, led primarily by volume growth with modestly higher price/mix. For earnings, we've increased our full year target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, to a range of $965 million to $985 million. That's up from a range of $950 million to $970 million.
For the second half, we expect that gross profit will rise largely in line with sales growth, with volume growth and favorable price/mix offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. As a result, we expect that gross margin percentage will be essentially flat in the second half. However, gross margin in the third quarter may be pressured as a result of difficult prior year comparison. Gross margin in the third quarter fiscal 2019 included a $4 million benefit from unrealized gains on hedging contracts, a mix benefit due to strong sales of higher-margin limited time offering products in our Global segment and cost benefit from supply chain efficiencies, especially around edible oils and transportation.
Regarding SG&A. For the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising and promotional expenses as well as onetime ERP investments will be within our target range of 8% to 8.5% of sales. A&P expense in the second half should be a bit above the $11 million we've spent so far. As I previously noted, we anticipate total ERP system implementation spending to ramp up versus the $4 million of onetime expense that we incurred in the first half. We continue to target total onetime expenses related to the project between $10 million and $20 million for the full year.
With respect to equity earnings, we continue to expect that it will continue to gradually improve in the second half despite the potato crop in Europe, again, being somewhat challenged.
To summarize, in the second half of the year, we'll deliver solid growth in EBITDA, including joint ventures, driven by sales and gross profit growth as well as improved equity earnings. This growth will be tempered by higher SG&A expense as we step up spending behind our ERP implementation. In addition, it's important to note that we had an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2019 -- 2020, excuse me. Since we completed that transaction around mid-fiscal 2019, we'll no longer have that benefit in the back half of this fiscal year.
Finally, most of our other financial targets remain the same. We continue to target total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million and total capital expenditures, which includes some CapEx for our new ERP system of around $300 million. We've updated our effective tax rate target to be about 24%. That's on the high end of our previous estimate of 23% to 24%.
Now back to Tom for some closing comments."

We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute well. Specifically, sales increased 12% behind strong volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments.
EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 17%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%. And in the first half of the year, we generated $345 million of cash flow from operations. Because of our strong year-to-date results and good operating momentum, we've raised our fiscal 2020 outlook for both sales and EBITDA. As Dexter mentioned, I'd like to update you on some capital allocation actions we've recently taken as well as our thoughts on the potato crop in the current operating environment.
On capital allocation. In October, we acquired a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture in Argentina. This JV will provide us better access to a strategic and growing market where we have been underrepresented. Before this investment, our market share in South America was less than 2%. While the JV is a modest size operation today, it provides a good base for expansion to serve the broader South American market with a low-cost, high-quality product. This should enable us to drive faster-share growth over the long term.
We also remain committed to reinvesting capital back in this business to support customer growth. We have added 3 new french fry lines since 2014. And despite these additions, our current capacity utilization is above our targeted operating rates due to recent demand growth being faster than historical averages. While we are not prepared to announce any capacity expansion projects today, we are aggressively evaluating opportunities to expand production capacity inside and outside North America to support our customers' growth. We look forward to sharing our expansion plans with you soon. In the meantime, we're actively working to stretch existing capacity by debottlenecking lines and driving productivity.
And finally, in addition to reinvesting back into the business, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.23 a share or $0.92 on an annual basis. That puts our dividend payout ratio at about 27% on the latest 12-month basis, which is within our target payout range of 25% to 35%. We will continue to supplement our dividends with share repurchases. In the second quarter, we bought back about $8.5 million of stock, which is largely consistent with our goal to at least offset equity compensation dilution. To do so, we estimate that we need to buy back around $40 million of stock annually.
Now switching to the potato crop. Recent press reports have led to market fears of raw potato and french fry shortages. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will resource the vast majority of our raw potatoes and where we have most of our production facilities is consistent with historical averages in terms of both yield and quality. As a result, we expect to operate our plants there at normal utilization rates.
In Alberta, Canada, where we have 1 plant, crop yields and quality are below average as a result of adverse weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. However, we've been able to secure enough potatoes to operate that plant at normal rates. Nonetheless, overall potato availability in Alberta is limited.
In Minnesota, where we have a single plant through our joint venture, Lamb Weston RDO, crop yields and quality are below average, also due to poor weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. As a result, potato availability in the upper Midwest will also be limited. However, our partner in that plant is the primary supplier of raw potatoes, and they expect to provide adequate supply for the plant to operate as planned.
Also, we understand that the crops and other key growing regions, such as Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, are below average due to adverse weather. This limits the availability of potatoes in North America. It's important to note that we do not currently source raw potatoes from these regions. So let me be clear, given our concentration of processing facilities in the Columbia Basin in Idaho as well as our strong grower relationships in Alberta and the Midwest, and most importantly, our decision to source open potato several months ago, we're confident that we have raw potatoes to deliver our volume growth targets for the remainder of our fiscal year. However, potato supply in North America is tight, and this may pressure our ability to pursue incremental volume growth opportunities both domestically and internationally for this crop year. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve price and mix in each of our business segments.
Now turning to Europe. The potato supply there is also expected to be challenging due to quality and late harvest weather conditions. Compared to last year's historically poor harvest, the potato crops in the Netherlands and Belgium this year are better, but still below average. The crops in Germany, Poland and the U.K. are more challenged. As a result, raw potato prices in Europe remain elevated versus historical averages, but are below prices that we experienced last year. So we expect that Lamb Weston/Meijer's performance will continue to improve compared to last year as cost pressures ease in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the new crop.
With respect to the operating environment, we believe that industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the second quarter, and they will likely remain so for the remainder of our fiscal year subject to raw potato availability. We believe global demand growth for frozen potato products is generally favorable and will remain so through fiscal 2020. Similar to what we saw earlier in the year, U.S. demand in the second quarter continued to be underpinned by positive restaurant traffic trends and quick-service traffic growth was strong, again, led by growth at chicken-based outlets.
Demand in our key international markets as well as in Europe continued to grow in line with recent trends. Together, these factors helped drive our strong volume growth in the quarter, especially in our Global segment. So in summary, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half results. We expect the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable for the balance of the year, underpinned by solid demand growth. We are well positioned with raw potatoes to deliver our volume targets. And finally, our successful execution of our strategy is generating strong cash flows, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to support growth and step up cash return to shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook."

As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1,019 million, with volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments. Volume increased 10%, led by growth in our Global and Foodservice segments. Our 2 acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals, added about 1.5 points of volume growth. In addition, we had a couple of extra shipping days than we had in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the timing of Thanksgiving. These extra couple of days contribute about another plenty of volume growth. As a result, this will pose a headwind to our Q3 results on a year-over-year basis. Price/mix was up 2% due to pricing actions and favorable mix.
Our strong sales growth drove a $36 million or 14% increase in gross profit. Favorable price/mix, volume growth, along with lower transportation costs drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston.
In addition, the increase in gross profit included a $4 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts. That's compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage increased about 65 basis points to 28%. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was up about 5 points.
While we made a lot of progress improving our planned operating performance from the first quarter, in the second quarter, we continued to incur higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtimes, which affected our production levels. This impacted fixed cost absorption, raised overall maintenance cost and lowered recovery rates. In addition, some of the cost that we realized in the second quarter was a carryover effect as we work through finished goods inventories from the first quarter. Since our plants are now operating at more normal levels, we expect only a modest carryover effect from these manufacturing efficiencies in our fiscal third quarter results.
SG&A expense was $92 million, an increase of about $17 million. About $6 million of this increase was related to higher incentive compensation accruals based primarily on our performance. About $4 million of the change reflects an insurance settlement that we had last year, but this was partially offset by a $2 million reduction in foreign exchange losses. About $7 million of the increase related to investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. Finally, more than $2 million of the increase was related to designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. As we previously discussed, we expect to spend about $10 million to $20 million of onetime costs this year on implementing a new ERP system. To date, we've spent about $4 million, so we expect spending to ramp up in the second half of the year.
Income from operations increased about $20 million, or 11%, to $194 million. This reflected solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe, Lamb Weston RDO in Minnesota and our new joint venture in Argentina were $15 million in the quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $6 million, largely reflecting lower raw potato prices in Europe.
So putting it all together, EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $38 million, or 17%, to $261 million. Operating gains by our base business, along with contributions from the BSW consolidation and the Australian acquisitions, drove about $32 million of EBITDA growth. Our unconsolidated joint ventures added about $6 million.
Moving down the income statement. Interest expense was about $25 million, which is about $1 million below last year. Our effective tax rate was more than 23% or about 2 points higher than last year due to discrete items.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.15, or 19%, to $0.95. Operating gains in our base business and higher equity earnings drove the increase. We also had an approximately $0.04 benefit from the BSW consolidation.
Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based change as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 15%. Volume grew 14%. The increase was driven by higher sales, including increased sales of limited time offerings to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a 3-point benefit from the acquisitions in Australia and a 1-point benefit from the additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving.
Price/mix rose 1%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multiyear contracts. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expense, increased $17 million or 15%. Volume growth, favorable price/mix and lower transportation costs drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and higher depreciation expense associated with the Hermiston line.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 9%. Volume increased 5%, led by growth of distributor private label and Lamb Weston branded products. About half of the volume increase was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Even after adjusting for the Thanksgiving shift, we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth as our direct sales force continued to strengthen customer relationships. Price/mix increased 4%, primarily reflecting pricing actions taken in October. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $14 million or 14%. Favorable price/mix, volume growth and lower transportation costs more than offset higher manufacturing cost and depreciation expense.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 7%, driven by 4 points of volume growth behind the increased sales of branded and private label products. About 2 points of the volume growth was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Price/mix increased 2 -- 3%, excuse me, largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $3 million or 10%. Favorable price/mix and volume growth drove the increase and was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost, depreciation expense and A&P spending.
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.6x. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $345 million of cash from operations in the first half of the year. That's up about 9% versus last year, driven by our earnings growth. We used about $135 million towards acquisitions, including a $17 million initial payment for our half of the new joint venture in Argentina. We also invested nearly $110 million combined in capital expenditures and IT-related projects. In addition, we bought back more than $13 million of stock and paid $59 million in dividends to our shareholders.
Turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. As Tom noted, because of our first -- strong first half performance, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. As a reminder, our targets include the contribution of 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to be prudent when updating our annual outlook.
For the full year, we're now targeting sales to grow at the high end of our original mid- to high single-digit rate range. We continue to expect that sales will be primarily driven by volume, and it will deliver price/mix increases to offset input cost inflation. As you know, we delivered 10% sales growth in the first half, including a 2% higher price/mix and robust 8% volume growth. We expect our volume growth will moderate in the second half for a number of reasons. In our Global segment, volume growth in the first half of the year was faster than we had anticipated due to domestic QSR traffic growth above historical trends and international demand was also above our initial expectations. While we expect global demand will remain generally favorable in the back half of the year, we expect these trends may begin to normalize towards historical growth rates.
Also in our Global segment, in the third quarter, we'll be lapping strong sales of limited time offering products. Also in the third quarter, we realized a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point due to a lower number of shipping days versus the prior year quarter as a result of the timing of Thanksgiving. This will affect each of our core business segments, with the most pronounced impact in our Foodservice segment.
Finally, in our Retail segment, we'll realize the effect of losing some low-margin contracts in our private label retail business.
In short, we expect to drive solid sales growth in the second half, led primarily by volume growth with modestly higher price/mix. For earnings, we've increased our full year target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, to a range of $965 million to $985 million. That's up from a range of $950 million to $970 million.
For the second half, we expect that gross profit will rise largely in line with sales growth, with volume growth and favorable price/mix offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. As a result, we expect that gross margin percentage will be essentially flat in the second half. However, gross margin in the third quarter may be pressured as a result of difficult prior year comparison. Gross margin in the third quarter fiscal 2019 included a $4 million benefit from unrealized gains on hedging contracts, a mix benefit due to strong sales of higher-margin limited time offering products in our Global segment and cost benefit from supply chain efficiencies, especially around edible oils and transportation.
Regarding SG&A. For the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising and promotional expenses as well as onetime ERP investments will be within our target range of 8% to 8.5% of sales. A&P expense in the second half should be a bit above the $11 million we've spent so far. As I previously noted, we anticipate total ERP system implementation spending to ramp up versus the $4 million of onetime expense that we incurred in the first half. We continue to target total onetime expenses related to the project between $10 million and $20 million for the full year.
With respect to equity earnings, we continue to expect that it will continue to gradually improve in the second half despite the potato crop in Europe, again, being somewhat challenged.
To summarize, in the second half of the year, we'll deliver solid growth in EBITDA, including joint ventures, driven by sales and gross profit growth as well as improved equity earnings. This growth will be tempered by higher SG&A expense as we step up spending behind our ERP implementation. In addition, it's important to note that we had an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2019 -- 2020, excuse me. Since we completed that transaction around mid-fiscal 2019, we'll no longer have that benefit in the back half of this fiscal year.
Finally, most of our other financial targets remain the same. We continue to target total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million and total capital expenditures, which includes some CapEx for our new ERP system of around $300 million. We've updated our effective tax rate target to be about 24%. That's on the high end of our previous estimate of 23% to 24%.
Now back to Tom for some closing comments."

And could we see more capacity or the need for more capacity coming more quickly?"

We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute well. Specifically, sales increased 12% behind strong volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments.
EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 17%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%. And in the first half of the year, we generated $345 million of cash flow from operations. Because of our strong year-to-date results and good operating momentum, we've raised our fiscal 2020 outlook for both sales and EBITDA. As Dexter mentioned, I'd like to update you on some capital allocation actions we've recently taken as well as our thoughts on the potato crop in the current operating environment.
On capital allocation. In October, we acquired a 50% ownership interest in a new joint venture in Argentina. This JV will provide us better access to a strategic and growing market where we have been underrepresented. Before this investment, our market share in South America was less than 2%. While the JV is a modest size operation today, it provides a good base for expansion to serve the broader South American market with a low-cost, high-quality product. This should enable us to drive faster-share growth over the long term.
We also remain committed to reinvesting capital back in this business to support customer growth. We have added 3 new French fry lines since 2014. And despite these additions, our current capacity utilization is above our targeted operating rates due to recent demand growth being faster than historical averages. While we are not prepared to announce any capacity expansion projects today, we are aggressively evaluating opportunities to expand production capacity inside and outside North America to support our customers' growth. We look forward to sharing our expansion plans with you soon. In the meantime, we're actively working to stretch existing capacity by debottlenecking lines and driving productivity.
And finally, in addition to reinvesting back into the business, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Last month, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.23 a share or $0.92 on an annual basis. That puts our dividend payout ratio at about 27% on the latest 12-month basis, which is within our target payout range of 25% to 35%. We will continue to supplement our dividends with share repurchases. In the second quarter, we bought back about $8.5 million of stock, which is largely consistent with our goal to at least offset equity compensation dilution. To do so, we estimate that we need to buy back around $40 million of stock annually.
Now switching to the potato crop. Recent press reports have led to market fears of raw potato and French fry shortages. As we discussed on our last earnings call, the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will resource the vast majority of our raw potatoes and where we have most of our production facilities is consistent with historical averages in terms of both yield and quality. As a result, we expect to operate our plants there at normal utilization rates.
In Alberta, Canada, where we have 1 plant, crop yields and quality are below average as a result of adverse weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. However, we've been able to secure enough potatoes to operate that plant at normal rates. Nonetheless, overall potato availability in Alberta is limited.
In Minnesota, where we have a single plant through our joint venture, Lamb Weston RDO, crop yields and quality are below average, also due to poor weather conditions during the growing season and harvest periods. As a result, potato availability in the upper Midwest will also be limited. However, our partner in that plant is the primary supplier of raw potatoes, and they expect to provide adequate supply for the plant to operate as planned.
Also, we understand that the crops and other key growing regions, such as Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, are below average due to adverse weather. This limits the availability of potatoes in North America. It's important to note that we do not currently source raw potatoes from these regions. So let me be clear, given our concentration of processing facilities in the Columbia Basin in Idaho as well as our strong grower relationships in Alberta and the Midwest, and most importantly, our decision to source open potato several months ago, we're confident that we have raw potatoes to deliver our volume growth targets for the remainder of our fiscal year. However, potato supply in North America is tight, and this may pressure our ability to pursue incremental volume growth opportunities both domestically and internationally for this crop year. Accordingly, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to improve price and mix in each of our business segments.
Now turning to Europe. The potato supply there is also expected to be challenging due to quality and late harvest weather conditions. Compared to last year's historically poor harvest, the potato crops in the Netherlands and Belgium this year are better, but still below average. The crops in Germany, Poland and the U.K. are more challenged. As a result, raw potato prices in Europe remain elevated versus historical averages, but are below prices that we experienced last year. So we expect that Lamb Weston/Meijer's performance will continue to improve compared to last year as cost pressures ease in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the new crop.
With respect to the operating environment, we believe that industry capacity utilization rates in North America remain elevated during the second quarter, and they will likely remain so for the remainder of our fiscal year subject to raw potato availability. We believe global demand growth for frozen potato products is generally favorable and will remain so through fiscal 2020. Similar to what we saw earlier in the year, U.S. demand in the second quarter continued to be underpinned by positive restaurant traffic trends and quick-service traffic growth was strong, again, led by growth at chicken-based outlets.
Demand in our key international markets as well as in Europe continued to grow in line with recent trends. Together, these factors helped drive our strong volume growth in the quarter, especially in our Global segment. So in summary, we delivered a strong second quarter and first half results. We expect the overall operating environment to remain generally favorable for the balance of the year, underpinned by solid demand growth. We are well positioned with raw potatoes to deliver our volume targets. And finally, our successful execution of our strategy is generating strong cash flows, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to support growth and step up cash return to shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Rob to provide the details on our second quarter results and our updated outlook."

As Tom noted, we delivered another strong performance in the quarter and for the first half of the year. Specifically in the quarter, net sales increased 12% to $1,019 million, with volume growth and favorable price/mix in each of our core business segments. Volume increased 10%, led by growth in our Global and Foodservice segments. Our 2 acquisitions in Australia, Marvel Packers and Ready Meals, added about 1.5 points of volume growth. In addition, we had a couple of extra shipping days than we had in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 due to the timing of Thanksgiving. These extra couple of days contribute about another plenty of volume growth. As a result, this will pose a headwind to our Q3 results on a year-over-year basis. Price/mix was up 2% due to pricing actions and favorable mix.
Our strong sales growth drove a $36 million or 14% increase in gross profit. Favorable price/mix, volume growth, along with lower transportation costs drove the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies and higher depreciation expense associated with our new production line in Hermiston.
In addition, the increase in gross profit included a $4 million benefit from unrealized mark-to-market adjustments related to commodity hedging contracts. That's compared to a $2 million loss in the prior year period. Our gross margin percentage increased about 65 basis points to 28%. Excluding the mark-to-market adjustments, it was up about 5 points.
While we made a lot of progress improving our planned operating performance from the first quarter, in the second quarter, we continued to incur higher than normal periods of unscheduled operating downtimes, which affected our production levels. This impacted fixed cost absorption, raised overall maintenance cost and lowered recovery rates. In addition, some of the cost that we realized in the second quarter was a carryover effect as we work through finished goods inventories from the first quarter. Since our plants are now operating at more normal levels, we expect only a modest carryover effect from these manufacturing efficiencies in our fiscal third quarter results.
SG&A expense was $92 million, an increase of about $17 million. About $6 million of this increase was related to higher incentive compensation accruals based primarily on our performance. About $4 million of the change reflects an insurance settlement that we had last year, but this was partially offset by a $2 million reduction in foreign exchange losses. About $7 million of the increase related to investments in our sales, marketing and operating capabilities. Finally, more than $2 million of the increase was related to designing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. As we previously discussed, we expect to spend about $10 million to $20 million of onetime costs this year on implementing a new ERP system. To date, we've spent about $4 million, so we expect spending to ramp up in the second half of the year.
Income from operations increased about $20 million, or 11%, to $194 million. This reflected solid sales and gross profit growth. Equity method investment earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures, which include Lamb Weston/Meijer in Europe, Lamb Weston RDO in Minnesota and our new joint venture in Argentina were $15 million in the quarter. Excluding mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $6 million, largely reflecting lower raw potato prices in Europe.
So putting it all together, EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $38 million, or 17%, to $261 million. Operating gains by our base business, along with contributions from the BSW consolidation and the Australian acquisitions, drove about $32 million of EBITDA growth. Our unconsolidated joint ventures added about $6 million.
Moving down the income statement. Interest expense was about $25 million, which is about $1 million below last year. Our effective tax rate was more than 23% or about 2 points higher than last year due to discrete items.
Turning to earnings per share. Adjusted diluted EPS was up $0.15, or 19%, to $0.95. Operating gains in our base business and higher equity earnings drove the increase. We also had an approximately $0.04 benefit from the BSW consolidation.
Now let's review the results for each of our business segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based change as well as all sales outside of North America, were up 15%. Volume grew 14%. The increase was driven by higher sales, including increased sales of limited time offerings to strategic customers in the U.S. and key international markets. It also includes a 3-point benefit from the acquisitions in Australia and a 1-point benefit from the additional shipping days related to the timing of Thanksgiving.
Price/mix rose 1%, primarily reflecting pricing adjustments associated with multiyear contracts. Global product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expense, increased $17 million or 15%. Volume growth, favorable price/mix and lower transportation costs drove the increase, which was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost and higher depreciation expense associated with the Hermiston line.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, increased 9%. Volume increased 5%, led by growth of distributor private label and Lamb Weston branded products. About half of the volume increase was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Even after adjusting for the Thanksgiving shift, we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of volume growth as our direct sales force continued to strengthen customer relationships. Price/mix increased 4%, primarily reflecting pricing actions taken in October. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased $14 million or 14%. Favorable price/mix, volume growth and lower transportation costs more than offset higher manufacturing cost and depreciation expense.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 7%, driven by 4 points of volume growth behind the increased sales of branded and private label products. About 2 points of the volume growth was due to the additional shipping days in the quarter. Price/mix increased 2 -- 3%, excuse me, largely due to favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $3 million or 10%. Favorable price/mix and volume growth drove the increase and was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost, depreciation expense and A&P spending.
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was about $2.2 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.6x. With respect to cash flow, we generated nearly $345 million of cash from operations in the first half of the year. That's up about 9% versus last year, driven by our earnings growth. We used about $135 million towards acquisitions, including a $17 million initial payment for our half of the new joint venture in Argentina. We also invested nearly $110 million combined in capital expenditures and IT-related projects. In addition, we bought back more than $13 million of stock and paid $59 million in dividends to our shareholders.
Turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. As Tom noted, because of our first -- strong first half performance, we've raised our sales and earnings outlook for the full year. As a reminder, our targets include the contribution of 53rd week that will benefit the fourth quarter. Overall, we continue to be prudent when updating our annual outlook.
For the full year, we're now targeting sales to grow at the high end of our original mid- to high single-digit rate range. We continue to expect that sales will be primarily driven by volume, and it will deliver price/mix increases to offset input cost inflation. As you know, we delivered 10% sales growth in the first half, including a 2% higher price/mix and robust 8% volume growth. We expect our volume growth will moderate in the second half for a number of reasons. In our Global segment, volume growth in the first half of the year was faster than we had anticipated due to domestic QSR traffic growth above historical trends and international demand was also above our initial expectations. While we expect global demand will remain generally favorable in the back half of the year, we expect these trends may begin to normalize towards historical growth rates.
Also in our Global segment, in the third quarter, we'll be lapping strong sales of limited time offering products. Also in the third quarter, we realized a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point due to a lower number of shipping days versus the prior year quarter as a result of the timing of Thanksgiving. This will affect each of our core business segments, with the most pronounced impact in our Foodservice segment.
Finally, in our Retail segment, we'll realize the effect of losing some low-margin contracts in our private label retail business.
In short, we expect to drive solid sales growth in the second half, led primarily by volume growth with modestly higher price/mix. For earnings, we've increased our full year target for adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, to a range of $965 million to $985 million. That's up from a range of $950 million to $970 million.
For the second half, we expect that gross profit will rise largely in line with sales growth, with volume growth and favorable price/mix offsetting input cost inflation and higher depreciation expense. As a result, we expect that gross margin percentage will be essentially flat in the second half. However, gross margin in the third quarter may be pressured as a result of difficult prior year comparison. Gross margin in the third quarter fiscal 2019 included a $4 million benefit from unrealized gains on hedging contracts, a mix benefit due to strong sales of higher-margin limited time offering products in our Global segment and cost benefit from supply chain efficiencies, especially around edible oils and transportation.
Regarding SG&A. For the year, we continue to expect our base SG&A, which excludes advertising and promotional expenses as well as onetime ERP investments will be within our target range of 8% to 8.5% of sales. A&P expense in the second half should be a bit above the $11 million we've spent so far. As I previously noted, we anticipate total ERP system implementation spending to ramp up versus the $4 million of onetime expense that we incurred in the first half. We continue to target total onetime expenses related to the project between $10 million and $20 million for the full year.
With respect to equity earnings, we continue to expect that it will continue to gradually improve in the second half despite the potato crop in Europe, again, being somewhat challenged.
To summarize, in the second half of the year, we'll deliver solid growth in EBITDA, including joint ventures, driven by sales and gross profit growth as well as improved equity earnings. This growth will be tempered by higher SG&A expense as we step up spending behind our ERP implementation. In addition, it's important to note that we had an approximately $10 million year-over-year earnings benefit from the BSW consolidation in the first half of fiscal 2019 -- 2020, excuse me. Since we completed that transaction around mid-fiscal 2019, we'll no longer have that benefit in the back half of this fiscal year.
Finally, most of our other financial targets remain the same. We continue to target total interest expense of around $110 million, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $175 million and total capital expenditures, which includes some CapEx for our new ERP system of around $300 million. We've updated our effective tax rate target to be about 24%. That's on the high end of our previous estimate of 23% to 24%.
Now back to Tom for some closing comments."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're clearly in a time of considerable uncertainty as it relates to the scope and speed of the COVID pandemic, and the impact on the global economy, our industry and each of our lives. We'll do our best to answer your questions relating to consumer demand and our response to the crisis, but please recognize that much is still unknown. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we've withdrawn our financial outlook despite only 2 months remaining in our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, it's extremely difficult to reasonably forecast customer and consumer demand in North America in our key international markets. In a few minutes, Rob will provide details on our performance for the third quarter, but let me start by sharing with you our priorities as it relates to our Lamb Weston team, our operations and our customers. 
First, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team. I'm proud of how we're managing through this adversity, including all the efforts to protect and support our employees, families, neighbors and local communities, meeting our obligation to continue to provide food to help feed people all over the globe, working with our customers and continuing to support our business. We're rallying together to care for one another. It's that spirit of teamwork as well as our service-oriented culture that serves as a cornerstone for making Lamb Weston so great. 
It's paramount to ensure the health safety and emotional well-being of our Lamb Weston team. People must feel safe and comfortable where they work. Since the potential severity of this outbreak became apparent, my management team and I have led a cross-functional task force to ensure that we make decisions using the most up-to-date information from the CDC and other authorities. We're leveraging our experience in China, where, except for a government-mandated 10-day extension of the Chinese New Year, we operated through the worst of the outbreak. We've taken steps to enhance sanitation protocols in our production facilities and offices, promote social distancing by having employees work at home when possible, and canceling almost all travel. 
Second, as a leader in our category, and as I mentioned earlier, we have the obligation to continue to make food and do our part to feed people across the country and around the world. And we take this responsibility seriously. We're confident in our ability to continue to safely produce fries and other frozen potato products. As you can imagine, the demand situation remains fluid, so there will undoubtedly be an effect on our operations and supply chain, we're watching consumer and customer demand and have begun to adapt our production schedules to react accordingly. As appropriate, we'll take further actions to align our manufacturing operations, including temporarily reducing production. 
Third, we and our joint venture partners are committed to remaining a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they all manage through supply chain and inventory concerns. Several large QSR chain customers have already indicated to us that fries are a priority item. We and our customers will not likely be able to forecast consumer demand trends given the breadth of the pandemic and the pace under which it continues to unfold. However, while a good data on the pandemic effect on the restaurant traffic, consumer buying patterns and french fry demand is limited, we can provide some insight into what we've seen so far in some of our markets in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. 
In China, after the government played severe social and movement restrictions that significantly reduced restaurant traffic, french fries demand declined about 50% for about a month. As restrictions have relaxed, we've seen volume climb back to about 70% of pre-crisis demand today. Our team there has responded well and continues to manage through the impact of the virus. We're adopting lessons learned from them to our operations around the world. In other key markets in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, we've seen only a modest impact on French fry demand. While our sales in these markets mirror these trends, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation for additional evidence of consumer reaction and fry demand. In the U.S., it's still too early to determine how the impact on demand will play out. Normally, about 65% of all fries are purchased at a quick-serve restaurant, with another 20% purchased at a full serve restaurant. The remaining 15% is purchased at retail. Our sales breakdown is broadly consistent with that split, our Global segment, which accounts for about 52% of our total sales, primarily serves large QSR chain customers in the U.S. and internationally, largely including Asia, Australia and Mexico. Our Foodservice segment, which is about 30% of sales, primarily sells to a range of foodservice operations. We estimate that close to 80% of the segment sales are to full-service restaurants and outlets, such as workplace cafeterias, hotels, hospitals and schools, with more than 20% to smaller QSRs. Our Retail segment historically accounts for about 13% of our sales. Of the fries purchase at a QSR, normally about 2/3 have been purchased via drive-through carryout or delivery, with the remaining 1/3 consumed on premises. Prior to the adoption of more severe social and movement restrictions, we saw little change in orders and shipments to QSRs as increases in drive-through traffic as well as higher delivery orders cushioned much of the decline in on-premise dining. However, with the adoption of more severe restrictions across more states were seeing orders beginning to slow. If the China experience provides an appropriate guide, then we would expect QSR volumes to begin to recover at a faster rate than for full-service restaurants after the more severe restrictions are relaxed. Traffic at full-service restaurants and operations in the U.S. is expected to be down much more sharply than the QSRs. While many of these operators are taking steps to boost takeout and delivery sales, we expect this will make up only a fraction of lost business. So our sales to these types of customers are more at risk. In contrast, retail demand for frozen fries has significantly increased as food and home consumption rises with the adoption of social distancing policies and family stocking their freezers. We've taken steps to boost production of our retail products in order to meet the increased demand. So the bottom line is that, in the U.S., QSRs that have established drive through take out and delivery capabilities, are in a much better position in the current environment than full-service restaurants and other outlets that largely cater to dine-in traffic. Retail will likely benefit in the near-term with more meals prepared at home and pantry loading. 
In Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, fry purchasing patterns are much different than in the U.S. Most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway via walk in traffic, since drive-through options are much more limited. The impact of the virus on demand so far has been most pronounced in Italy after it adopted severe social movement restrictions. Other European nations have since adopted similar restrictions, so we expect the decline in demand to accelerate in those countries as well, which will further negatively impact Lamb Weston/Meijer's results. 
Before turning the call over to Rob, I will first talk about our financial liquidity and capital allocation. We have a strong balance sheet and have sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis, even if it results in a prolonged downturn in demand. Last week, in an abundance of caution, we fully drew down our existing $500 million revolver in order to provide additional financial flexibility in light of the market uncertainty. As you have seen a couple of weeks ago, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we temporarily suspended our modest share repurchase program. Finally, we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure, working capital and capital expenditures. This means deferring capital when possible, including postponing all noncritical projects. 
Let me close by saying that these are extraordinary times, nothing about confronting this pandemic will be easy. But Lamb Weston is well positioned in terms of our business mix, operating flexibility, cost structure and liquidity position to weather the storm. Our entire team is committed to stepping up and doing our part to keep feeding people, support our communities and be a valued, stable business partner for our customers. We're taking the necessary actions in our operations to navigate through this crisis by working in close partnership with customers and suppliers across the globe. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the impact of the pandemic raised across the glob",987,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the impact of the pandemic raised across the globe, we were on track to deliver the financial targets that we outlined on January 3, 2020. We provided a more detailed description of our third quarter results in our earnings release and in the 10-Q, which we'll file later today. 
Here are some brief highlights. Net sales increased 1% due to a 1% increase in price/mix. Volume was flat, as growth in Foodservice segment was partially offset by a decline in our Global segment's reported volume. While volume growth of non-customized or limited time offering products in our Global segment was strong, it was more than offset by timing of sales of customized and higher margin limited time offering products as well as the initial effects of the pandemic on restaurant traffic in China. In addition, acquisitions contributed more than 1 point of volume growth, but this was largely offset by a 1 point decline due to fewer shipping days in the quarter related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Gross profit declined $23 million or 8%, primarily due to input and fixed cost inflation. Edible oils drove most of the input cost inflation, while higher insurance rates and medical expenses drove most of the increase in fixed costs. In addition, unrealized gains on commodity hedging contracts was a $4 million headwind, largely as a result of a $4 million gain that we realized in the prior year quarter. SG&A expense increased about $8 million, and included $2 million of nonrecurring consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. Through the first 9 months, we realized about $6 million in onetime ERP-related costs, and expect to spend around $10 million for the year. Regarding our ERP project, we're slowing it down a bit to manage both costs and risk in light of the challenging operating environment at hand. 
Equity method earnings, excluding comparability items, declined about $2 million. But this was due to a negative $6 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased about $4.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $26 million or 10% to $228 million. Lower sales and gross profit in our base business, which again largely reflected the timing of sales in our Global segment and cost inflation, as well as higher SG&A, drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.18 or 19% to $0.77 due largely to lower sales and operating profits as well as lower equity method earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Our Foodservice and Retail businesses reported in line with our expectations, and you can find the details in our earnings release and 10-Q. But let me touch quickly on our Global segment, given the headline performance this quarter. Global's reported sales were down 2%, including a 1% decline in both volume and price/mix. Volume was down primarily because we lapped a very strong growth of customized and limited time product offering products in the prior year quarter. This created about a 7 percentage point volume headwind. The coronavirus-related impact on restaurant traffic in China, while the timing of Thanksgiving, was another 1 point. Increase in shipments of non limited time offering products [Audio Gap] after taking into account the from acquisitions, Global's volume in the third quarter was largely in line with the growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. Global's price mix declined 1%, as pricing actions were more than offset by unfavorable mix. This was due to lower amount of customized and limited time offering products sold versus the strong sales of these kinds of products in the prior year quarter as well as higher proportion of sales to international customers. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, decreased $20 million or 15%. The factors driving the decline in the segment's profitability, primarily lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, are consistent with what drove our total company's growth profit. 
Moving to our cash flow, liquidity position and balance sheet. We generated about $435 million of cash from operations year-to-date. That's down about 2% versus last year due to increased working capital requirements to support our growth. We've also invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures and IT-related projects year-to-date. For fiscal 2020, we've reduced our CapEx target by $100 million to $200 million as we seek near-term opportunities to preserve liquidity. Through the first 9 months, we bought back about $23 million of stock and paid $88 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Tom mentioned, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the current operating environment, even if there's a prolonged decline in demand. This includes having more than $500 million of cash on hand after drawing down our revolver last week. We have a strong balance sheet with about $2.2 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter. Our maturity profile is also attractive. We have an approximately $280 million balance on a term loan facility that matures in November of 2021, and an approximately $290 million balance on another facility that matures in June 2024. The mandatory annual amortization on these 2 loans is about $30 million combined. In addition, we have 2 $833 million high-yield notes that mature in 2024 and 2026, respectively. 
We're also in good shape with respect to our financial covenants. Our first covenant is to maintain debt-to-EBITDA, including joint ventures, leverage ratio, of less than 4.5x. At the end of the third quarter, we were at 2.4x. Our second covenant is in EBITDA, including joint ventures to interest expense ratio of at least 2.75x. At the end of the quarter, we were at nearly 9x. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

But just as you think about this generally and thinking forward, with industry capacity having come online this year, and obviously, that wasn't proved to not really be an issue given how strong demand was.

One is LTOs, which there's always some level of volatility depending on what customers want to promote and how to promote it. The other is these customized products. And so for a number of our large chain customers in particular, which report in the Global business unit, they're very customized products for those customers. And the way -- and we started reporting under the new revenue recognition standard in first quarter 2019. And under that standard, we recognize the revenue for those customized products when we manufacture it and have a purchase order in hand from those customers as opposed to, traditionally, the way I learned it 30 years ago of when the product ships and title changes. And so there's some volatility in when we receive purchase orders on those things. And so we have some large customers. And if we don't have timely receipt of purchase order, we don't recognize that revenue. And so that's what happened between Global, if you look at Q2 to Q3. Q2 wasn't really as good in underlying shipments as what it reflected or was reported, and Q3 wasn't as bad in underlying shipments. And so I think -- so I won't take that revenue recognition piece out of that. In terms of LTOs, interestingly, some of our customers in China are really looking at LTOs and trying to determine when is the right time to launch those to get customer traffic back? And so think about LTOs as a customer traffic incentive, and that's how they use it. And so that's what we're gearing up for now. So I don't think there's anything that would say that customers are or aren't going to use LTOs in the future. In fact, I think if anything, I think they're going to be used, as we indicated in China, to leverage people back into the stores."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. 
We're clearly in a time of considerable uncertainty as it relates to the scope and speed of the COVID pandemic and the impact on the global economy, our industry and each of our lives. We'll do our best to answer your questions relating to consumer demand and our response to the crisis, but please recognize that much is still unknown. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we've withdrawn our financial outlook despite only 2 months remaining in our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, it's extremely difficult to reasonably forecast customer and consumer demand in North America in our key international markets. 
In a few minutes, Rob will provide details on our performance for the third quarter, but let me start by sharing with you our priorities as it relates to our Lamb Weston team, our operations and our customers. 
First, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team. I'm proud of how we're managing through this adversity, including all the efforts to protect and support our employees, families, neighbors and local communities; meeting our obligation to continue to provide food to help feed people all over the globe; working with our customers; and continuing to support our business. We're rallying together to care for one another. It's that spirit of teamwork as well as our service-oriented culture that serves as a cornerstone for making Lamb Weston so great. 
It's paramount to ensure the health, safety and emotional well-being of our Lamb Weston team. People must feel safe and comfortable where they work. Since the potential severity of this outbreak became apparent, my management team and I have led a cross-functional task force to ensure that we make decisions using the most up-to-date information from the CDC and other authorities. We're leveraging our experience in China, where, except for a government-mandated 10-day extension of the Chinese New Year, we operated through the worst of the outbreak. We've taken steps to enhance sanitation protocols in our production facilities and offices, promote social distancing by having employees work at home when possible and canceling almost all travel. 
Second, as a leader in our category, and as I mentioned earlier, we have the obligation to continue to make food and do our part to feed people across the country and around the world, and we take this responsibility seriously. We're confident in our ability to continue to safely produce fries and other frozen potato products. As you can imagine, the demand situation remains fluid so there will undoubtedly be an effect on our operations and supply chain. We're watching consumer and customer demand and have begun to adapt our production schedules to react accordingly. As appropriate, we'll take further actions to align our manufacturing operations, including temporarily reducing production. 
Third, we and our joint venture partners are committed to remaining a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they all manage through supply chain and inventory concerns. Several large QSR chain customers have already indicated to us that fries are a priority item. We and our customers will not likely be able to forecast consumer demand trends given the breadth of the pandemic and the pace under which it continues to unfold. 
However, while good data on the pandemic effect on the restaurant traffic, consumer buying patterns and french fry demand is limited, we can provide some insight into what we've seen so far in some of our markets in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. In China, after the government placed severe social and movement restrictions that significantly reduced restaurant traffic, french fries demand declined about 50% for about a month. As restrictions have relaxed, we've seen volume climb back to about 70% of precrisis demand today. Our team there has responded well and continues to manage through the impact of the virus. We're adopting lessons learned from them to our operations around the world. 
In other key markets in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, we've seen only a modest impact on french fry demand. While our sales in these markets mirror these trends, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation for additional evidence of consumer reaction and fry demand. In the U.S., it's still too early to determine how the impact on demand will play out. 
Normally, about 65% of all fries are purchased at a quick-serve restaurant, with another 20% purchased at a full-serve restaurant. The remaining 15% is purchased at retail. Our sales breakdown is broadly consistent with that split. Our Global segment, which accounts for about 52% of our total sales, primarily serves large QSR chain customers in the U.S. and internationally, largely including Asia, Australia and Mexico. Our Foodservice segment, which is about 30% of sales, primarily sells to a range of foodservice operations. We estimate that close to 80% of the segment sales are to full-service restaurants and outlets, such as workplace cafeterias, hotels, hospitals and schools, with more than 20% to smaller QSRs. Our Retail segment historically accounts for about 13% of our sales. 
Of the fries purchased at QSR, normally about 2/3 have been purchased via drive-through, carryout or delivery, with the remaining 1/3 consumed on premises. Prior to the adoption of more severe social and movement restrictions, we saw little change in orders and shipments to QSRs as increases in drive-through traffic as well as higher delivery orders cushioned much of the decline in on-premise dining. However, with the adoption of more severe restrictions across more states, we're seeing orders beginning to slow. 
If the China experience provides an appropriate guide, then we would expect QSR volumes to begin to recover at a faster rate than for full-service restaurants after the more severe restrictions are relaxed. Traffic at full-service restaurants and operations in the U.S. is expected to be down much more sharply than the QSRs. While many of these operators are taking steps to boost takeout and delivery sales, we expect this will make up only a fraction of lost business. So our sales to these types of customers are more at risk. 
In contrast, retail demand for frozen fries has significantly increased as food at home consumption rises with the adoption of social distancing policies and family stocking their freezers. We've taken steps to boost production of our retail products in order to meet the increased demand. So the bottom line is that, in the U.S., QSRs that have established drive-through, takeout and delivery capabilities are in a much better position in the current environment than full-service restaurants and other outlets that largely cater to dine-in traffic. Retail will likely benefit in the near-term with more meals prepared at home and pantry loading. 
In Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, fry purchasing patterns are much different than in the U.S. Most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway via walk-in traffic since drive-through options are much more limited. The impact of the virus on demand so far has been most pronounced in Italy after it adopted severe social and movement restrictions. Other European nations have since adopted similar restrictions so we expect the decline in demand to accelerate in those countries as well, which will further negatively impact Lamb Weston/Meijer's results. 
Before turning the call over to Rob, I will first talk about our financial liquidity and capital allocation. We have a strong balance sheet and have sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis even if it results in a prolonged downturn in demand. Last week, in an abundance of caution, we fully drew down our existing $500 million revolver in order to provide additional financial flexibility in light of the market uncertainty. 
As you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we temporarily suspended our modest share repurchase program. Finally, we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure, working capital and capital expenditures. This means deferring capital when possible, including postponing all noncritical projects. 
Let me close by saying that these are extraordinary times. Nothing about confronting this pandemic will be easy. But Lamb Weston is well positioned in terms of our business mix, operating flexibility, cost structure and liquidity position to weather the storm. Our entire team is committed to stepping up and doing our part to keep feeding people, support our communities and be a valued stable business partner for our customers. We're taking the necessary actions in our operations to navigate through this crisis by working in close partnership with customers and suppliers across the globe. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,657408075,1949354,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 01, 2020",2020-04-01,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the impact of the pandemic raised across the glob",1021,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the impact of the pandemic raised across the globe, we were on track to deliver the financial targets that we outlined on January 3, 2020. We provided a more detailed description of our third quarter results in our earnings release and in the 10-Q which we'll file later today. 
Here are some brief highlights. Net sales increased 1% due to a 1% increase in price/mix. Volume was flat as growth in Foodservice segment was partially offset by a decline in our Global segment's reported volume. While volume growth of non-customized or limited time offering products in our Global segment was strong, it was more than offset by timing of sales of customized and higher-margin limited time offering products as well as the initial effects of the pandemic on restaurant traffic in China. In addition, acquisitions contributed more than 1 point of volume growth, but this was largely offset by a 1 point decline due to fewer shipping days in the quarter related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Gross profit declined $23 million or 8% primarily due to input and fixed cost inflation. Edible oils drove most of the input cost inflation while higher insurance rates and medical expenses drove most of the increase in fixed costs. In addition, unrealized gains on commodity hedging contracts was a $4 million headwind, largely as a result of a $4 million gain that we realized in the prior year quarter. SG&A expense increased about $8 million and included $2 million of nonrecurring consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. Through the first 9 months, we realized about $6 million in onetime ERP-related costs and expect to spend around $10 million for the year. Regarding our ERP project, we're slowing it down a bit to manage both costs and risk in light of the challenging operating environment at hand. 
Equity method earnings excluding comparability items declined about $2 million, but this was due to a negative $6 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased about $4.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $26 million or 10% to $228 million. Lower sales and gross profit in our base business, which again largely reflected the timing of sales in our Global segment and cost inflation, as well as higher SG&A, drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.18 or 19% to $0.77 due largely to lower sales and operating profits as well as lower equity method earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Our Foodservice and Retail businesses reported in line with our expectations, and you can find the details in our earnings release and 10-Q. But let me touch quickly on our Global segment given the headline performance this quarter. Global's reported sales were down 2%, including a 1% decline in both volume and price/mix. Volume was down primarily because we lapped a very strong growth of customized and limited time product offering products in the prior year quarter. This created about a 7 percentage point volume headwind. The coronavirus-related impact on restaurant traffic in China accounted for an additional 2 points of the volume drop while the timing of Thanksgiving was another 1 point. These declines were nearly offset by a 6-point increase in shipments of non-limited time offering products as well as a 2-point benefit from acquisitions. So after taking into account the timing of sales, the pandemic's impact on restaurant traffic and the benefit from acquisitions, Global's volume in the third quarter was largely in line with the growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. 
Global's price/mix declined 1% as pricing actions were more than offset by unfavorable mix. This was due to lower amount of customized and limited time offering products sold versus the strong sales of these kinds of products in the prior year quarter as well as higher proportion of sales to international customers. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, decreased $20 million or 15%. The factors driving the decline in the segment's profitability, primarily lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, are consistent with what drove our total company's gross profit. 
Moving to our cash flow, liquidity position and balance sheet. We generated about $435 million of cash from operations year-to-date. That's down about 2% versus last year due to increased working capital requirements to support our growth. We've also invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures and IT-related projects year-to-date. For fiscal 2020, we've reduced our CapEx target by $100 million to $200 million as we seek near-term opportunities to preserve liquidity. 
Through the first 9 months, we bought back about $23 million of stock and paid $88 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Tom mentioned, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the current operating environment even if there's a prolonged decline in demand. This includes having more than $500 million of cash on hand after drawing down our revolver last week. 
We have a strong balance sheet with about $2.2 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter. Our maturity profile is also attractive. We have an approximately $280 million balance on a term loan facility that matures in November of 2021 and an approximately $290 million balance on another facility that matures in June 2024. The mandatory annual amortization on these 2 loans is about $30 million combined. In addition, we have 2 $833 million high-yield notes that mature in 2024 and 2026, respectively. 
We're also in good shape with respect to our financial covenants. Our first covenant is to maintain debt-to-EBITDA, including joint ventures, leverage ratio of less than 4.5x. At the end of the third quarter, we were at 2.4x. Our second covenant is in EBITDA, including joint ventures to interest expense ratio of at least 2.75x. At the end of the quarter, we were at nearly 9x. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

One is LTOs, which there's always some level of volatility depending on what customers want to promote and how to promote it. The other is these customized products. And so for a number of our large chain customers in particular, which report in the Global business unit, they're very customized products for those customers. And the way -- and we started reporting under the new revenue recognition standard in first quarter 2019. And under that standard, we recognize the revenue for those customized products when we manufacture it and have a purchase order in hand from those customers as opposed to, traditionally, the way I learned it 30 years ago, of when the product ships and title changes. And so there's some volatility in when we receive purchase orders on those things. 
And so we have some large customers. And if we don't have timely receipt of purchase order, we don't recognize that revenue. And so that's what happened between Global if you look at Q2 to Q3. Q2 wasn't really as good in underlying shipments as what it reflected or was reported, and Q3 wasn't as bad in underlying shipments. And so I think -- and so I want to take that revenue recognition piece out of that. 
In terms of LTOs, interestingly, some of our customers in China are really looking at LTOs and trying to determine when is the right time to launch those to get customer traffic back. And so think about LTOs as a customer traffic incentive, and that's how they use it. And so that's what we're gearing up for now. So I don't think there's anything that would say that customers are or aren't going to use LTOs in the future. In fact, I think, if anything, I think they're going to be used, as we indicated in China, to leverage people back into the stores."

And so those are the kinds of things that you actually have pretty good control over, if that makes sense."

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. 
We're clearly in a time of considerable uncertainty as it relates to the scope and speed of the COVID pandemic and the impact on the global economy, our industry and each of our lives. We'll do our best to answer your questions relating to consumer demand and our response to the crisis, but please recognize that much is still unknown. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we've withdrawn our financial outlook despite only 2 months remaining in our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, it's extremely difficult to reasonably forecast customer and consumer demand in North America in our key international markets. 
In a few minutes, Rob will provide details on our performance for the third quarter, but let me start by sharing with you our priorities as it relates to our Lamb Weston team, our operations and our customers. 
First, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team. I'm proud of how we're managing through this adversity, including all the efforts to protect and support our employees, families, neighbors and local communities; meeting our obligation to continue to provide food to help feed people all over the globe; working with our customers; and continuing to support our business. We're rallying together to care for one another. It's that spirit of teamwork as well as our service-oriented culture that serves as a cornerstone for making Lamb Weston so great. 
It's paramount to ensure the health, safety and emotional well-being of our Lamb Weston team. People must feel safe and comfortable where they work. Since the potential severity of this outbreak became apparent, my management team and I have led a cross-functional task force to ensure that we make decisions using the most up-to-date information from the CDC and other authorities. We're leveraging our experience in China, where, except for a government-mandated 10-day extension of the Chinese New Year, we operated through the worst of the outbreak. We've taken steps to enhance sanitation protocols in our production facilities and offices, promote social distancing by having employees work at home when possible and canceling almost all travel. 
Second, as a leader in our category, and as I mentioned earlier, we have the obligation to continue to make food and do our part to feed people across the country and around the world, and we take this responsibility seriously. We're confident in our ability to continue to safely produce fries and other frozen potato products. As you can imagine, the demand situation remains fluid so there will undoubtedly be an effect on our operations and supply chain. We're watching consumer and customer demand and have begun to adapt our production schedules to react accordingly. As appropriate, we'll take further actions to align our manufacturing operations, including temporarily reducing production. 
Third, we and our joint venture partners are committed to remaining a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they all manage through supply chain and inventory concerns. Several large QSR chain customers have already indicated to us that fries are a priority item. We and our customers will not likely be able to forecast consumer demand trends given the breadth of the pandemic and the pace under which it continues to unfold. 
However, while good data on the pandemic effect on the restaurant traffic, consumer buying patterns and french fry demand is limited, we can provide some insight into what we've seen so far in some of our markets in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. In China, after the government placed severe social and movement restrictions that significantly reduced restaurant traffic, french fries demand declined about 50% for about a month. As restrictions have relaxed, we've seen volume climb back to about 70% of precrisis demand today. Our team there has responded well and continues to manage through the impact of the virus. We're adopting lessons learned from them to our operations around the world. 
In other key markets in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, we've seen only a modest impact on french fry demand. While our sales in these markets mirror these trends, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation for additional evidence of consumer reaction and fry demand. In the U.S., it's still too early to determine how the impact on demand will play out. 
Normally, about 65% of all fries are purchased at a quick-serve restaurant, with another 20% purchased at a full-serve restaurant. The remaining 15% is purchased at retail. Our sales breakdown is broadly consistent with that split. Our Global segment, which accounts for about 52% of our total sales, primarily serves large QSR chain customers in the U.S. and internationally, largely including Asia, Australia and Mexico. Our Foodservice segment, which is about 30% of sales, primarily sells to a range of foodservice operations. We estimate that close to 80% of the segment sales are to full-service restaurants and outlets, such as workplace cafeterias, hotels, hospitals and schools, with more than 20% to smaller QSRs. Our Retail segment historically accounts for about 13% of our sales. 
Of the fries purchased at QSR, normally about 2/3 have been purchased via drive-through, carryout or delivery, with the remaining 1/3 consumed on premises. Prior to the adoption of more severe social and movement restrictions, we saw little change in orders and shipments to QSRs as increases in drive-through traffic as well as higher delivery orders cushioned much of the decline in on-premise dining. However, with the adoption of more severe restrictions across more states, we're seeing orders beginning to slow. 
If the China experience provides an appropriate guide, then we would expect QSR volumes to begin to recover at a faster rate than for full-service restaurants after the more severe restrictions are relaxed. Traffic at full-service restaurants and operations in the U.S. is expected to be down much more sharply than the QSRs. While many of these operators are taking steps to boost takeout and delivery sales, we expect this will make up only a fraction of lost business. So our sales to these types of customers are more at risk. 
In contrast, retail demand for frozen fries has significantly increased as food at home consumption rises with the adoption of social distancing policies and family stocking their freezers. We've taken steps to boost production of our retail products in order to meet the increased demand. So the bottom line is that, in the U.S., QSRs that have established drive-through, takeout and delivery capabilities are in a much better position in the current environment than full-service restaurants and other outlets that largely cater to dine-in traffic. Retail will likely benefit in the near-term with more meals prepared at home and pantry loading. 
In Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, fry purchasing patterns are much different than in the U.S. Most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway via walk-in traffic since drive-through options are much more limited. The impact of the virus on demand so far has been most pronounced in Italy after it adopted severe social and movement restrictions. Other European nations have since adopted similar restrictions so we expect the decline in demand to accelerate in those countries as well, which will further negatively impact Lamb Weston/Meijer's results. 
Before turning the call over to Rob, I will first talk about our financial liquidity and capital allocation. We have a strong balance sheet and have sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis even if it results in a prolonged downturn in demand. Last week, in an abundance of caution, we fully drew down our existing $500 million revolver in order to provide additional financial flexibility in light of the market uncertainty. 
As you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we temporarily suspended our modest share repurchase program. Finally, we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure, working capital and capital expenditures. This means deferring capital when possible, including postponing all noncritical projects. 
Let me close by saying that these are extraordinary times. Nothing about confronting this pandemic will be easy. But Lamb Weston is well positioned in terms of our business mix, operating flexibility, cost structure and liquidity position to weather the storm. Our entire team is committed to stepping up and doing our part to keep feeding people, support our communities and be a valued stable business partner for our customers. We're taking the necessary actions in our operations to navigate through this crisis by working in close partnership with customers and suppliers across the globe. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

We provided a more detailed description of our third quarter results in our earnings release and in the 10-Q which we'll file later today. 
Here are some brief highlights. Net sales increased 1% due to a 1% increase in price/mix. Volume was flat as growth in Foodservice segment was partially offset by a decline in our Global segment's reported volume. While volume growth of non-customized or limited time offering products in our Global segment was strong, it was more than offset by timing of sales of customized and higher-margin limited time offering products as well as the initial effects of the pandemic on restaurant traffic in China. In addition, acquisitions contributed more than 1 point of volume growth, but this was largely offset by a 1 point decline due to fewer shipping days in the quarter related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Gross profit declined $23 million or 8% primarily due to input and fixed cost inflation. Edible oils drove most of the input cost inflation while higher insurance rates and medical expenses drove most of the increase in fixed costs. In addition, unrealized gains on commodity hedging contracts was a $4 million headwind, largely as a result of a $4 million gain that we realized in the prior year quarter. SG&A expense increased about $8 million and included $2 million of nonrecurring consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. Through the first 9 months, we realized about $6 million in onetime ERP-related costs and expect to spend around $10 million for the year. Regarding our ERP project, we're slowing it down a bit to manage both costs and risk in light of the challenging operating environment at hand. 
Equity method earnings excluding comparability items declined about $2 million, but this was due to a negative $6 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased about $4.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $26 million or 10% to $228 million. Lower sales and gross profit in our base business, which again largely reflected the timing of sales in our Global segment and cost inflation, as well as higher SG&A, drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.18 or 19% to $0.77 due largely to lower sales and operating profits as well as lower equity method earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Our Foodservice and Retail businesses reported in line with our expectations, and you can find the details in our earnings release and 10-Q. But let me touch quickly on our Global segment given the headline performance this quarter. Global's reported sales were down 2%, including a 1% decline in both volume and price/mix. Volume was down primarily because we lapped a very strong growth of customized and limited time product offering products in the prior year quarter. This created about a 7 percentage point volume headwind. The coronavirus-related impact on restaurant traffic in China accounted for an additional 2 points of the volume drop while the timing of Thanksgiving was another 1 point. These declines were nearly offset by a 6-point increase in shipments of non-limited time offering products as well as a 2-point benefit from acquisitions. So after taking into account the timing of sales, the pandemic's impact on restaurant traffic and the benefit from acquisitions, Global's volume in the third quarter was largely in line with the growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. 
Global's price/mix declined 1% as pricing actions were more than offset by unfavorable mix. This was due to lower amount of customized and limited time offering products sold versus the strong sales of these kinds of products in the prior year quarter as well as higher proportion of sales to international customers. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, decreased $20 million or 15%. The factors driving the decline in the segment's profitability, primarily lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, are consistent with what drove our total company's gross profit. 
Moving to our cash flow, liquidity position and balance sheet. We generated about $435 million of cash from operations year-to-date. That's down about 2% versus last year due to increased working capital requirements to support our growth. We've also invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures and IT-related projects year-to-date. For fiscal 2020, we've reduced our CapEx target by $100 million to $200 million as we seek near-term opportunities to preserve liquidity. 
Through the first 9 months, we bought back about $23 million of stock and paid $88 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Tom mentioned, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the current operating environment even if there's a prolonged decline in demand. This includes having more than $500 million of cash on hand after drawing down our revolver last week. 
We have a strong balance sheet with about $2.2 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter. Our maturity profile is also attractive. We have an approximately $280 million balance on a term loan facility that matures in November of 2021 and an approximately $290 million balance on another facility that matures in June 2024. The mandatory annual amortization on these 2 loans is about $30 million combined. In addition, we have 2 $833 million high-yield notes that mature in 2024 and 2026, respectively. 
We're also in good shape with respect to our financial covenants. Our first covenant is to maintain debt-to-EBITDA, including joint ventures, leverage ratio of less than 4.5x. At the end of the third quarter, we were at 2.4x. Our second covenant is in EBITDA, including joint ventures to interest expense ratio of at least 2.75x. At the end of the quarter, we were at nearly 9x. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And the indication that I talked -- that I'll talk about is -- the fact that I do know is what we're seeing in China. So we had a downturn. We got through the worst of the crisis over there, at least as we know it today. Production went down 50%. It's running at about 70% demand. So as I think about the market, it's all about assured supply, keeping our people safe, producing food safely, all those things. And it's going to take time to see how this all plays out."

One is LTOs, which there's always some level of volatility depending on what customers want to promote and how to promote it. The other is these customized products. And so for a number of our large chain customers in particular, which report in the Global business unit, they're very customized products for those customers. And the way -- and we started reporting under the new revenue recognition standard in first quarter 2019. And under that standard, we recognize the revenue for those customized products when we manufacture it and have a purchase order in hand from those customers as opposed to, traditionally, the way I learned it 30 years ago, of when the product ships and title changes. And so there's some volatility in when we receive purchase orders on those things. 
And so we have some large customers. And if we don't have timely receipt of purchase order, we don't recognize that revenue. And so that's what happened between Global if you look at Q2 to Q3. Q2 wasn't really as good in underlying shipments as what it reflected or was reported, and Q3 wasn't as bad in underlying shipments. And so I think -- and so I want to take that revenue recognition piece out of that. 
In terms of LTOs, interestingly, some of our customers in China are really looking at LTOs and trying to determine when is the right time to launch those to get customer traffic back. And so think about LTOs as a customer traffic incentive, and that's how they use it. And so that's what we're gearing up for now. So I don't think there's anything that would say that customers are or aren't going to use LTOs in the future. In fact, I think, if anything, I think they're going to be used, as we indicated in China, to leverage people back into the stores."

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. 
We're clearly in a time of considerable uncertainty as it relates to the scope and speed of the COVID pandemic and the impact on the global economy, our industry and each of our lives. We'll do our best to answer your questions relating to consumer demand and our response to the crisis, but please recognize that much is still unknown. As a consequence of this uncertainty, we've withdrawn our financial outlook despite only 2 months remaining in our fiscal fourth quarter. At this time, it's extremely difficult to reasonably forecast customer and consumer demand in North America in our key international markets. 
In a few minutes, Rob will provide details on our performance for the third quarter, but let me start by sharing with you our priorities as it relates to our Lamb Weston team, our operations and our customers. 
First, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team. I'm proud of how we're managing through this adversity, including all the efforts to protect and support our employees, families, neighbors and local communities; meeting our obligation to continue to provide food to help feed people all over the globe; working with our customers; and continuing to support our business. We're rallying together to care for one another. It's that spirit of teamwork as well as our service-oriented culture that serves as a cornerstone for making Lamb Weston so great. 
It's paramount to ensure the health, safety and emotional well-being of our Lamb Weston team. People must feel safe and comfortable where they work. Since the potential severity of this outbreak became apparent, my management team and I have led a cross-functional task force to ensure that we make decisions using the most up-to-date information from the CDC and other authorities. We're leveraging our experience in China, where, except for a government-mandated 10-day extension of the Chinese New Year, we operated through the worst of the outbreak. We've taken steps to enhance sanitation protocols in our production facilities and offices, promote social distancing by having employees work at home when possible and canceling almost all travel. 
Second, as a leader in our category, and as I mentioned earlier, we have the obligation to continue to make food and do our part to feed people across the country and around the world, and we take this responsibility seriously. We're confident in our ability to continue to safely produce fries and other frozen potato products. As you can imagine, the demand situation remains fluid so there will undoubtedly be an effect on our operations and supply chain. We're watching consumer and customer demand and have begun to adapt our production schedules to react accordingly. As appropriate, we'll take further actions to align our manufacturing operations, including temporarily reducing production. 
Third, we and our joint venture partners are committed to remaining a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they all manage through supply chain and inventory concerns. Several large QSR chain customers have already indicated to us that fries are a priority item. We and our customers will not likely be able to forecast consumer demand trends given the breadth of the pandemic and the pace under which it continues to unfold. 
However, while good data on the pandemic effect on the restaurant traffic, consumer buying patterns and french fry demand is limited, we can provide some insight into what we've seen so far in some of our markets in Asia, the U.S. and Europe. In China, after the government placed severe social and movement restrictions that significantly reduced restaurant traffic, french fries demand declined about 50% for about a month. As restrictions have relaxed, we've seen volume climb back to about 70% of precrisis demand today. Our team there has responded well and continues to manage through the impact of the virus. We're adopting lessons learned from them to our operations around the world. 
In other key markets in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, we've seen only a modest impact on french fry demand. While our sales in these markets mirror these trends, we're continuing to closely monitor the situation for additional evidence of consumer reaction and fry demand. In the U.S., it's still too early to determine how the impact on demand will play out. 
Normally, about 65% of all fries are purchased at a quick-serve restaurant, with another 20% purchased at a full-serve restaurant. The remaining 15% is purchased at retail. Our sales breakdown is broadly consistent with that split. Our Global segment, which accounts for about 52% of our total sales, primarily serves large QSR chain customers in the U.S. and internationally, largely including Asia, Australia and Mexico. Our Foodservice segment, which is about 30% of sales, primarily sells to a range of foodservice operations. We estimate that close to 80% of the segment sales are to full-service restaurants and outlets, such as workplace cafeterias, hotels, hospitals and schools, with more than 20% to smaller QSRs. Our Retail segment historically accounts for about 13% of our sales. 
Of the fries purchased at QSR, normally about 2/3 have been purchased via drive-through, carryout or delivery, with the remaining 1/3 consumed on premises. Prior to the adoption of more severe social and movement restrictions, we saw little change in orders and shipments to QSRs as increases in drive-through traffic as well as higher delivery orders cushioned much of the decline in on-premise dining. However, with the adoption of more severe restrictions across more states, we're seeing orders beginning to slow. 
If the China experience provides an appropriate guide, then we would expect QSR volumes to begin to recover at a faster rate than for full-service restaurants after the more severe restrictions are relaxed. Traffic at full-service restaurants and operations in the U.S. is expected to be down much more sharply than the QSRs. While many of these operators are taking steps to boost takeout and delivery sales, we expect this will make up only a fraction of lost business. So our sales to these types of customers are more at risk. 
In contrast, retail demand for frozen fries has significantly increased as food at home consumption rises with the adoption of social distancing policies and family stocking their freezers. We've taken steps to boost production of our retail products in order to meet the increased demand. So the bottom line is that, in the U.S., QSRs that have established drive-through, takeout and delivery capabilities are in a much better position in the current environment than full-service restaurants and other outlets that largely cater to dine-in traffic. Retail will likely benefit in the near-term with more meals prepared at home and pantry loading. 
In Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, fry purchasing patterns are much different than in the U.S. Most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway via walk-in traffic since drive-through options are much more limited. The impact of the virus on demand so far has been most pronounced in Italy after it adopted severe social and movement restrictions. Other European nations have since adopted similar restrictions so we expect the decline in demand to accelerate in those countries as well, which will further negatively impact Lamb Weston/Meijer's results. 
Before turning the call over to Rob, I will first talk about our financial liquidity and capital allocation. We have a strong balance sheet and have sufficient liquidity to weather this crisis even if it results in a prolonged downturn in demand. Last week, in an abundance of caution, we fully drew down our existing $500 million revolver in order to provide additional financial flexibility in light of the market uncertainty. 
As you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we temporarily suspended our modest share repurchase program. Finally, we'll take the necessary actions to manage our cost structure, working capital and capital expenditures. This means deferring capital when possible, including postponing all noncritical projects. 
Let me close by saying that these are extraordinary times. Nothing about confronting this pandemic will be easy. But Lamb Weston is well positioned in terms of our business mix, operating flexibility, cost structure and liquidity position to weather the storm. Our entire team is committed to stepping up and doing our part to keep feeding people, support our communities and be a valued stable business partner for our customers. We're taking the necessary actions in our operations to navigate through this crisis by working in close partnership with customers and suppliers across the globe. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed.

As you've seen in our earnings release, our reported performance in third quarter was mixed. However, it's important to note that through February, which was before the impact of the pandemic raised across the globe, we were on track to deliver the financial targets that we outlined on January 3, 2020. We provided a more detailed description of our third quarter results in our earnings release and in the 10-Q which we'll file later today. 
Here are some brief highlights. Net sales increased 1% due to a 1% increase in price/mix. Volume was flat as growth in Foodservice segment was partially offset by a decline in our Global segment's reported volume. While volume growth of non-customized or limited time offering products in our Global segment was strong, it was more than offset by timing of sales of customized and higher-margin limited time offering products as well as the initial effects of the pandemic on restaurant traffic in China. In addition, acquisitions contributed more than 1 point of volume growth, but this was largely offset by a 1 point decline due to fewer shipping days in the quarter related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Gross profit declined $23 million or 8% primarily due to input and fixed cost inflation. Edible oils drove most of the input cost inflation while higher insurance rates and medical expenses drove most of the increase in fixed costs. In addition, unrealized gains on commodity hedging contracts was a $4 million headwind, largely as a result of a $4 million gain that we realized in the prior year quarter. SG&A expense increased about $8 million and included $2 million of nonrecurring consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system. Through the first 9 months, we realized about $6 million in onetime ERP-related costs and expect to spend around $10 million for the year. Regarding our ERP project, we're slowing it down a bit to manage both costs and risk in light of the challenging operating environment at hand. 
Equity method earnings excluding comparability items declined about $2 million, but this was due to a negative $6 million change in unrealized mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, equity earnings increased about $4.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $26 million or 10% to $228 million. Lower sales and gross profit in our base business, which again largely reflected the timing of sales in our Global segment and cost inflation, as well as higher SG&A, drove the decline. Adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.18 or 19% to $0.77 due largely to lower sales and operating profits as well as lower equity method earnings. 
Moving to our segments. Our Foodservice and Retail businesses reported in line with our expectations, and you can find the details in our earnings release and 10-Q. But let me touch quickly on our Global segment given the headline performance this quarter. Global's reported sales were down 2%, including a 1% decline in both volume and price/mix. Volume was down primarily because we lapped a very strong growth of customized and limited time product offering products in the prior year quarter. This created about a 7 percentage point volume headwind. The coronavirus-related impact on restaurant traffic in China accounted for an additional 2 points of the volume drop while the timing of Thanksgiving was another 1 point. These declines were nearly offset by a 6-point increase in shipments of non-limited time offering products as well as a 2-point benefit from acquisitions. So after taking into account the timing of sales, the pandemic's impact on restaurant traffic and the benefit from acquisitions, Global's volume in the third quarter was largely in line with the growth that we delivered in the first half of the year. 
Global's price/mix declined 1% as pricing actions were more than offset by unfavorable mix. This was due to lower amount of customized and limited time offering products sold versus the strong sales of these kinds of products in the prior year quarter as well as higher proportion of sales to international customers. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expense, decreased $20 million or 15%. The factors driving the decline in the segment's profitability, primarily lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, are consistent with what drove our total company's gross profit. 
Moving to our cash flow, liquidity position and balance sheet. We generated about $435 million of cash from operations year-to-date. That's down about 2% versus last year due to increased working capital requirements to support our growth. We've also invested more than $150 million in capital expenditures and IT-related projects year-to-date. For fiscal 2020, we've reduced our CapEx target by $100 million to $200 million as we seek near-term opportunities to preserve liquidity. 
Through the first 9 months, we bought back about $23 million of stock and paid $88 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Tom mentioned, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to weather the current operating environment even if there's a prolonged decline in demand. This includes having more than $500 million of cash on hand after drawing down our revolver last week. 
We have a strong balance sheet with about $2.2 billion of total debt at the end of the quarter. Our maturity profile is also attractive. We have an approximately $280 million balance on a term loan facility that matures in November of 2021 and an approximately $290 million balance on another facility that matures in June 2024. The mandatory annual amortization on these 2 loans is about $30 million combined. In addition, we have 2 $833 million high-yield notes that mature in 2024 and 2026, respectively. 
We're also in good shape with respect to our financial covenants. Our first covenant is to maintain debt-to-EBITDA, including joint ventures, leverage ratio of less than 4.5x. At the end of the third quarter, we were at 2.4x. Our second covenant is in EBITDA, including joint ventures to interest expense ratio of at least 2.75x. At the end of the quarter, we were at nearly 9x. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And the indication that I talked -- that I'll talk about is -- the fact that I do know is what we're seeing in China. So we had a downturn. We got through the worst of the crisis over there, at least as we know it today. Production went down 50%. It's running at about 70% demand. So as I think about the market, it's all about assured supply, keeping our people safe, producing food safely, all those things. And it's going to take time to see how this all plays out."

One is LTOs, which there's always some level of volatility depending on what customers want to promote and how to promote it. The other is these customized products. And so for a number of our large chain customers in particular, which report in the Global business unit, they're very customized products for those customers. And the way -- and we started reporting under the new revenue recognition standard in first quarter 2019. And under that standard, we recognize the revenue for those customized products when we manufacture it and have a purchase order in hand from those customers as opposed to, traditionally, the way I learned it 30 years ago, of when the product ships and title changes. And so there's some volatility in when we receive purchase orders on those things. 
And so we have some large customers. And if we don't have timely receipt of purchase order, we don't recognize that revenue. And so that's what happened between Global if you look at Q2 to Q3. Q2 wasn't really as good in underlying shipments as what it reflected or was reported, and Q3 wasn't as bad in underlying shipments. And so I think -- and so I want to take that revenue recognition piece out of that. 
In terms of LTOs, interestingly, some of our customers in China are really looking at LTOs and trying to determine when is the right time to launch those to get customer traffic back. And so think about LTOs as a customer traffic incentive, and that's how they use it. And so that's what we're gearing up for now. So I don't think there's anything that would say that customers are or aren't going to use LTOs in the future. In fact, I think, if anything, I think they're going to be used, as we indicated in China, to leverage people back into the stores."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before getting into our performance in the quarter, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their commitment to support our communities, our customers and our consumers during these trying times, while keeping themselves and their colleagues safe. We should be proud of doing our part to help feed people around the world. It's their commitment and spirit of teamwork that makes me so honored to be part of this great company. 
Now let me turn to the performance. The final month of fiscal 2020 were some of the most challenging in Lamb Weston's history. After starting to realize the impact of government efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus in China on our local operations in February, we saw a more severe effect on our overall business, beginning in late March as governments in the U.S. and Europe took actions to try to slow the spread of the virus. 
These government restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice businesses abruptly and significantly reduced restaurant traffic and the demand for fries. In addition, the initial drop in demand was so steep and quick that customers needed to adjust inventory levels, which further reduced our shipments. As a result, our sales and earnings fell in the fourth quarter. 
Starting in May, U.S. demand for fries began to recover, and that improvement has continued through mid-July. The recovery has been led by quick service restaurants as consumers leveraged drive-through options. By the end of June, QSR traffic rebounded significantly. As expected, full-service restaurants were affected much more severely than QSRs. They adapted by increasing carryout and delivery options. And starting in late may, consumer traffic began to increase as certain state government gradually ease restrictions to allow for more on-premise dining. However, while steadily improving, our shipments to this channel currently remain well below prior year levels. 
Fry demand by our non commercial customers, such as hotels, schools, universities and sporting venues, was hit hard as traffic at these outlets suffered. Our shipments to these customers remain very soft and will likely remain so until a pandemic ends and consumer confidence improves. 
In contrast, consumers sharply stepped up food at home purchases in the fourth quarter and retail purchases remain a bright spot for the category and for Lamb Weston. Fry demand in Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also improved since the end of May. Although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway since drive-thru options are much more limited. These QSRs act more like full service restaurants. 
Like in the U.S., weekly shipments bottomed in April, and they have steadily improved since in but currently remain well below pre-COVID levels. Fry demand in our other key international markets has been mixed. China's recovery has been solid with our weekly shipments in July approaching pre-COVID levels. Demand in Asia outside of China has been varied, but consumption overall has held up better than in the U.S. and Europe. 
Consumption in Latin America, including Mexico, held up relatively well in the fourth quarter but began to soften at the end of May. We have been encouraged by the breadth and the pace of recovery in fry demand. It's been faster than we anticipated when the crisis first arose. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the recovery sustainability. For example, recent actions by California and Texas to reimpose restrictions on restaurants and foodservice outlets as well as New York City's decision to postpone lifting restrictions for on-premise dining illustrate how volatile and fragile the U.S. recovery and demand can be. 
Because of this uncertainty, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Instead, Rob will detail later, we're providing trends in our shipments that we have observed so far during our fiscal first quarter. 
Managing through this crisis has been difficult, and I'm proud of how we're executing on a range of priorities and actions to navigate the business in the current environment and position us for success as demand continues to recover. First, we're prioritizing the health and safety of our Lamb Weston team and have adopted enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations. Nonetheless, we've had a number of production employees contract the virus, which has required us to temporarily shut down manufacturing lines to be sanitized. Unfortunately, the possibility of temporarily shutting down lines remains a risk until the virus is under control. We're always seeking ways to improve testing processes that can help us identify affected employees before they show up for work. The safety of our employees has and will continue to be our #1 priority. 
Second, we're working to remain a trusted and value business partner for our customers as they manage their supply chains and commercial operations. For example, for our larger chain restaurant customers, we've helped them manage inventory levels in a time of heightened volatility. We've also begun to help customers identify the best price for delivery and carryout as well as develop limited time offering products that would be available as soon as this fall in the U.S. For independent operators, our direct sales force has been a real asset in allowing us to stay close with customers to identify the appropriate products for simplified menus, creatively broaden our fry offerings and react quickly to customer needs in this volatile market. 
Third, we're adapting our manufacturing operations to meet the new demand environment. While necessary, our actions in the resulting disruption has come at the cost during the quarter. For example, we've incurred incremental costs to redirect certain manufacturing lines to make retail products. We've also adjusted production schedules and run times in an effort to spread production across our network and key factory employees on payroll. 
Since the demand environment remains fluid, we'll continue to evaluate further actions to align our manufacturing operations as appropriate. However, meeting customer demand with a workforce that's being affected by the virus creates a difficult scheduling exercise for our manufacturing team, which will continue to make capacity and cost management challenging. 
Finally, we've significantly enhanced our liquidity position by securing additional debt financing and taking steps to preserve cash. Based on these actions and our ability to generate cash, we feel confident enough about our liquidity that we fully repaid the borrowings under our credit facility in July. 
In summary, we believe that by executing on these priorities and actions, we're positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in fiscal 2021 and to emerge as a stronger company once we're on the other side of this virus. 
Before handing off the call to Rob, let me quickly update you on a couple of items. With respect to this year's potato crop at this point, the crops in our North America growing areas and in Europe are consistent with historical averages. As usual, we'll have more insight on the yield and quality of the crop after the harvest takes place later in the year. 
With respect to our customer contract negotiations, we're encouraged by how the discussions have been progressing and have already finalized a handful of the global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts. For those remaining contracts, we'll remain disciplined in taking approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. 
So as you can see in the near term, we're taking the necessary actions across our manufacturing, commercial and support teams to navigate the prices, including, most importantly, prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees and partnering with our customers and suppliers across the globe. 
We're facing an unprecedented challenging and volatile operating environment that will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but we remain confident in our strategies in the long-term health and structure of the category. 
Let me turn the call over to Rob."

Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemics effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While",2415,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemics effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. 
While the quarter was highly challenging, we've seen improvements in recent months from the lows we saw in April. We believe that we're well positioned to manage through the continuing recovery. 
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 16%, including the benefit of an additional week of sales versus the prior year. Excluding that benefit, sales declined 22%. Sales volume was down 17% or 23%, excluding the extra week, as frozen potato demand at restaurants and other foodservice outlets fell sharply in the last 2 months of the quarter following government-imposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic. 
The volume decline also reflects inventory destocking by chain restaurant and foodservice customers in April through mid-May as they adjusted to the abrupt drop in near-term demand. 
Our weekly shipments towards the end of the quarter more closely mirrored consumer demand trends by channel, but we're still down versus the prior year. Specifically, our weekly shipments to large chain restaurants in the U.S. were about 50% of pre-COVID levels from late March through early April, then improved to around 85% by the end of May as consumers took advantage of QSR drive-throughs. 
Our weekly shipments to full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, such as hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues and workplace cafeterias, bottomed at about 20% of pre-COVID levels in mid-April, then improve to approximately 70% by the end of May as some states begin to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars. 
In contrast, our retail segment's weekly shipments in April through mid-May spiked up around 50% versus prior year as consumers increased food at home purchases in response to shelter-in-place orders. Demand were plained high as we exited the quarter with weekly shipments growth of about 30%. 
Price/mix increased 1% for the total company, with gains in retail partially offsetting unfavorable mix in our global and foodservice segments. For the year, sales were up 1%, including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding that benefit, sales were down 1%. 
Gross profit in the quarter declined $139 million. This included about $47 million of cost related to the pandemics impact on our operations. In the quarter, we elected to keep all of our plants open and continue to pay our employees and therefore, spread reduced demand across the entire system. This led to all of our plants operating at lower rates, resulting in labor, energy and materials utilization levels that were well off of our standards. Accordingly, this had a significant impact on our margins. 
Of the $47 million, about $25 million reflects utilization-related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. These costs and inefficiencies largely consisted of, first, spreading lower volume across our entire manufacturing network, their including modifying production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing utilization at each facility. Second, cost led by any government credits to retain factory labor, including paying them full weekly wages, although hours work may have been well below that. Third, cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities after a factory employee had tested positive for the virus. And finally, incremental cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines. 
To be clear, we expect to incur utilization-related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing operations are impacted by the pandemic, especially with respect to disruptions arising from shutting down and sanitizing facilities, including the cost of shifting production to non-affected locations. 
The other $22 million of the $47 million consists of non-utilization-related costs, which largely included nearly $14 million, of which $10 million in the quarter was noncash determinate certain raw potato purchase obligations related to the 2019 crop, nearly $6 million of incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs, and about $3 million of other costs. We expect over half of these non-utilization-related costs will be nonrecurring. 
While these pandemic-related costs had a pronounced impact on our results for the quarter, the remaining $92 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes as well as higher manufacturing costs due to unfavorable mix, other inefficiencies and input cost inflation. 
We partially offset the decline in gross profit by a $22 million reduction in SG&A expense, which was largely driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and adopting a broad range of cost mitigation efforts. We also reduced advertising and promotional expense by $5 million, primarily related to our retail segment and suspended contributions to our charitable foundation in order to preserve cash. 
Partially offsetting these SG&A reductions were $11 million of expenses related to the pandemic, which largely included expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols; expenses, net of government credits to retain certain direct sales employees in our foodservice segment so that we're in a better position to drive growth as demand improves; and expensing more than $3 million of capitalized costs associated with manufacturing expansion -- manufacturing expansion projects that were shelved for the time being. We expect to incur some of the pandemic-related SG&A expenses going forward, especially for maintaining enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols. 
Equity method earnings swung to a loss of $6 million, down from a positive $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $25 million, of which about $16 million reflects pandemic-related costs and expenses similar to what we incurred in our base business. The remaining $9 million of the decline was largely driven by lower sales, primarily in Europe. 
As Tom mentioned, the pandemic's effect on European fry brand was similar to what we saw for full-service restaurants in the U.S., with Lamb Weston/Meijer ship -- weekly shipments bottoming in April at about 35% of prior year levels and recovering to around 60% by the end of May. 
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $137 million to $78 million, about $74 million of the decline was due to the pandemic-related costs and expenses that I previously discussed, which included $58 million in our base business and $16 million at our unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales, higher manufacturing costs and lower equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures was about $800 million, down 12%. 
Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.01, down from $0.74 last year. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.50, down 22%. 
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 18% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2%, largely due to unfavorable customer and product mix, including the impact of lower sales of limited-time offering products. 
Volume fell 16%. This was due to the sharp drop-off in U.S. consumer demand and inventory destocking, with weekly shipments to large chain customers as low as 50% of prior year levels in mid-April and rebounding to about 85% by the end of May. 
International sales were mixed. In China, monthly shipments in March recovered to nearly 70% of pre-COVID monthly run rate and recovered to about 80% in May. Monthly shipments to other markets in Asia, Australia and Mexico were 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels through late April, but began to soften by the end of the quarter in certain markets due to inventory destocking. 
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less A&P expense, declined $77 million to $34 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for $29 million of the decline, with the remainder primarily driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing costs. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and chain restaurants outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 44% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% due to unfavorable mix as sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products softened. Price alone was positive, reflecting the pricing actions that we've taken last fall. 
Volume declined 42%, reflecting the severe impact of the shutdown had on full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, including customers destocking inventories in April through early May. By the end of May, our weekly shipment rate had recovered to around 70% of prior year levels. 
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined $66 million to $43 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $8 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing costs. 
Sales in our Retail segment increased 56% in the quarter. Volume increased 39%. As we discussed earlier, our weekly shipments have been strong since late March, led by demand for our mainstream branded products such as grown in Idaho as well as for our premium branded products. Price/mix increased 17%, largely driven by favorable mix and pricing actions. 
Retail's product contribution margin increased $10 million to $31 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by $10 million of pandemic-related costs. 
Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Since the pandemic crisis began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by drawing $495 million from our previously undrawn credit facility, entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt was less than $2.2 billion, which is down nearly $140 million from the end of last year, and we had about $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. 
As Tom mentioned, based on these actions and efforts to generate and preserve cash, we feel confident enough in our liquidity that in July, we fully repaid the $495 million that we've drawn on our credit facility. 
With respect to cash flow, for the year, we generated about $575 million of cash from operations. That's down more than $100 million versus last year with the decline in earnings. Nonetheless, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $140 million of cash from operations. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. 
For fiscal 2021, we currently expect capital expenditures of about $140 million as we conduct appropriate plant maintenance and implement Phase 1 of our new ERP system. 
With respect to capital returns, as you may have seen last week, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we continue to suspend our share repurchase program due to the current operating environment. 
Now turning to fiscal 2021. As we've noted, we're not providing an outlook for the year because of the unpredictable effect of the pandemic on fry demand in North America and our key international markets. 
The business environment remains volatile, especially in the U.S., where increases in COVID cases have recently led government authorities in a number of states to reinstate restrictions on restaurant and foodservice outlets. We believe these actions may slow or possibly even reverse some of the recovery in fry demand. 
Instead of providing near-term financial targets, we're providing a summary of our shipments during the first 7 weeks or just more than half of our fiscal first quarter. In aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments has improved since the end of May. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large chain restaurant customers, which are predominantly QSRs, have recovered to 85% to 90% of prior year levels during the most recent weeks of the quarter. In our Foodservice segment, which is largely full-service restaurants and other noncommercial customers, weekly shipments during the most recent weeks have been 70% to 75% of prior year levels, including solid recovery in sales of Lamb Weston branded products. 
Weekly shipments to Retail customers in the most recent weeks have been 5% to 10% more than prior year levels as food-at-home purchases begin to normalize pre-COVID rates. Our growth has been led by our branded products. 
In Europe, shipments to date by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture are around 75% of prior year levels. Early in the quarter, weekly shipments were trending at more than 65% and have recovered to around 80% in the most recent weeks as more countries ease restrictions and consumers gain confidence about dining and restaurants. 
In China, which is included in our Global segment, shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels, with monthly shipments improving from about 80% in May to more than 95% in the most recent weeks. Demand in our other key international markets, which are also included in our Global segment, has softened since the end of the fourth quarter. In Japan, customers have been destocking inventories due to postponement of the Olympics. 
In sum, the amount and pace of recovery in fry demand has been better than what we had anticipated when the crisis first arose. QSRs in the U.S. have bounced back faster than we expected, while full-service restaurants have also recovered somewhat faster due to state's easing restrictions. 
Demand in Europe and China has progressed largely in line with our expectations, while other international markets are a bit softer. However, to be clear, we believe that this improvement remains fragile as COVID cases continue to rise in the U.S. and in Latin America. We are currently seeing evidence of orders slowing after some states recently placed restrictions for on-premise dining at restaurants. We expect that this high degree of uncertainty will likely continue until the pandemic has ended and consumer confidence has been restored. 
With respect to costs, as Tom discussed, we've taken a range of actions to reduce our cost profile. We'd expect to continue to incur incremental costs and expenses, resulting from the pandemic impact on our operations. For example, these include expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols throughout the company; cost to modify production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing plant and labor utilization; cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities when necessary; and cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines. 
So as you can see, it was a challenging quarter where we've executed well and took the necessary actions to maintain through a potentially volatile period going forward. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

We believe that the tough decisions we made and the actions we've taken have us well positioned for fiscal 2021 and beyond. 
The recovery in demand these past few months has been encouraging, with solid improvements in most of our channels, especially at QSRs. While we expect there will be some bumps on the road to recovery, we'll continue to overcome them as the year progresses. 
Our long-term view remains the same, and we remain confident in our strategies, our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and create value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

But I was hopeful that you could provide a little bit more color on what you've seen from that new approach? What you're seeing that's been encouraging?

And what's manageable today is different tomorrow, it's different yesterday. But we do have a lens of future demand based on orders in the system. Now it's narrowed down a lot from what it used to be just because of the uncertainty in the channels. So it's -- again, it's ensuring as best we can with the disruptions we're having in our manufacturing plants, making sure we've got taking care of the key customers. Certainly, we're having some challenges with the plant shut down, but the demand signal -- we look at a lot of data, just like every other company, the demand signal is the key that's going to drive the near-term going forward. Certainly, when we have some of these contracts done and behind us, that's helpful, but that's not necessarily an indicator on the demand forecast because the historical demand that we would have with these big customers has completely changed. So we're hand to mouth right now on what they're seeing in their store and store traffic. 
As you can imagine, with the things that are going on in the environment, in the U.S. specifically of some of our bigger markets that are -- have more spikes in cases and more restrictions, the signal is mixed. So -- but the encouraging thing to all this is over the past 6, 8 weeks, as Rob alluded to, the things we look at, it's hanging in there pretty well across all of our channels. But the whole key to this is demand signal. And we look at a lot of different data. We certainly have a lens on what our forward orders look like. But the outlook period is a lot shorter than what it used to be. But we're monitoring it closely."

And I'm just trying to really think about those incremental kind of production costs that you laid out in the press release and how much of that was more onetime? How much of that is more recurring as long as you've got this kind of the COVID issues playing? And maybe finally, how would you frame how to think about the decremental gross margins as your volumes are certainly still down year-on-year, just over the next the 3 months to 12 months?"

And if you look at that $22 million, $14 million of that was related to the 20 -- or the 2019 crop write-off. And so there may be some tweaking and true-up here in Q1 as we finalize those discussions with the growers. But not likely that, that's going to recur in our minds. Transportation, warehousing, inefficiencies may have some recurrence of some of that, but hopefully, we would -- the steps we've taken to improve and the additional volume pushing through that we're getting should help that as well. And then you go to the utilization costs and really, that's the tough -- that's the one that's really tough to forecast because that's largely driven by really jerking around production schedules. So think about it as we've got a production schedule in a plant to go run couple of people show up after a long weekend with COVID. And we don't have enough people, and we don't have the assurance to continue to run that line and keep people safe and healthy. And so we then take step to shut that down. I have no idea how to forecast that. And so that's one that you look at that $25 million and it's hard for me to get my head around, but we're not going to continue to incur some of those costs. And I'll tell you, in Q1, we have had some additional hits and some shutdowns and restarts and sanitization. So that's the way I think about it. I know it's not perfect information, but I think that's a reality of what we're dealing with here."

Obviously, you go back to March everyone's kind of flying blindly, right? You had to put in the orders with the growers for the 2020 harvest. It sounds like not only you, but other larger players in the industry kind of pulled back temporarily on capacity, like you're saying there's some line shifts that were required from food service to retail, et cetera. But like where you sit now, looking forward for this year versus where you were a couple of months ago?  Kind of holistically in terms of 2019 inventory rolling off 2020 crop yields, you mentioned currently demand, obviously, is still a question mark. But kind of overall, do you feel like all things considered, we're actually not in a bad spot. We think that maybe, hopefully, the worst is behind us. And what we saw in Q4, hopefully, right, would be worse. And now we can kind of work our way back because demand has a crater, the harvest seems okay, contracts lower, supply orders actually came in decently. And basically, our forecasting might actually prove out to be okay, and we might actually be in a pretty good spot once we get to the end of the year. I mean, that's the hope. So just kind of any overarching comments on kind of state of the industry and where you think you're positioned?"

We certainly have our challenges that the team and the landwide employees are working through in our operations. We're continuing to enhance safety protocols for our employees.

In terms of SG&A costs, again, as I spoke to, that we'll continue to maintain a pretty tight handle on SG&A. We have the release 1 that will go live here in the first of September. And so we're currently incurring some training costs related to that. But that's the only element of SG&A that, I would say, would be anything that's outside the norm, and that's going to be in the sub-$10 million.

In terms of those costs, again, I think that as you look through those, I broke them down into the $25 million related to utilization and the $22 million that was not related to utilization. Of that $22 million, again, a big chunk of that was related to raw write-off related to 2019 crop and settling those contracts. And so I would not expect anything material out of that to recur or extend other than there may be some minor true-ups here that we clean up in Q1, but it's going to be much smaller than what we saw previously. And then I said there were some capital write-offs that we had in the quarter that don't anticipate those will recur. And then transportation warehousing said that expect those to improve versus what we saw in Q4 may still have some, but they'll be better. 
On the utilization costs, the $25 million of utilization costs, as Tom and I talked through, it's really tough to predict and to forecast what's going to happen because those are largely driven by a couple of things. One, what's happening on the demand signal; and two, what's happening in terms of employee health as a show up for work. We can keep them safe at work and keep them healthy at work. But outside of work as they circulate in the community, they may get sick, and so we may have unexpected shutdowns of plants. And so that's what's driving that $25 million is that utilization that is tied to both of those issues. So that's the one that I would expect we'll have some recurrence. Hopefully, we're getting better and smarter at managing those costs. But that's the one where there's a risk, I think."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before getting into our performance in the quarter, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their commitment to support our communities, our customers and our consumers during these trying times, while keeping themselves and their colleagues safe. We should be proud of doing our part to help feed people around the world. It's their commitment and spirit of teamwork that makes me so honored to be part of this great company.
Now let me turn to the performance. The final months of fiscal 2020 were some of the most challenging in Lamb Weston's history. After starting to realize the impact of government efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus in China on our local operations in February, we saw a more severe effect on our overall business beginning in late March as governments in the U.S. and Europe took actions to try to slow the spread of the virus. These government restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice businesses abruptly and significantly reduced restaurant traffic and the demand for fries. In addition, the initial drop in demand was so steep and quick that customers needed to adjust inventory levels, which further reduced our shipments. As a result, our sales and earnings fell in the fourth quarter.
Starting in May, U.S. demand for fries began to recover, and that improvement has continued through mid-July. The recovery has been led by quick-service restaurants as consumers leveraged drive-through options. By the end of June, QSR traffic rebounded significantly. As expected, full-service restaurants were affected much more severely than QSRs. They adapted by increasing carryout and delivery options. And starting in late May, consumer traffic began to increase as certain state governments gradually eased restrictions to allow for more on-premise dining. However, while steadily improving, our shipments to this channel currently remain well below prior year levels.
Fry demand by our noncommercial customers, such as hotels, schools, universities and sporting venues, was hit hard as traffic at these outlets suffered. Our shipments to these customers remain very soft and will likely remain so until the pandemic ends and consumer confidence improves.
In contrast, consumers sharply stepped up food-at-home purchases in the fourth quarter and retail purchases remain a bright spot for the category and for Lamb Weston. Fry demand in Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also improved since the end of May. Although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway since drive-through options are much more limited. These QSRs act more like full-service restaurants. Like in the U.S., weekly shipments bottomed in April, and they have steadily improved since in but currently remain well below pre-COVID levels.
Fry demand in our other key international markets has been mixed. China's recovery has been solid with our weekly shipments in July approaching pre-COVID levels. Demand in Asia outside of China has been varied, but consumption overall has held up better than in the U.S. and Europe. Consumption in Latin America, including Mexico, held up relatively well in the fourth quarter but began to soften at the end of May.
We have been encouraged by the breadth and the pace of recovery in fry demand. It's been faster than we anticipated when the crisis first arose. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the recovery sustainability. For example, recent actions by California and Texas to reimpose restrictions on restaurants and foodservice outlets as well as New York City's decision to postpone lifting restrictions for on-premise dining illustrate how volatile and fragile the U.S. recovery and demand can be. Because of this uncertainty, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Instead, Rob will detail later, we're providing trends in our shipments that we have observed so far during our fiscal first quarter.
Managing through this crisis has been difficult, and I am proud of how we're executing on a range of priorities and actions to navigate the business in the current environment and position us for success as demand continues to recover. First, we're prioritizing the health and safety of our Lamb Weston team and have adopted enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations. Nonetheless, we've had a number of production employees contract the virus, which has required us to temporarily shut down manufacturing lines to be sanitized. Unfortunately, the possibility of temporarily shutting down lines remains a risk until the virus is under control. We're always seeking ways to improve testing processes that can help us identify affected employees before they show up for work. The safety of our employees has and will continue to be our #1 priority.
Second, we're working to remain a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they manage their supply chains and commercial operations. For example, for our larger chain restaurant customers, we've helped them manage inventory levels in a time of heightened volatility. We've also begun to help customers identify the best fries for delivery and carryout as well as develop limited time offering products that would be available as soon as this fall in the U.S. For independent operators, our direct sales force has been a real asset in allowing us to stay close with customers to identify the appropriate products for simplified menus, creatively broaden our fry offerings and react quickly to customer needs in this volatile market.
Third, we're adapting our manufacturing operations to meet the new demand environment. While necessary, our actions in the resulting disruption has come at a cost during the quarter. For example, we've incurred incremental costs to redirect certain manufacturing lines to make retail products. We've also adjusted production schedules and run times in an effort to spread production across our network and keep factory employees on payroll.
Since the demand environment remains fluid, we'll continue to evaluate further actions to align our manufacturing operations as appropriate. However, meeting customer demand with a workforce that's being affected by the virus creates a difficult scheduling exercise for our manufacturing team, which will continue to make capacity and cost management challenging.
Finally, we've significantly enhanced our liquidity position by securing additional debt financing and taking steps to preserve cash. Based on these actions and our ability to generate cash, we feel confident enough about our liquidity that we fully repaid the borrowings under our credit facility in July.
In summary, we believe that by executing on these priorities and actions, we're positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in fiscal 2021 and to emerge as a stronger company once we're on the other side of this virus. 
Before handing off the call to Rob, let me quickly update you on a couple of items. With respect to this year's potato crop at this point, the crops in our North America growing areas and in Europe are consistent with historical averages. As usual, we'll have more insight on the yield and quality of the crop after the harvest takes place later in the year.
With respect to our customer contract negotiations, we're encouraged by how the discussions have been progressing and have already finalized a handful of the global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts. For those remaining contracts, we'll remain disciplined in taking approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships.
So as you can see in the near term, we're taking the necessary actions across our manufacturing, commercial and support teams to navigate the prices, including, most importantly, prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees and partnering with our customers and suppliers across the globe. 
We're facing an unprecedented challenging and volatile operating environment that will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but we remain confident in our strategies in the long-term health and structure of the category.
Let me turn the call over to Rob."

While t",2413,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemic's effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While the quarter was highly challenging, we've seen improvements in recent months from the lows we saw in April. We believe that we're well positioned to manage through the continuing recovery.
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 16%, including the benefit of an additional week of sales versus the prior year. Excluding that benefit, sales declined 22%. Sales volume was down 17% or 23%, excluding the extra week, as frozen potato demand at restaurants and other foodservice outlets fell sharply in the last 2 months of the quarter following government-imposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic.
The volume decline also reflects inventory destocking by chain restaurant and foodservice customers in April through mid-May as they adjusted to the abrupt drop in near-term demand.
Our weekly shipments towards the end of the quarter more closely mirrored consumer demand trends by channel, but we're still down versus the prior year. Specifically, our weekly shipments to large chain restaurants in the U.S. were about 50% of pre-COVID levels from late March through early April, then improved to around 85% by the end of May as consumers took advantage of QSR drive-throughs.
Our weekly shipments to full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, such as hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues and workplace cafeterias, bottomed at about 20% of pre-COVID levels in mid-April, then improved to approximately 70% by the end of May as some states began to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars.
In contrast, our retail segment's weekly shipments in April through mid-May spiked up around 50% versus prior year as consumers increased food-at-home purchases in response to shelter-in-place orders. Demand remained high as we exited the quarter with weekly shipments growth of about 30%. 
Price/mix increased 1% for the total company, with gains in retail partially offsetting unfavorable mix in our global and foodservice segments. For the year, sales were up 1%, including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding that benefit, sales were down 1%. Gross profit in the quarter declined $139 million. This included about $47 million of cost related to the pandemic's impact on our operations. In the quarter, we elected to keep all of our plants open and continue to pay our employees and, therefore, spread reduced demand across the entire system. This led to all of our plants operating at lower rates, resulting in labor, energy and materials utilization levels that were well off of our standards. Accordingly, this had a significant impact on our margins.
Of the $47 million, about $25 million reflects utilization-related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. These costs and inefficiencies largely consisted of: First, spreading lower volume across our entire manufacturing network there -- including modifying production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing utilization at each facility; second, costs net of any government credits to retain factory labor, including paying them full weekly wages, although hours worked may have been well below that; third, cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities after a factory employee had tested positive for the virus; and finally, incremental cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
To be clear, we expect to incur utilization-related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing operations are impacted by the pandemic, especially with respect to disruptions arising from shutting down and sanitizing facilities, including the cost of shifting production to non-affected locations.
The other $22 million of the $47 million consists of non-utilization-related costs, which largely included nearly $14 million, of which $10 million in the quarter was noncash to terminate certain raw potato purchase obligations related to the 2019 crop, nearly $6 million of incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs, and about $3 million of other costs. We expect over half of these non-utilization-related costs will be nonrecurring.
While these pandemic-related costs had a pronounced impact on our results for the quarter, the remaining $92 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes as well as higher manufacturing costs due to unfavorable mix, other inefficiencies and input cost inflation. We partially offset the decline in gross profit by a $22 million reduction in SG&A expense, which was largely driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and adopting a broad range of cost mitigation efforts. We also reduced advertising and promotional expense by $5 million, primarily related to our retail segment and suspended contributions to our charitable foundation in order to preserve cash. 
Partially offsetting these SG&A reductions were $11 million of expenses related to the pandemic, which largely included expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols; expenses net of government credits to retain certain direct sales employees in our foodservice segment so that we're in a better position to drive growth as demand improves; and expensing more than $3 million of capitalized costs associated with manufacturing expansion projects that were shelved for the time being. We expect to incur some of the pandemic-related SG&A expenses going forward, especially for maintaining enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols.
Equity method earnings swung to a loss of $6 million, down from a positive $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $25 million, of which about $16 million reflects pandemic-related costs and expenses similar to what we incurred in our base business. The remaining $9 million of the decline was largely driven by lower sales, primarily in Europe.
As Tom mentioned, the pandemic's effect on European fry demand was similar to what we saw for full-service restaurants in the U.S., with Lamb Weston/Meijer ship -- weekly shipments bottoming in April at about 35% of prior year levels and recovering to around 60% by the end of May.
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $137 million to $78 million, about $74 million of the decline was due to the pandemic-related costs and expenses that I previously discussed, which included $58 million in our base business and $16 million at our unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales, higher manufacturing costs and lower equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was about $800 million, down 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.01, down from $0.74 last year. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.50, down 22%.
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 18% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2%, largely due to unfavorable customer and product mix, including the impact of lower sales of limited-time offering products. Volume fell 16%. This was due to the sharp drop off in U.S. consumer demand and inventory destocking, with weekly shipments to large chain customers as low as 50% of prior year levels in mid-April and rebounding to about 85% by the end of May.
International sales were mixed. In China, monthly shipments in March recovered to nearly 70% of pre-COVID monthly run rate and recovered to about 80% in May. Monthly shipments to other markets in Asia, Australia and Mexico were 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels through late April, but began to soften by the end of the quarter in certain markets due to inventory destocking.
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less A&P expense, declined $77 million to $34 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for $29 million of the decline, with the remainder primarily driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and chain restaurants outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 44% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% due to unfavorable mix as sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products softened. Price alone was positive, reflecting the pricing actions that we've taken last fall. 
Volume declined 42%, reflecting the severe impact of the shutdown had on full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, including customers destocking inventories in April through early May. By the end of May, our weekly shipment rate had recovered to around 70% of prior year levels.
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined $66 million to $43 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $8 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 56% in the quarter. Volume increased 39%. As we discussed earlier, our weekly shipments have been strong since late March, led by demand for our mainstream branded products, such as Grown In Idaho, as well as for our premium Alexia branded products. Price/mix increased 17%, largely driven by favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $10 million to $31 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by $10 million of pandemic-related costs.
Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Since the pandemic crisis began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by drawing $495 million from our previously undrawn credit facility, entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt was less than $2.2 billion, which is down nearly $140 million from the end of last year, and we had about $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As Tom mentioned, based on these actions and efforts to generate and preserve cash, we feel confident enough in our liquidity that in July, we fully repaid the $495 million that we've drawn on our credit facility.
With respect to cash flow, for the year, we generated about $575 million of cash from operations. That's down more than $100 million versus last year with the decline in earnings. Nonetheless, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $140 million of cash from operations. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. For fiscal 2021, we currently expect capital expenditures of about $140 million as we conduct appropriate plant maintenance and implement phase 1 of our new ERP system. With respect to capital returns, as you may have seen last week, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we continue to suspend our share repurchase program due to the current operating environment.
Now turning to fiscal 2021. As we've noted, we're not providing an outlook for the year because of the unpredictable effect of the pandemic on fry demand in North America and our key international markets. The business environment remains volatile, especially in the U.S., where increases in COVID cases have recently led government authorities in a number of states to reinstate restrictions on restaurant and foodservice outlets. We believe these actions may slow or possibly even reverse some of the recovery in fry demand.
Instead of providing near-term financial targets, we're providing a summary of our shipments during the first 7 weeks or just more than half of our fiscal first quarter. In aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments has improved since the end of May. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large chain restaurant customers, which are predominantly QSRs, have recovered to 85% to 90% of prior year levels during the most recent weeks of the quarter. In our Foodservice segment, which is largely full-service restaurants and other noncommercial customers, weekly shipments during the most recent weeks have been 70% to 75% of prior year levels, including solid recovery in sales of Lamb Weston branded products. Weekly shipments to Retail customers in the most recent weeks have been 5% to 10% more than prior year levels as food-at-home purchases begin to normalize pre-COVID rates. Our growth has been led by our branded products.
In Europe, shipments to date by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture are around 75% of prior year levels. Early in the quarter, weekly shipments were trending at more than 65% and have recovered to around 80% in the most recent weeks as more countries ease restrictions and consumers gain confidence about dining in restaurants. In China, which is included in our Global segment, shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels, with monthly shipments improving from about 80% in May to more than 95% in the most recent weeks. Demand in our other key international markets, which are also included in our Global segment, has softened since the end of the fourth quarter. In Japan, customers have been destocking inventories due to postponement of the Olympics.
In sum, the amount and pace of recovery in fry demand has been better than what we had anticipated when the crisis first arose. QSRs in the U.S. have bounced back faster than we expected, while full-service restaurants have also recovered somewhat faster due to states easing restrictions. Demand in Europe and China has progressed largely in line with our expectations, while other international markets are a bit softer. However, to be clear, we believe that this improvement remains fragile as COVID cases continue to rise in the U.S. and in Latin America. We are currently seeing evidence of orders slowing after some states recently placed restrictions for on-premise dining at restaurants. We expect that this high degree of uncertainty will likely continue until the pandemic has ended and consumer confidence has been restored.
With respect to costs, as Tom discussed, we've taken a range of actions to reduce our cost profile. We'd expect to continue to incur incremental costs and expenses, resulting from the pandemic's impact on our operations. For example, these include expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols throughout the company; cost to modify production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing plant and labor utilization; cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities when necessary; and cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
So as you can see, it was a challenging quarter where we've executed well and took the necessary actions to maintain through a potentially volatile period going forward.
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And what's manageable today is different tomorrow, it's different yesterday. But we do have a lens of future demand based on orders in the system. Now it's narrowed down a lot from what it used to be just because of the uncertainty in the channels. So it's -- again, it's ensuring as best we can with the disruptions we're having in our manufacturing plants, making sure we've got taking care of the key customers. Certainly, we're having some challenges with the plant shut down, but the demand signal -- we look at a lot of data, just like every other company, the demand signal is the key that's going to drive the near term going forward. Certainly, when we have some of these contracts done and behind us, that's helpful, but that's not necessarily an indicator on the demand forecast because the historical demand that we would have with these big customers has completely changed. So we're hand to mouth right now on what they're seeing in their store and store traffic.
As you can imagine, with the things that are going on in the environment, in the U.S. specifically of some of our bigger markets that are -- have more spikes in cases and more restrictions, the signal is mixed. So -- but the encouraging thing to all this is over the past 6, 8 weeks, as Rob alluded to, the things we look at, it's hanging in there pretty well across all of our channels. But the whole key to this is demand signal. And we look at a lot of different data. We certainly have a lens on what our forward orders look like. But the outlook period is a lot shorter than what it used to be, but we're monitoring it closely."

And I'm just trying to really think about those incremental kind of production costs that you laid out in the press release and how much of that was more onetime? How much of that is more recurring as long as you've got this kind of the COVID issues playing? And maybe finally, how would you frame how to think about the decremental gross margins as your volumes are certainly still down year-on-year, just over the next the 3 months to 12 months?"

As I walk through those, I broke it into the $25 million that's utilization-related costs and then the $22 million that's not utilization related costs. And if you look at that $22 million, $14 million of that was related to the 20 -- or the 2019 crop write-off. And so there may be some tweaking and true-up here in Q1 as we finalize those discussions with the growers. But not likely that, that's going to recur in our minds. Transportation, warehousing, inefficiencies may have some recurrence of some of that, but hopefully, we would -- the steps we've taken to improve and the additional volume pushing through that we're getting should help that as well. And then you go to the utilization costs and really, that's the tough -- that's the one that's really tough to forecast because that's largely driven by really jerking around production schedules. So think about it as we've got a production schedule in a plant to go run, couple of people show up after a long weekend with COVID, and we don't have enough people, and we don't have the assurance to continue to run that line and keep people safe and healthy. And so we then take a step to shut that down. I have no idea how to forecast that. And so that's one that you look at that $25 million and it's hard for me to get my head around that we're not going to continue to incur some of those costs. And I'll tell you, in Q1, we have had some additional hits and some shutdowns and restarts and sanitizations of the lines. So that's the way I think about it. I know it's not perfect information, but I think that's reality of what we're dealing with here."

Just to the extent that we're in a recession, could you remind us first what that was like in '08 and '09? And more specifically, how aggressive the maybe the behavior was in terms of competitors going after pieces of business? And do you anticipate that, that could be sort of a factor, again, not so much in this current round of contracts, but as we're looking out into '22 or '23, anything that you're seeing that would make you think that it just could become more competitive in that regard?"

In terms of those costs, again, I think that as you look through those, I broke them down into the $25 million related to utilization and the $22 million that was not related to utilization. Of that $22 million, again, a big chunk of that was related to raw write-off related to 2019 crop and settling those contracts. And so I would not expect anything material out of that to recur or extend other than there may be some minor true-ups here that we clean up in Q1, but it's going to be much smaller than what we saw previously. And then I said there were some capital write-offs that we had in the quarter that don't anticipate those will recur. And then transportation warehousing, I said that expect those to improve versus what we saw in Q4 may still have some, but they'll be better.
On the utilization costs, the $25 million of utilization costs, as Tom and I talked through, it's really tough to predict and to forecast what's going to happen because those are largely driven by a couple of things: One, what's happening on the demand signal; and two, what's happening in terms of employee health as they show up for work. We can keep them safe at work and keep them healthy at work. But outside of work as they circulate in the community, they may get sick, and so we may have unexpected shutdowns of plants. And so that's what's driving that $25 million is that utilization that is tied to both of those issues. So that's the one that I would expect will have some recurrence. Hopefully, we're getting better and smarter at managing those costs. But that's the one where there's a risk, I think."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before getting into our performance in the quarter, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their commitment to support our communities, our customers and our consumers during these trying times, while keeping themselves and their colleagues safe. We should be proud of doing our part to help feed people around the world. It's their commitment and spirit of teamwork that makes me so honored to be part of this great company.
Now let me turn to the performance. The final months of fiscal 2020 were some of the most challenging in Lamb Weston's history. After starting to realize the impact of government efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus in China on our local operations in February, we saw a more severe effect on our overall business beginning in late March as governments in the U.S. and Europe took actions to try to slow the spread of the virus. These government restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice businesses abruptly and significantly reduced restaurant traffic and the demand for fries. In addition, the initial drop in demand was so steep and quick that customers needed to adjust inventory levels, which further reduced our shipments. As a result, our sales and earnings fell in the fourth quarter.
Starting in May, U.S. demand for fries began to recover, and that improvement has continued through mid-July. The recovery has been led by quick-service restaurants as consumers leveraged drive-through options. By the end of June, QSR traffic rebounded significantly. As expected, full-service restaurants were affected much more severely than QSRs. They adapted by increasing carryout and delivery options. And starting in late May, consumer traffic began to increase as certain state governments gradually eased restrictions to allow for more on-premise dining. However, while steadily improving, our shipments to this channel currently remain well below prior year levels.
Fry demand by our noncommercial customers, such as hotels, schools, universities and sporting venues, was hit hard as traffic at these outlets suffered. Our shipments to these customers remain very soft and will likely remain so until the pandemic ends and consumer confidence improves.
In contrast, consumers sharply stepped up food-at-home purchases in the fourth quarter and retail purchases remain a bright spot for the category and for Lamb Weston. Fry demand in Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also improved since the end of May. Although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway since drive-through options are much more limited. These QSRs act more like full-service restaurants. Like in the U.S., weekly shipments bottomed in April, and they have steadily improved since in but currently remain well below pre-COVID levels.
Fry demand in our other key international markets has been mixed. China's recovery has been solid with our weekly shipments in July approaching pre-COVID levels. Demand in Asia outside of China has been varied, but consumption overall has held up better than in the U.S. and Europe. Consumption in Latin America, including Mexico, held up relatively well in the fourth quarter but began to soften at the end of May.
We have been encouraged by the breadth and the pace of recovery in fry demand. It's been faster than we anticipated when the crisis first arose. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the recovery sustainability. For example, recent actions by California and Texas to reimpose restrictions on restaurants and foodservice outlets as well as New York City's decision to postpone lifting restrictions for on-premise dining illustrate how volatile and fragile the U.S. recovery and demand can be. Because of this uncertainty, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Instead, Rob will detail later, we're providing trends in our shipments that we have observed so far during our fiscal first quarter.
Managing through this crisis has been difficult, and I am proud of how we're executing on a range of priorities and actions to navigate the business in the current environment and position us for success as demand continues to recover. First, we're prioritizing the health and safety of our Lamb Weston team and have adopted enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations. Nonetheless, we've had a number of production employees contract the virus, which has required us to temporarily shut down manufacturing lines to be sanitized. Unfortunately, the possibility of temporarily shutting down lines remains a risk until the virus is under control. We're always seeking ways to improve testing processes that can help us identify affected employees before they show up for work. The safety of our employees has and will continue to be our #1 priority.
Second, we're working to remain a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they manage their supply chains and commercial operations. For example, for our larger chain restaurant customers, we've helped them manage inventory levels in a time of heightened volatility. We've also begun to help customers identify the best fries for delivery and carryout as well as develop limited-time offering products that would be available as soon as this fall in the U.S. For independent operators, our direct sales force has been a real asset in allowing us to stay close with customers to identify the appropriate products for simplified menus, creatively broaden our fry offerings and react quickly to customer needs in this volatile market.
Third, we're adapting our manufacturing operations to meet the new demand environment. While necessary, our actions in the resulting disruption has come at a cost during the quarter. For example, we've incurred incremental costs to redirect certain manufacturing lines to make retail products. We've also adjusted production schedules and run times in an effort to spread production across our network and keep factory employees on payroll.
Since the demand environment remains fluid, we'll continue to evaluate further actions to align our manufacturing operations as appropriate. However, meeting customer demand with a workforce that's being affected by the virus creates a difficult scheduling exercise for our manufacturing team, which will continue to make capacity and cost management challenging.
Finally, we've significantly enhanced our liquidity position by securing additional debt financing and taking steps to preserve cash. Based on these actions and our ability to generate cash, we feel confident enough about our liquidity that we fully repaid the borrowings under our credit facility in July.
In summary, we believe that by executing on these priorities and actions, we're positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in fiscal 2021 and to emerge as a stronger company once we're on the other side of this virus. 
Before handing off the call to Rob, let me quickly update you on a couple of items. With respect to this year's potato crop at this point, the crops in our North America growing areas and in Europe are consistent with historical averages. As usual, we'll have more insight on the yield and quality of the crop after the harvest takes place later in the year.
With respect to our customer contract negotiations, we're encouraged by how the discussions have been progressing and have already finalized a handful of the global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts. For those remaining contracts, we'll remain disciplined in taking approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships.
So as you can see in the near term, we're taking the necessary actions across our manufacturing, commercial and support teams to navigate the prices, including, most importantly, prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees and partnering with our customers and suppliers across the globe. 
We're facing an unprecedented challenging and volatile operating environment that will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but we remain confident in our strategies in the long-term health and structure of the category.
Let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,675439737,2078171,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemic's effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While t",2413,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemic's effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While the quarter was highly challenging, we've seen improvements in recent months from the lows we saw in April. We believe that we're well positioned to manage through the continuing recovery.
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 16%, including the benefit of an additional week of sales versus the prior year. Excluding that benefit, sales declined 22%. Sales volume was down 17% or 23%, excluding the extra week, as frozen potato demand at restaurants and other foodservice outlets fell sharply in the last 2 months of the quarter following government-imposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic.
The volume decline also reflects inventory destocking by chain restaurant and foodservice customers in April through mid-May as they adjusted to the abrupt drop in near-term demand.
Our weekly shipments towards the end of the quarter more closely mirrored consumer demand trends by channel, but we're still down versus the prior year. Specifically, our weekly shipments to large chain restaurants in the U.S. were about 50% of pre-COVID levels from late March through early April, then improved to around 85% by the end of May as consumers took advantage of QSR drive-throughs.
Our weekly shipments to full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, such as hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues and workplace cafeterias, bottomed at about 20% of pre-COVID levels in mid-April, then improved to approximately 70% by the end of May as some states began to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars.
In contrast, our retail segment's weekly shipments in April through mid-May spiked up around 50% versus prior year as consumers increased food-at-home purchases in response to shelter-in-place orders. Demand remained high as we exited the quarter with weekly shipments growth of about 30%. 
Price/mix increased 1% for the total company, with gains in retail partially offsetting unfavorable mix in our global and foodservice segments. For the year, sales were up 1%, including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding that benefit, sales were down 1%. Gross profit in the quarter declined $139 million. This included about $47 million of cost related to the pandemic's impact on our operations. In the quarter, we elected to keep all of our plants open and continue to pay our employees and, therefore, spread reduced demand across the entire system. This led to all of our plants operating at lower rates, resulting in labor, energy and materials utilization levels that were well off of our standards. Accordingly, this had a significant impact on our margins.
Of the $47 million, about $25 million reflects utilization-related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. These costs and inefficiencies largely consisted of: First, spreading lower volume across our entire manufacturing network there -- including modifying production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing utilization at each facility; second, costs net of any government credits to retain factory labor, including paying them full weekly wages, although hours worked may have been well below that; third, cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities after a factory employee had tested positive for the virus; and finally, incremental cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
To be clear, we expect to incur utilization-related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing operations are impacted by the pandemic, especially with respect to disruptions arising from shutting down and sanitizing facilities, including the cost of shifting production to non-affected locations.
The other $22 million of the $47 million consists of non-utilization-related costs, which largely included nearly $14 million, of which $10 million in the quarter was noncash to terminate certain raw potato purchase obligations related to the 2019 crop, nearly $6 million of incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs, and about $3 million of other costs. We expect over half of these non-utilization-related costs will be nonrecurring.
While these pandemic-related costs had a pronounced impact on our results for the quarter, the remaining $92 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes as well as higher manufacturing costs due to unfavorable mix, other inefficiencies and input cost inflation. We partially offset the decline in gross profit by a $22 million reduction in SG&A expense, which was largely driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and adopting a broad range of cost mitigation efforts. We also reduced advertising and promotional expense by $5 million, primarily related to our retail segment and suspended contributions to our charitable foundation in order to preserve cash. 
Partially offsetting these SG&A reductions were $11 million of expenses related to the pandemic, which largely included expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols; expenses net of government credits to retain certain direct sales employees in our foodservice segment so that we're in a better position to drive growth as demand improves; and expensing more than $3 million of capitalized costs associated with manufacturing expansion projects that were shelved for the time being. We expect to incur some of the pandemic-related SG&A expenses going forward, especially for maintaining enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols.
Equity method earnings swung to a loss of $6 million, down from a positive $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $25 million, of which about $16 million reflects pandemic-related costs and expenses similar to what we incurred in our base business. The remaining $9 million of the decline was largely driven by lower sales, primarily in Europe.
As Tom mentioned, the pandemic's effect on European fry demand was similar to what we saw for full-service restaurants in the U.S., with Lamb Weston/Meijer ship -- weekly shipments bottoming in April at about 35% of prior year levels and recovering to around 60% by the end of May.
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $137 million to $78 million, about $74 million of the decline was due to the pandemic-related costs and expenses that I previously discussed, which included $58 million in our base business and $16 million at our unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales, higher manufacturing costs and lower equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was about $800 million, down 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.01, down from $0.74 last year. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.50, down 22%.
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 18% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2%, largely due to unfavorable customer and product mix, including the impact of lower sales of limited-time offering products. Volume fell 16%. This was due to the sharp drop off in U.S. consumer demand and inventory destocking, with weekly shipments to large chain customers as low as 50% of prior year levels in mid-April and rebounding to about 85% by the end of May.
International sales were mixed. In China, monthly shipments in March recovered to nearly 70% of pre-COVID monthly run rate and recovered to about 80% in May. Monthly shipments to other markets in Asia, Australia and Mexico were 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels through late April, but began to soften by the end of the quarter in certain markets due to inventory destocking.
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less A&P expense, declined $77 million to $34 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for $29 million of the decline, with the remainder primarily driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and chain restaurants outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 44% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% due to unfavorable mix as sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products softened. Price alone was positive, reflecting the pricing actions that we've taken last fall. 
Volume declined 42%, reflecting the severe impact of the shutdown had on full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, including customers destocking inventories in April through early May. By the end of May, our weekly shipment rate had recovered to around 70% of prior year levels.
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined $66 million to $43 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $8 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 56% in the quarter. Volume increased 39%. As we discussed earlier, our weekly shipments have been strong since late March, led by demand for our mainstream branded products, such as Grown In Idaho, as well as for our premium Alexia branded products. Price/mix increased 17%, largely driven by favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $10 million to $31 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by $10 million of pandemic-related costs.
Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Since the pandemic crisis began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by drawing $495 million from our previously undrawn credit facility, entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt was less than $2.2 billion, which is down nearly $140 million from the end of last year, and we had about $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As Tom mentioned, based on these actions and efforts to generate and preserve cash, we feel confident enough in our liquidity that in July, we fully repaid the $495 million that we've drawn on our credit facility.
With respect to cash flow, for the year, we generated about $575 million of cash from operations. That's down more than $100 million versus last year with the decline in earnings. Nonetheless, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $140 million of cash from operations. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. For fiscal 2021, we currently expect capital expenditures of about $140 million as we conduct appropriate plant maintenance and implement phase 1 of our new ERP system. With respect to capital returns, as you may have seen last week, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we continue to suspend our share repurchase program due to the current operating environment.
Now turning to fiscal 2021. As we've noted, we're not providing an outlook for the year because of the unpredictable effect of the pandemic on fry demand in North America and our key international markets. The business environment remains volatile, especially in the U.S., where increases in COVID cases have recently led government authorities in a number of states to reinstate restrictions on restaurant and foodservice outlets. We believe these actions may slow or possibly even reverse some of the recovery in fry demand.
Instead of providing near-term financial targets, we're providing a summary of our shipments during the first 7 weeks or just more than half of our fiscal first quarter. In aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments has improved since the end of May. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large chain restaurant customers, which are predominantly QSRs, have recovered to 85% to 90% of prior year levels during the most recent weeks of the quarter. In our Foodservice segment, which is largely full-service restaurants and other noncommercial customers, weekly shipments during the most recent weeks have been 70% to 75% of prior year levels, including solid recovery in sales of Lamb Weston branded products. Weekly shipments to Retail customers in the most recent weeks have been 5% to 10% more than prior year levels as food-at-home purchases begin to normalize pre-COVID rates. Our growth has been led by our branded products.
In Europe, shipments to date by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture are around 75% of prior year levels. Early in the quarter, weekly shipments were trending at more than 65% and have recovered to around 80% in the most recent weeks as more countries ease restrictions and consumers gain confidence about dining in restaurants. In China, which is included in our Global segment, shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels, with monthly shipments improving from about 80% in May to more than 95% in the most recent weeks. Demand in our other key international markets, which are also included in our Global segment, has softened since the end of the fourth quarter. In Japan, customers have been destocking inventories due to postponement of the Olympics.
In sum, the amount and pace of recovery in fry demand has been better than what we had anticipated when the crisis first arose. QSRs in the U.S. have bounced back faster than we expected, while full-service restaurants have also recovered somewhat faster due to states easing restrictions. Demand in Europe and China has progressed largely in line with our expectations, while other international markets are a bit softer. However, to be clear, we believe that this improvement remains fragile as COVID cases continue to rise in the U.S. and in Latin America. We are currently seeing evidence of orders slowing after some states recently placed restrictions for on-premise dining at restaurants. We expect that this high degree of uncertainty will likely continue until the pandemic has ended and consumer confidence has been restored.
With respect to costs, as Tom discussed, we've taken a range of actions to reduce our cost profile. We'd expect to continue to incur incremental costs and expenses, resulting from the pandemic's impact on our operations. For example, these include expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols throughout the company; cost to modify production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing plant and labor utilization; cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities when necessary; and cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
So as you can see, it was a challenging quarter where we've executed well and took the necessary actions to maintain through a potentially volatile period going forward.
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

We believe that the tough decisions we made and the actions we've taken have us well positioned for fiscal 2021 and beyond.
The recovery in demand these past few months has been encouraging, with solid improvements in most of our channels, especially at QSRs. While we expect there will be some bumps on the road to recovery, we'll continue to overcome them as the year progresses. Our long-term view remains the same, and we remain confident in our strategies, our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and create value for all our stakeholders.

And what's manageable today is different tomorrow, it's different yesterday. But we do have a lens of future demand based on orders in the system. Now it's narrowed down a lot from what it used to be just because of the uncertainty in the channels. So it's -- again, it's ensuring as best we can with the disruptions we're having in our manufacturing plants, making sure we've got taking care of the key customers. Certainly, we're having some challenges with the plant shut down, but the demand signal -- we look at a lot of data, just like every other company, the demand signal is the key that's going to drive the near term going forward. Certainly, when we have some of these contracts done and behind us, that's helpful, but that's not necessarily an indicator on the demand forecast because the historical demand that we would have with these big customers has completely changed. So we're hand to mouth right now on what they're seeing in their store and store traffic.
As you can imagine, with the things that are going on in the environment, in the U.S. specifically of some of our bigger markets that are -- have more spikes in cases and more restrictions, the signal is mixed. So -- but the encouraging thing to all this is over the past 6, 8 weeks, as Rob alluded to, the things we look at, it's hanging in there pretty well across all of our channels. But the whole key to this is demand signal. And we look at a lot of different data. We certainly have a lens on what our forward orders look like. But the outlook period is a lot shorter than what it used to be, but we're monitoring it closely."

And I'm just trying to really think about those incremental kind of production costs that you laid out in the press release and how much of that was more onetime? How much of that is more recurring as long as you've got this kind of the COVID issues playing? And maybe finally, how would you frame how to think about the decremental gross margins as your volumes are certainly still down year-on-year, just over the next the 3 months to 12 months?"

As I walk through those, I broke it into the $25 million that's utilization-related costs and then the $22 million that's not utilization related costs. And if you look at that $22 million, $14 million of that was related to the 20 -- or the 2019 crop write-off. And so there may be some tweaking and true-up here in Q1 as we finalize those discussions with the growers. But not likely that, that's going to recur in our minds. Transportation, warehousing, inefficiencies may have some recurrence of some of that, but hopefully, we would -- the steps we've taken to improve and the additional volume pushing through that we're getting should help that as well. And then you go to the utilization costs and really, that's the tough -- that's the one that's really tough to forecast because that's largely driven by really jerking around production schedules. So think about it as we've got a production schedule in a plant to go run, couple of people show up after a long weekend with COVID, and we don't have enough people, and we don't have the assurance to continue to run that line and keep people safe and healthy. And so we then take a step to shut that down. I have no idea how to forecast that. And so that's one that you look at that $25 million and it's hard for me to get my head around that we're not going to continue to incur some of those costs. And I'll tell you, in Q1, we have had some additional hits and some shutdowns and restarts and sanitizations of the lines. So that's the way I think about it. I know it's not perfect information, but I think that's reality of what we're dealing with here."

But kind of overall, do you feel like -- all things considered, we're actually not in a bad spot. We think that maybe, hopefully, the worst is behind us. And what we saw in Q4, hopefully, right, would be the worst. And now we can kind of work our way back because demand has been created, the harvest seems okay, contract lowers, supply orders actually came in decently. And basically, our forecasting might actually prove out to be okay, and we might actually be in a pretty good spot once we get to the end of the year. I mean, that's the hope.

And so we're currently incurring some training costs related to that. But that's the only element of SG&A that, I would say, would be anything that's outside the norm, and that's going to be in the sub-$10 million.

And as the year plays out, Chris, we get 6 to 8 months down the road and we start talking about 2021 crop. We can make some adjustments with that crop -- early crop going forward, if the demand returns to normalized levels, so to speak. So I feel good about how we're positioned.

In terms of those costs, again, I think that as you look through those, I broke them down into the $25 million related to utilization and the $22 million that was not related to utilization. Of that $22 million, again, a big chunk of that was related to raw write-off related to 2019 crop and settling those contracts. And so I would not expect anything material out of that to recur or extend other than there may be some minor true-ups here that we clean up in Q1, but it's going to be much smaller than what we saw previously. And then I said there were some capital write-offs that we had in the quarter that don't anticipate those will recur. And then transportation warehousing, I said that expect those to improve versus what we saw in Q4 may still have some, but they'll be better.
On the utilization costs, the $25 million of utilization costs, as Tom and I talked through, it's really tough to predict and to forecast what's going to happen because those are largely driven by a couple of things: One, what's happening on the demand signal; and two, what's happening in terms of employee health as they show up for work. We can keep them safe at work and keep them healthy at work. But outside of work as they circulate in the community, they may get sick, and so we may have unexpected shutdowns of plants. And so that's what's driving that $25 million is that utilization that is tied to both of those issues. So that's the one that I would expect will have some recurrence. Hopefully, we're getting better and smarter at managing those costs. But that's the one where there's a risk, I think."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Before getting into our performance in the quarter, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their commitment to support our communities, our customers and our consumers during these trying times, while keeping themselves and their colleagues safe. We should be proud of doing our part to help feed people around the world. It's their commitment and spirit of teamwork that makes me so honored to be part of this great company.
Now let me turn to the performance. The final months of fiscal 2020 were some of the most challenging in Lamb Weston's history. After starting to realize the impact of government efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus in China on our local operations in February, we saw a more severe effect on our overall business beginning in late March as governments in the U.S. and Europe took actions to try to slow the spread of the virus. These government restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice businesses abruptly and significantly reduced restaurant traffic and the demand for fries. In addition, the initial drop in demand was so steep and quick that customers needed to adjust inventory levels, which further reduced our shipments. As a result, our sales and earnings fell in the fourth quarter.
Starting in May, U.S. demand for fries began to recover, and that improvement has continued through mid-July. The recovery has been led by quick-service restaurants as consumers leveraged drive-through options. By the end of June, QSR traffic rebounded significantly. As expected, full-service restaurants were affected much more severely than QSRs. They adapted by increasing carryout and delivery options. And starting in late May, consumer traffic began to increase as certain state governments gradually eased restrictions to allow for more on-premise dining. However, while steadily improving, our shipments to this channel currently remain well below prior year levels.
Fry demand by our noncommercial customers, such as hotels, schools, universities and sporting venues, was hit hard as traffic at these outlets suffered. Our shipments to these customers remain very soft and will likely remain so until the pandemic ends and consumer confidence improves.
In contrast, consumers sharply stepped up food-at-home purchases in the fourth quarter and retail purchases remain a bright spot for the category and for Lamb Weston. Fry demand in Europe, which is served through our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also improved since the end of May. Although a high proportion of our sales are to QSRs, most of the consumption is dine-in or takeaway since drive-through options are much more limited. These QSRs act more like full-service restaurants. Like in the U.S., weekly shipments bottomed in April, and they have steadily improved since in but currently remain well below pre-COVID levels.
Fry demand in our other key international markets has been mixed. China's recovery has been solid with our weekly shipments in July approaching pre-COVID levels. Demand in Asia outside of China has been varied, but consumption overall has held up better than in the U.S. and Europe. Consumption in Latin America, including Mexico, held up relatively well in the fourth quarter but began to soften at the end of May.
We have been encouraged by the breadth and the pace of recovery in fry demand. It's been faster than we anticipated when the crisis first arose. However, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the recovery sustainability. For example, recent actions by California and Texas to reimpose restrictions on restaurants and foodservice outlets as well as New York City's decision to postpone lifting restrictions for on-premise dining illustrate how volatile and fragile the U.S. recovery and demand can be. Because of this uncertainty, we are not providing a financial outlook for fiscal 2021. Instead, Rob will detail later, we're providing trends in our shipments that we have observed so far during our fiscal first quarter.
Managing through this crisis has been difficult, and I am proud of how we're executing on a range of priorities and actions to navigate the business in the current environment and position us for success as demand continues to recover. First, we're prioritizing the health and safety of our Lamb Weston team and have adopted enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations. Nonetheless, we've had a number of production employees contract the virus, which has required us to temporarily shut down manufacturing lines to be sanitized. Unfortunately, the possibility of temporarily shutting down lines remains a risk until the virus is under control. We're always seeking ways to improve testing processes that can help us identify affected employees before they show up for work. The safety of our employees has and will continue to be our #1 priority.
Second, we're working to remain a trusted and valued business partner for our customers as they manage their supply chains and commercial operations. For example, for our larger chain restaurant customers, we've helped them manage inventory levels in a time of heightened volatility. We've also begun to help customers identify the best fries for delivery and carryout as well as develop limited-time offering products that would be available as soon as this fall in the U.S. For independent operators, our direct sales force has been a real asset in allowing us to stay close with customers to identify the appropriate products for simplified menus, creatively broaden our fry offerings and react quickly to customer needs in this volatile market.
Third, we're adapting our manufacturing operations to meet the new demand environment. While necessary, our actions in the resulting disruption has come at a cost during the quarter. For example, we've incurred incremental costs to redirect certain manufacturing lines to make retail products. We've also adjusted production schedules and run times in an effort to spread production across our network and keep factory employees on payroll.
Since the demand environment remains fluid, we'll continue to evaluate further actions to align our manufacturing operations as appropriate. However, meeting customer demand with a workforce that's being affected by the virus creates a difficult scheduling exercise for our manufacturing team, which will continue to make capacity and cost management challenging.
Finally, we've significantly enhanced our liquidity position by securing additional debt financing and taking steps to preserve cash. Based on these actions and our ability to generate cash, we feel confident enough about our liquidity that we fully repaid the borrowings under our credit facility in July.
In summary, we believe that by executing on these priorities and actions, we're positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in fiscal 2021 and to emerge as a stronger company once we're on the other side of this virus. 
Before handing off the call to Rob, let me quickly update you on a couple of items. With respect to this year's potato crop at this point, the crops in our North America growing areas and in Europe are consistent with historical averages. As usual, we'll have more insight on the yield and quality of the crop after the harvest takes place later in the year.
With respect to our customer contract negotiations, we're encouraged by how the discussions have been progressing and have already finalized a handful of the global and regional restaurant chain customer contracts. For those remaining contracts, we'll remain disciplined in taking approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships.
So as you can see in the near term, we're taking the necessary actions across our manufacturing, commercial and support teams to navigate the prices, including, most importantly, prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees and partnering with our customers and suppliers across the globe. 
We're facing an unprecedented challenging and volatile operating environment that will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but we remain confident in our strategies in the long-term health and structure of the category.

While t",2413,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our fourth quarter results reflect the pandemic's effect on frozen potato demand as well as the impact on our cost structure as we manage through the crisis and position ourselves for fiscal 2021. While the quarter was highly challenging, we've seen improvements in recent months from the lows we saw in April. We believe that we're well positioned to manage through the continuing recovery.
Specifically in the quarter, net sales declined 16%, including the benefit of an additional week of sales versus the prior year. Excluding that benefit, sales declined 22%. Sales volume was down 17% or 23%, excluding the extra week, as frozen potato demand at restaurants and other foodservice outlets fell sharply in the last 2 months of the quarter following government-imposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stay-at-home orders related to the pandemic.
The volume decline also reflects inventory destocking by chain restaurant and foodservice customers in April through mid-May as they adjusted to the abrupt drop in near-term demand.
Our weekly shipments towards the end of the quarter more closely mirrored consumer demand trends by channel, but we're still down versus the prior year. Specifically, our weekly shipments to large chain restaurants in the U.S. were about 50% of pre-COVID levels from late March through early April, then improved to around 85% by the end of May as consumers took advantage of QSR drive-throughs.
Our weekly shipments to full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, such as hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues and workplace cafeterias, bottomed at about 20% of pre-COVID levels in mid-April, then improved to approximately 70% by the end of May as some states began to ease restrictions on restaurants and bars.
In contrast, our retail segment's weekly shipments in April through mid-May spiked up around 50% versus prior year as consumers increased food-at-home purchases in response to shelter-in-place orders. Demand remained high as we exited the quarter with weekly shipments growth of about 30%. 
Price/mix increased 1% for the total company, with gains in retail partially offsetting unfavorable mix in our global and foodservice segments. For the year, sales were up 1%, including the benefit of the 53rd week. Excluding that benefit, sales were down 1%. Gross profit in the quarter declined $139 million. This included about $47 million of cost related to the pandemic's impact on our operations. In the quarter, we elected to keep all of our plants open and continue to pay our employees and, therefore, spread reduced demand across the entire system. This led to all of our plants operating at lower rates, resulting in labor, energy and materials utilization levels that were well off of our standards. Accordingly, this had a significant impact on our margins.
Of the $47 million, about $25 million reflects utilization-related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. These costs and inefficiencies largely consisted of: First, spreading lower volume across our entire manufacturing network there -- including modifying production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing utilization at each facility; second, costs net of any government credits to retain factory labor, including paying them full weekly wages, although hours worked may have been well below that; third, cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities after a factory employee had tested positive for the virus; and finally, incremental cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
To be clear, we expect to incur utilization-related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing operations are impacted by the pandemic, especially with respect to disruptions arising from shutting down and sanitizing facilities, including the cost of shifting production to non-affected locations.
The other $22 million of the $47 million consists of non-utilization-related costs, which largely included nearly $14 million, of which $10 million in the quarter was noncash to terminate certain raw potato purchase obligations related to the 2019 crop, nearly $6 million of incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs, and about $3 million of other costs. We expect over half of these non-utilization-related costs will be nonrecurring.
While these pandemic-related costs had a pronounced impact on our results for the quarter, the remaining $92 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes as well as higher manufacturing costs due to unfavorable mix, other inefficiencies and input cost inflation. We partially offset the decline in gross profit by a $22 million reduction in SG&A expense, which was largely driven by lower incentive compensation accruals and adopting a broad range of cost mitigation efforts. We also reduced advertising and promotional expense by $5 million, primarily related to our retail segment and suspended contributions to our charitable foundation in order to preserve cash. 
Partially offsetting these SG&A reductions were $11 million of expenses related to the pandemic, which largely included expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols; expenses net of government credits to retain certain direct sales employees in our foodservice segment so that we're in a better position to drive growth as demand improves; and expensing more than $3 million of capitalized costs associated with manufacturing expansion projects that were shelved for the time being. We expect to incur some of the pandemic-related SG&A expenses going forward, especially for maintaining enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols.
Equity method earnings swung to a loss of $6 million, down from a positive $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $25 million, of which about $16 million reflects pandemic-related costs and expenses similar to what we incurred in our base business. The remaining $9 million of the decline was largely driven by lower sales, primarily in Europe.
As Tom mentioned, the pandemic's effect on European fry demand was similar to what we saw for full-service restaurants in the U.S., with Lamb Weston/Meijer ship -- weekly shipments bottoming in April at about 35% of prior year levels and recovering to around 60% by the end of May.
Adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, declined $137 million to $78 million, about $74 million of the decline was due to the pandemic-related costs and expenses that I previously discussed, which included $58 million in our base business and $16 million at our unconsolidated joint ventures. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales, higher manufacturing costs and lower equity method earnings. For the year, adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, was about $800 million, down 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was a loss of $0.01, down from $0.74 last year. For the year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.50, down 22%.
Moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based chains as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 18% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2%, largely due to unfavorable customer and product mix, including the impact of lower sales of limited-time offering products. Volume fell 16%. This was due to the sharp drop off in U.S. consumer demand and inventory destocking, with weekly shipments to large chain customers as low as 50% of prior year levels in mid-April and rebounding to about 85% by the end of May.
International sales were mixed. In China, monthly shipments in March recovered to nearly 70% of pre-COVID monthly run rate and recovered to about 80% in May. Monthly shipments to other markets in Asia, Australia and Mexico were 70% to 80% of pre-COVID levels through late April, but began to soften by the end of the quarter in certain markets due to inventory destocking.
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit, less A&P expense, declined $77 million to $34 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for $29 million of the decline, with the remainder primarily driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and chain restaurants outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 44% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 2% due to unfavorable mix as sales of Lamb Weston branded and premium products softened. Price alone was positive, reflecting the pricing actions that we've taken last fall. 
Volume declined 42%, reflecting the severe impact of the shutdown had on full-service restaurants and noncommercial outlets, including customers destocking inventories in April through early May. By the end of May, our weekly shipment rate had recovered to around 70% of prior year levels.
Foodservice's product contribution margin declined $66 million to $43 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $8 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, unfavorable mix and higher manufacturing costs.
Sales in our Retail segment increased 56% in the quarter. Volume increased 39%. As we discussed earlier, our weekly shipments have been strong since late March, led by demand for our mainstream branded products, such as Grown In Idaho, as well as for our premium Alexia branded products. Price/mix increased 17%, largely driven by favorable mix and pricing actions. Retail's product contribution margin increased $10 million to $31 million. This was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense and was partially offset by $10 million of pandemic-related costs.
Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Since the pandemic crisis began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by drawing $495 million from our previously undrawn credit facility, entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. At the end of the quarter, our net debt was less than $2.2 billion, which is down nearly $140 million from the end of last year, and we had about $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As Tom mentioned, based on these actions and efforts to generate and preserve cash, we feel confident enough in our liquidity that in July, we fully repaid the $495 million that we've drawn on our credit facility.
With respect to cash flow, for the year, we generated about $575 million of cash from operations. That's down more than $100 million versus last year with the decline in earnings. Nonetheless, in the fourth quarter, we generated about $140 million of cash from operations. Our top priorities in deploying that cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. For fiscal 2021, we currently expect capital expenditures of about $140 million as we conduct appropriate plant maintenance and implement phase 1 of our new ERP system. With respect to capital returns, as you may have seen last week, we declared our regular quarterly dividend. However, we continue to suspend our share repurchase program due to the current operating environment.
Now turning to fiscal 2021. As we've noted, we're not providing an outlook for the year because of the unpredictable effect of the pandemic on fry demand in North America and our key international markets. The business environment remains volatile, especially in the U.S., where increases in COVID cases have recently led government authorities in a number of states to reinstate restrictions on restaurant and foodservice outlets. We believe these actions may slow or possibly even reverse some of the recovery in fry demand.
Instead of providing near-term financial targets, we're providing a summary of our shipments during the first 7 weeks or just more than half of our fiscal first quarter. In aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments has improved since the end of May. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels. In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large chain restaurant customers, which are predominantly QSRs, have recovered to 85% to 90% of prior year levels during the most recent weeks of the quarter. In our Foodservice segment, which is largely full-service restaurants and other noncommercial customers, weekly shipments during the most recent weeks have been 70% to 75% of prior year levels, including solid recovery in sales of Lamb Weston branded products. Weekly shipments to Retail customers in the most recent weeks have been 5% to 10% more than prior year levels as food-at-home purchases begin to normalize pre-COVID rates. Our growth has been led by our branded products.
In Europe, shipments to date by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture are around 75% of prior year levels. Early in the quarter, weekly shipments were trending at more than 65% and have recovered to around 80% in the most recent weeks as more countries ease restrictions and consumers gain confidence about dining in restaurants. In China, which is included in our Global segment, shipments to date are approximately 85% of prior year levels, with monthly shipments improving from about 80% in May to more than 95% in the most recent weeks. Demand in our other key international markets, which are also included in our Global segment, has softened since the end of the fourth quarter. In Japan, customers have been destocking inventories due to postponement of the Olympics.
In sum, the amount and pace of recovery in fry demand has been better than what we had anticipated when the crisis first arose. QSRs in the U.S. have bounced back faster than we expected, while full-service restaurants have also recovered somewhat faster due to states easing restrictions. Demand in Europe and China has progressed largely in line with our expectations, while other international markets are a bit softer. However, to be clear, we believe that this improvement remains fragile as COVID cases continue to rise in the U.S. and in Latin America. We are currently seeing evidence of orders slowing after some states recently placed restrictions for on-premise dining at restaurants. We expect that this high degree of uncertainty will likely continue until the pandemic has ended and consumer confidence has been restored.
With respect to costs, as Tom discussed, we've taken a range of actions to reduce our cost profile. We'd expect to continue to incur incremental costs and expenses, resulting from the pandemic's impact on our operations. For example, these include expenses to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols throughout the company; cost to modify production schedules and reducing run times, thereby suboptimizing plant and labor utilization; cost to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities when necessary; and cost to produce retail products on foodservice-oriented production lines.
So as you can see, it was a challenging quarter where we've executed well and took the necessary actions to maintain through a potentially volatile period going forward.
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

We believe that the tough decisions we made and the actions we've taken have us well positioned for fiscal 2021 and beyond.
The recovery in demand these past few months has been encouraging, with solid improvements in most of our channels, especially at QSRs. While we expect there will be some bumps on the road to recovery, we'll continue to overcome them as the year progresses. Our long-term view remains the same, and we remain confident in our strategies, our ability to generate top and bottom line growth and create value for all our stakeholders.

And what's manageable today is different tomorrow, it's different yesterday. But we do have a lens of future demand based on orders in the system. Now it's narrowed down a lot from what it used to be just because of the uncertainty in the channels. So it's -- again, it's ensuring as best we can with the disruptions we're having in our manufacturing plants, making sure we've got taking care of the key customers. Certainly, we're having some challenges with the plant shut down, but the demand signal -- we look at a lot of data, just like every other company, the demand signal is the key that's going to drive the near term going forward. Certainly, when we have some of these contracts done and behind us, that's helpful, but that's not necessarily an indicator on the demand forecast because the historical demand that we would have with these big customers has completely changed. So we're hand to mouth right now on what they're seeing in their store and store traffic.
As you can imagine, with the things that are going on in the environment, in the U.S. specifically of some of our bigger markets that are -- have more spikes in cases and more restrictions, the signal is mixed. So -- but the encouraging thing to all this is over the past 6, 8 weeks, as Rob alluded to, the things we look at, it's hanging in there pretty well across all of our channels. But the whole key to this is demand signal. And we look at a lot of different data. We certainly have a lens on what our forward orders look like. But the outlook period is a lot shorter than what it used to be, but we're monitoring it closely."

And I'm just trying to really think about those incremental kind of production costs that you laid out in the press release and how much of that was more onetime? How much of that is more recurring as long as you've got this kind of the COVID issues playing? And maybe finally, how would you frame how to think about the decremental gross margins as your volumes are certainly still down year-on-year, just over the next the 3 months to 12 months?"

And if you look at that $22 million, $14 million of that was related to the 20 -- or the 2019 crop write-off. And so there may be some tweaking and true-up here in Q1 as we finalize those discussions with the growers. But not likely that, that's going to recur in our minds. Transportation, warehousing, inefficiencies may have some recurrence of some of that, but hopefully, we would -- the steps we've taken to improve and the additional volume pushing through that we're getting should help that as well. And then you go to the utilization costs and really, that's the tough -- that's the one that's really tough to forecast because that's largely driven by really jerking around production schedules. So think about it as we've got a production schedule in a plant to go run, couple of people show up after a long weekend with COVID, and we don't have enough people, and we don't have the assurance to continue to run that line and keep people safe and healthy. And so we then take a step to shut that down. I have no idea how to forecast that. And so that's one that you look at that $25 million and it's hard for me to get my head around that we're not going to continue to incur some of those costs. And I'll tell you, in Q1, we have had some additional hits and some shutdowns and restarts and sanitizations of the lines. So that's the way I think about it. I know it's not perfect information, but I think that's reality of what we're dealing with here."

And what we saw in Q4, hopefully, right, would be the worst. And now we can kind of work our way back because demand has been created, the harvest seems okay, contract lowers, supply orders actually came in decently. And basically, our forecasting might actually prove out to be okay, and we might actually be in a pretty good spot once we get to the end of the year. I mean, that's the hope.

We got -- we have the entire organization focused on business recovery plans and cost savings. And so you step back, and I feel the company is focused. We're going to have bumps in the road. There's no question about it. But the thing -- the big things that we decisioned in the last 90 days, 100% confident that it's the path forward. And now we just got to operate this business over the next 12 months, it's going to be bumpy. We'll make adjustments as we need to, but we got everybody focused. So I feel good about where the company sits right now."

I mean it's not a huge amount of money in the grand scheme of the year. Other than that, again, we'll keep SG&A pretty tight for the year unless and until we see any light on the horizon."

So I think the whole industry is going to do that around the globe. And I don't -- I expect that there could be some footprint changes. There's -- as demand recovers to levels in a couple of years that we've experienced, there's going to continually be investment in capacity at some point down the road.

In terms of those costs, again, I think that as you look through those, I broke them down into the $25 million related to utilization and the $22 million that was not related to utilization. Of that $22 million, again, a big chunk of that was related to raw write-off related to 2019 crop and settling those contracts. And so I would not expect anything material out of that to recur or extend other than there may be some minor true-ups here that we clean up in Q1, but it's going to be much smaller than what we saw previously. And then I said there were some capital write-offs that we had in the quarter that don't anticipate those will recur. And then transportation warehousing, I said that expect those to improve versus what we saw in Q4 may still have some, but they'll be better.
On the utilization costs, the $25 million of utilization costs, as Tom and I talked through, it's really tough to predict and to forecast what's going to happen because those are largely driven by a couple of things: One, what's happening on the demand signal; and two, what's happening in terms of employee health as they show up for work. We can keep them safe at work and keep them healthy at work. But outside of work as they circulate in the community, they may get sick, and so we may have unexpected shutdowns of plants. And so that's what's driving that $25 million is that utilization that is tied to both of those issues. So that's the one that I would expect will have some recurrence. Hopefully, we're getting better and smarter at managing those costs. But that's the one where there's a risk, I think."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families continue to be well. Let me just start off by saying that I feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we are executing as a company. This is a testament to the Lamb Weston team, and I want to thank them for their commitment to each other and our company as well as their continued service to our customers, suppliers and communities. 
As we navigate this challenging environment, our first priority remains ensuring the health and safety of our employees. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have instituted more rigorous operating protocols across the company, especially for our production and frontline teams that work to keep feeding the world while keeping our manufacturing facilities and product safe. 
In some cases, this has created additional burdens for our team members and their families. And I want to thank them for their commitment and understanding. I continue to be inspired by the spirit of teamwork that our employees show every day, and that makes me proud to be a part of this great company. 
In addition to the hard work by our team, our improved financial performance versus our fourth quarter of 2020 reflects 2 broad factors. First, the operating environment has steadily recovered over the past few months with restaurant traffic and fry demand improving in North America in most of our key markets. Second, we have gotten better at managing through the disruption that the pandemic has created in our manufacturing operations as well as controlling costs across the business. 
With respect to the operating environment, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement, breadth and pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand. However, we also remain cautious about the uncertainty of the recovery stability with COVID continuing to be a challenge in the U.S. and some key international markets. 
In the U.S., overall restaurant traffic and fry demand steadily improved early in the quarter, then largely stabilized at levels that were below what we saw just before the pandemic. Traffic at large quick-service chain restaurants approached prior year levels, especially during the latter half of the quarter by leveraging drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. 
Full-service restaurant traffic also improved as the quarter progressed, then stabilized at about 75% to 80% of prior year levels as governments relax restriction for on-premise dining. And restaurants lean more on carryout delivery and outdoor dining to generate sales. 
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and university, sports and entertainment and workplace environments remain at less than 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter, although it did improve modestly as the quarter progressed. 
In retail, demand growth in the quarter was strong. After peaking a more than 50% weekly category volume growth in April and May, weekly volume growth steadily moderated to between 15% and 20% growth by August as restrictions on restaurants eased. 
In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. Although it's important to note that demand at this time last year was somewhat soft for us due to a Frozen Potato crop. 
Demand improvement in our other year in international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand steadily improved and approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, the improvement in demand was uneven as governments employed differing approaches to contain the spread of the virus. 
In short, demand steadily improved in the U.S. and across most of our international markets as summer progressed, then stabilized below pre-pandemic levels. Along with that steady recovery in demand, our teams leveraged lessons learned when COVID first hit and have adapted our operations to better manage through the current environment. 
As I noted earlier, since the onset of the pandemic, we've stepped up our employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations, which has resulted in earlier detection of COVID among our workforce. We've also steadily become more efficient in minimizing disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and service levels, including isolating specific areas of our facilities that would be needed to shut down, sanitize and restart after members of our protection team are affected by the virus as well as increasing flexibility to adjust production schedules and run times across the network. 
Our supply chain team has been able to significantly reduce our incremental production cost inefficiency as compared to what we heard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We've also taken a range of steps to aggressively manage our selling, general and administrative expenses, including shutting down all travel and large meetings and to bring other discretionary expenditures and projects. However, one project that we did not defer was implementing Phase 1 of our new enterprise resource planning system, as we believe it will be a key enabler to driving efficiencies over the long term. We are currently evaluating options for when to begin implementing Phase 2. 
Before handing the call off to Rob, let me update you on the potato crop in the pricing environment. With respect to the crop, on a preliminary basis, we believe the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest will be consistent with historical averages in the aggregate. Our early read on the European potato crop is that it will also be consistent with historical averages, and that's a welcome sign given the poor crops in recent years. 
As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality and how we expect the crop to hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. With respect to contract discussions and pricing, we're largely through the negotiations for the domestic large chain restaurant contracts that are up for renewal this year. And in the aggregate, we have maintained stable pricing in the portfolio. For those contracts yet to be finalized, we'll remain disciplined and take an approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. 
Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts, on balance, domestic pricing continues to hold up well. However, we have begun to see increased competitive activity in some domestic market segments as well as more value-oriented product segments in some international markets. As demand continues to strengthen, we expect pricing pressure in these segments will lessen. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we're executing as a company. We're optimistic about the positive demand trends in the U.S. and in our key international markets, but we remain cautious due to the continued uncertainty with the current operating environment. We're navigating through the crisis by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, leveraging our manufacturing footprint and operational agility to make sure we service customers and aggressively controlling costs across the entire company. 
And finally, we're encouraged about the health of this year's crop as well as the overall pricing stability across our portfolio. These are challenging times, which we expect will be around for a while, but we also believe that by focusing on our strategies and our commitment to our employees and servicing our customers will emerge as a stronger company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,688395461,2107924,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2020",2020-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providing",2201,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providing a backdrop for us to deliver a 3% sequential sales growth in our first quarter. The sequential increase in earnings was more dramatic. We nearly doubled gross profit from $111 million to $214 million, and increased EBITDA, including joint ventures, by more than 2.5x from $78 million to $202 million, as we increased operating leverage, and we greatly improved our ability to control costs and manage through the disruption that pandemic has on our manufacturing network and distribution chain. 
While our results remain below pre-pandemic levels and down versus prior year, the sequential improvement in the demand environment and our financial performance is encouraging. 
Now turning to our year-over-year results. Net sales declined 12% versus prior year quarter to $872 million. Sales volume was down 14% as frozen potato demand outside the home continue to be affected by government-imposed restrictions on restaurant traffic and other food service operations. However, after realizing some benefit from customers reloading inventories early in the first quarter, our weekly shipment trends in each of our domestic channels and most of our international markets steadily improved as the quarter progressed. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing our business segment performance. 
Price/mix increased 2% due to improvements in both the Foodservice and Retail segments. Gross profit declined $35 million with about $16 million due to pandemic related costs on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. That $16 million is down from $47 million of pandemic related production costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Of the $16 million, about $6 million were utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. That compares to about $25 million of costs for utilization related costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules and reducing run times across our network to compensate for facilities impacted by COVID; and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to manufacturing retail products online's primarily designed for Foodservice products. 
The other $10 million of the $16 million consists of nonutilization related costs, and included about $3 million of expense to the remaining crop year 2019 raw potato purchase obligations and about $7 million for enhanced employee safety, sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. 
As we previously discussed, we expect to incur utilization and nonutilization related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing and supply chain operations are impacted by the pandemic. The remaining $19 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable price/mix, a $5 million year-over-year change in mark-to-market adjustments and cost efficiency savings. 
SG&A in the quarter was essentially flat. Cost management efforts, including a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense offset $1 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with implementing our new ERP system and $4 million of pandemic-related expenses, largely related to net costs of retaining certain sales employees. 
Equity method earnings were $12 million, up $1 million from last year. However, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $2 million, with half due to pandemic-related costs similar to what we incurred in our base business. While down versus last year, equity earnings increased sequentially as a result of significant decline in pandemic-related costs in the first quarter as well as steady improvements in our weekly shipments by our European joint venture. 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $202 million from $31 million. About $21 million of the decline was due to pandemic-related costs I've discussed. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales and gross profit. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.61, down $0.18 or 23% from last year. 
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based QSR and full-service restaurant change as well as all sales outside of North America, were down 14% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Volumes fell 13% due to the decline in demand for fries outside of the home. However, weekly shipments to large QSR chains, which historically comprise about 1/2 Global segment sales, improved from around 85% of prior year levels at the end of May to near prior year levels by the end of the first quarter. Weekly shipments to large full-service change, historically comprised about 10% of global sales, improved from 45% to 50% in May to 70% to 80% by the end of the first quarter, as governments Relic restrictions on on-premise dining and as restaurants improved carryout and delivery capabilities. 
International sales which historically comprised about 40% of segment sales were mixed. As Tom noted, monthly shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter as demand steadily improved. Monthly shipment trends in other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America were uneven. This mirrored pattern in demand recovery, but also generally lagged as the rate of customer -- the lag the rate of improvement customers and distributors in these markets continue to rightsize their inventories. 
Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined $25 million to $78 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for about $9 million of the decline, with the remainder driven by lower sales. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 6% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of fiscal '20. 
Mix was unfavorable for 2 reasons. First, independent restaurants, which purchased a high amount of Lamb Weston branded products have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And second, some customers have traded down to more value-oriented products in order to reduce costs. It's important to note that this impact was more pronounced in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we've steadily regained much of this business as restaurant traffic improved in recent months. 
Volume declined 28%, reflecting the continued impact that government-imposed restrictions have had on consumer traffic. Our weekly shipments to full-service and small and regional quick-service restaurants, which together have historically compromised 3 quarters of the segment sales, improved to 80% to 85% of prior year sales by the end of the first quarter. Our weekly shipments to noncommercial outlets, which have historically compromised the other 25% of the segment sales, modestly improved as the quarter progressed, but were soft at about 50% of prior year levels. 
Foodservices product contribution margin declined $17 million to $86 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $4 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, offset by favorable price/mix. 
Sales in our retail segment increased 19% in the quarter. Volume increased 11%, although this masks the performance of our branded portfolio, which historically has compromised about 40% of the segment's volume. Our brands are winning. Volume growth of our grown in Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products was up together more than 30% in the quarter. That's well above weekly category volume growth rates, which range between 15% and 25%. However, Retail segment's volume growth was partially offset by applying in private label shipments, which reflects the loss of certain low-margin private label business that largely began during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting that favorable mix of more branded products. Retail product contribution margin increased $7 million to $36 million and was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense. This increase was partially offset by $3 million of pandemic-related costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position, in the first quarter, we generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. That's up $12 million versus last year. Our top priorities in deploying cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent $33 million in CapEx, including for a new ERP system. Given the outlook for the business, cash flow and improved liquidity position were increasing our capital expenditures target for the year to $180 million from $140 million. As we invest in productivity and optimization projects as well as some targeted growth capacity. With respect to capital returns, we declared a regular quarterly dividend 2 weeks ago. 
Since the pandemic began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. In September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3 year, $750 million revolver to replace the $500 million facility that was set to expire in November of 2021. The new revolver remains undrawn and fully available. 
In conjunction with the revolver, with more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we chose to prepay the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November 2021. All in, the financing actions we've taken since pandemic began, have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, lowered our weighted average interest rate and stretched our debt amortization, while only increasing our expected annual after tax interest payments by about $11 million. So along with our current -- so along with our ability to continue to generate cash, we feel good about our current liquidity position. 
Now turning to some demand trends that we're seeing in the second quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments have largely stabilized during the latter half of the first quarter and into the first 4 weeks of September. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date in the second quarter are approximately 90% of prior year levels. 
In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. are trending at around 95% of prior year levels. While QSRs are likely to be largely unaffected, we anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants could take a step back as outdoor dining options become more limited with the onset of colder weather. 
In our Foodservice segment, weekly shipments to our full-service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate are trending at approximately 80% of prior year levels. Shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs have been trending above that rate but could soften due to old weather. Shipments to noncommercial customers have been trending well below that rate and are likely to remain so until spread of COVID is broadly contained. 
In our Retail segment, weekly shipments are trending even with prior year levels with strong volume growth of our branded products, offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. In Europe, weekly shipments to date in the second quarter by our European joint venture, are approaching prior year levels. Although consumer demand at this time last year was such soft due to high prices and quality concerns as a result of the poor crop. As in the U.S., we believe that shipments to full-service restaurants in Europe may also begin to soften as cold weather reduces outdoor dining options. 
Shipment trends in our other international markets are mixed. In China and Australia, shipments are approaching prior year levels. In other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America, demand has improved since the end of the first quarter, although our shipments continue to generally lag demand improvements as customers and distributors continue to rightsize their inventories. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global segments results. 
In short, overall demand across our markets is largely consistent with what we observed during the latter half of the first quarter, although we remain cautious about the effect of the onset of colder weather on outdoor dining as well as the continuing spread of the virus in the U.S. and its resurgence in some key international markets. 
In addition, when estimating sales for the quarter, recall that our second quarter results last year benefited from strong sales, customized products, including limited time offerings as well as from additional shipping days related to the timing of the Thanksgiving Holiday. 
With respect to costs, as we've previously discussed, we plan to process potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We stretched out the old crop in order to manage inventories in light of the pandemics impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in higher cost as a result of higher raw potato storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize the impact of these higher costs in our second quarter income statement as we sell that inventory over the coming months. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

And you have flare-ups and COVID hotspots. We certainly have data where we look at the markets that are potentially put more restrictions on. We're watching those ordering patterns very closely.

But again, that's -- we'll reassess that as the market recovers. In terms of freight cost, I've heard others have had challenges with some near-term freight. We tend to contract a lot of our trucking as opposed to play a lot in the spot market, where we've had some freight volatility, maybe more in Q4 is -- early in Q1, as we were trying to catch up those inventories and hot shotting some things our rail, truck freight had some negative impact to it. But that -- we pretty well stabilized. And again, so because we contract the trucking largely, we're not as exposed as maybe some others that you may have heard."

And we're getting -- like I noted in my remarks, we're a lot better at adjusting and moving production around when we have a disruption to service our customers, which also -- there's a cost element to that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families continue to be well. Let me just start off by saying that I feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we are executing as a company. This is a testament to the Lamb Weston team, and I want to thank them for their commitment to each other and our company as well as their continued service to our customers, suppliers and communities.  
As we navigate this challenging environment, our first priority remains ensuring the health and safety of our employees. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have instituted more rigorous operating protocols across the company. Especially for our production and frontline teams that work to keep feeding the world while keeping our manufacturing facilities and product safe.  
In some cases, this has created additional burdens for our team members and their families. And I want to thank them for their commitment and understanding. I continue to be inspired by the spirit of teamwork that our employees show every day, and that makes me proud to be a part of this great company.  
In addition to the hard work by our team, our improved financial performance versus our fourth quarter 2020 reflects 2 broad factors. First, the operating environment has steadily recovered over the past few months with restaurant traffic and fry demand improving in North America in most of our key markets. Second, we have gotten better at managing through the disruption that the pandemic has created in our manufacturing operations as well as controlling costs across the business.  
With respect to the operating environment, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement, breadth and pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand. However, we also remain cautious about the uncertainty of the recovery stability with COVID continuing to be a challenge in the U.S. and some key international markets.  
In the U.S., overall restaurant traffic and fry demand steadily improved early in the quarter, then largely stabilized at levels that were below what we saw just before the pandemic. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants approached prior year levels, especially during the latter half of the quarter by leveraging drive-through, takeout and delivery formats.  Full-service restaurant traffic also improved as the quarter progressed, then stabilized at about 75% to 80% of prior year levels as governments relax restriction for on-premise dining. And restaurants lean more on carryout delivery and outdoor dining to generate sales.  
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers, which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environments remain at less than 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter, although it did improve modestly as the quarter progressed.  
In retail, demand growth in the quarter was strong. After peaking a more than 50% weekly category volume growth in April and May, weekly volume growth steadily moderated to between 15% and 20% growth by August as restrictions on restaurants eased.  
In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. Although it's important to note that demand at this time last year was somewhat soft for us due to a poor potato crop.  
Demand improvement in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand steadily improved and approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, the improvement in demand was uneven as governments employed differing approaches to contain the spread of the virus. In short, demand steadily improved in the U.S. and across most of our international markets as summer progressed, then stabilized below pre-pandemic levels. Along with that steady recovery in demand, our teams leveraged lessons learned when COVID first hit and have adapted our operations to better manage through the current environment.  
As I noted earlier, since the onset of the pandemic, we've stepped up our employees safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations, which has resulted in earlier detection of COVID among our workforce. We've also steadily become more efficient in minimizing disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and service levels, including isolating specific areas of our facilities that would be needed to shut down, sanitize and restart after members of our protection team are affected by the virus as well as increasing flexibility to adjust production schedules and run times across the network.  
Our supply chain team has been able to significantly reduce our incremental production cost inefficiency as compared to what we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We've also taken a range of steps to aggressively manage our selling, general and administrative expenses, including shutting down all travel and large meetings and differing other discretionary expenditures and projects. However, one project that we did not defer was implementing Phase 1 of our new enterprise resource planning system as we believe it will be a key enabler to driving efficiencies over the long term. We are currently evaluating options for when to begin implementing Phase 2.  
Before handing the call off to Rob, let me update you on the potato crop and the pricing environment. With respect to the crop, on a preliminary basis, we believe the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest will be consistent with historical averages in the aggregate. Our early read on the European potato crop is that it will also be consistent with historical averages, and that's a welcome sign given the poor crops in recent years.  
As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality and how we expect the crop to hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. With respect to contract discussions and pricing, we're largely through the negotiations for the domestic large chain restaurant contracts that are up for renewal this year. And in the aggregate, we have maintained stable pricing in the portfolio. For those contracts yet to be finalized, we'll remain disciplined and take an approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships.  
Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts, on balance, domestic pricing continues to hold up well. However, we have begun to see increased competitive activity in some domestic market segments as well as more value-oriented product segments in some international markets. As demand continues to strengthen, we expect pricing pressure in these segments will lessen. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we're executing as a company. We're optimistic about the positive demand trends in the U.S. and in our key international markets, but we remain cautious due to the continued uncertainty with the current operating environment. We're navigating through the crisis by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, leveraging our manufacturing footprint and operational agility to make sure we service customers and aggressively controlling costs across the entire company.  
And finally, we're encouraged about the health of this year's crop as well as the overall pricing stability across our portfolio. These are challenging times, which we expect will be around for a while, but we also believe that by focusing on our strategies and our commitment to our employees and servicing our customers we'll emerge as a stronger company.  
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,688395461,2107996,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2020",2020-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic's effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providin",2207,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic's effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providing a backdrop for us to deliver a 3% sequential sales growth in our first quarter. 
The sequential increase in earnings was more dramatic. We nearly doubled gross profit from $111 million to $214 million, and increased EBITDA, including joint ventures, by more than 2.5x from $78 million to $202 million, as we increased operating leverage, and we greatly improved our ability to control costs and manage through the disruption that pandemic has on our manufacturing network and distribution chain. While our results remain below pre-pandemic levels and down versus prior year, the sequential improvement in the demand environment and our financial performance is encouraging. 
Now turning to our year-over-year results. Net sales declined 12% versus prior year quarter to $872 million. Sales volume was down 14% as frozen potato demand outside the home continue to be affected by government-imposed restrictions on restaurant traffic and other food service operations. However, after realizing some benefit from customers reloading inventories early in the first quarter, our weekly shipment trends in each of our domestic channels and most of our international markets steadily improved as the quarter progressed. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing our business segment performance.  
Price/mix increased 2% due to improvements in both the Foodservice and Retail segments. Gross profit declined $35 million with about $16 million due to pandemic related costs on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. That $16 million is down from $47 million of pandemic related production costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.  
Of the $16 million, about $6 million were utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. That compares to about $25 million of costs for utilization related costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules and reducing run times across our network to compensate for facilities impacted by COVID; and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products.  
The other $10 million of the $16 million consists of nonutilization related costs, and included about $3 million of expense to the remaining crop year 2019 raw potato purchase obligations and about $7 million for enhanced employee safety, sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs.  
As we previously discussed, we expect to incur utilization and nonutilization related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing and supply chain operations are impacted by the pandemic. The remaining $19 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable price/mix, a $5 million year-over-year change in mark-to-market adjustments and cost efficiency savings.  
SG&A in the quarter was essentially flat. Cost management efforts, including a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense offset $1 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with implementing our new ERP system and $4 million of pandemic-related expenses, largely related to net costs of retaining certain sales employees.  
Equity method earnings were $12 million, up $1 million from last year. However, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $2 million. With half due to pandemic-related costs similar to what we incurred in our base business. While down versus last year, equity earnings increased sequentially as a result of significant decline in pandemic-related costs in the first quarter as well as steady improvements in our weekly shipments by our European joint venture.  
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $202 million down $31 million. About $21 million of the decline was due to pandemic-related costs I've discussed. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales and gross profit.  Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.61, down $0.18 or 23% from last year.  
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America were down 14% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Volumes fell 13% due to the decline in demand for fries outside of the home. However, weekly shipments to large QSR chains, which historically comprise about 1/2 of Global segment sales, improved from around 85% of prior year levels at the end of May to near prior year levels by the end of the first quarter. Weekly shipments to large full-service chains, which historically comprised about 10% of global sales, improved from 45% to 50% in May to 70% to 80% by the end of the first quarter, as governments relaxed restrictions on on-premise dining and as restaurants improved carryout and delivery capabilities. International sales which historically comprise about 40% of segment sales were mixed. As Tom noted, monthly shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter as demand steadily improved.   Monthly shipment trends in other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America were uneven. This mirrored pattern in demand recovery, but also generally lagged as the rate of customer -- lagged the rate of improvement as customers and distributors in these markets continue to rightsize their inventories.  Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined $25 million to $78 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for about $9 million of the decline, with the remainder driven by lower sales.  
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 6% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of the fiscal '20.  
Mix was unfavorable for 2 reasons. First, independent restaurants, which purchased a high amount of Lamb Weston branded products have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And second, some customers have traded down to more value-oriented products in order to reduce costs. It's important to note that this impact was more pronounced in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we've steadily regained much of this business as restaurant traffic improved in recent months.  
Volume declined 28%, reflecting the continued impact that government-imposed restrictions have had on consumer traffic. Our weekly shipments to full-service and small and regional quick-service restaurants, which together have historically compromised 3 quarters of the segment sales, improved to 80% to 85% of prior year sales by the end of the first quarter. Our weekly shipments to noncommercial outlets, which have historically compromised the other 25% of the segment sales, modestly improved as the quarter progressed, but were soft at about 50% of prior year levels.  
Foodservices product contribution margin declined $17 million to $86 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $4 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, offset by favorable price/mix. 
Sales in our retail segment increased 19% in the quarter. Volume increased 11%. Although this masks the performance of our branded portfolio, which historically has compromised about 40% of the segment's volume. 
Our brands are winning. Volume growth of our Grown In Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products was up together more than 30% in the quarter. That's well above weekly category volume growth rates, which range between 15% and 25%. However, Retail segment's volume growth was partially offset by decline in private label shipments, which reflects the loss of certain low-margin private label business that largely began during the third quarter of fiscal 2020.  
Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting that favorable mix of more branded products. Retail product contribution margin increased $7 million to $36 million and was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense. This increase was partially offset by $3 million of pandemic-related costs.  
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. in the first quarter, we generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. That's up $12 million versus last year. Our top priorities in deploying cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent $33 million in CapEx, including for a new ERP system. Given the outlook for the business, cash flow and improved liquidity position we're increasing our capital expenditures target for the year to $180 million from $140 million.  As we invest in productivity and optimization projects as well as some targeted growth capacity. With respect to capital returns, we declared a regular quarterly dividend 2 weeks ago. 
Since the pandemic began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. In September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3 year, $750 million revolver to replace the $500 million facility that was set to expire in November of 2021. The new revolver remains undrawn and fully available.  
In conjunction with the revolver, with more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we chose to prepay the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November 2021. All in, the financing actions we've taken since pandemic began, have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, lowered our weighted average interest rate and stretched our debt amortization, while only increasing our expected annual after tax interest payments by about $11 million.  So along with our current -- so along with our ability to continue to generate cash, we feel good about our current liquidity position. 
Now turning to some demand trends that we're seeing in the second quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments have largely stabilized during the latter half of the first quarter and into the first 4 weeks of September. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date in the second quarter are approximately 90% of prior year levels.  
In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. are trending at around 95% of prior year levels. While QSRs are likely to be largely unaffected, we anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants could take a step back as outdoor dining options become more limited with the onset of colder weather.  
In our Foodservice segment, weekly shipments to our full-service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate are trending at approximately 80% of prior year levels. Shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs have been trending above that rate but could soften due to colder weather. Shipments to noncommercial customers have been trending well below that rate and are likely to remain so until the spread of COVID is broadly contained.  
In our Retail segment, weekly shipments are trending even with prior year levels with strong volume growth of our branded products, offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. In Europe, weekly shipments to date in the second quarter by our European joint venture, are approaching prior year levels. Although consumer demand at this time last year was somewhat soft due to high prices and quality concerns as a result of the poor crop. As in the U.S., we believe that shipments to full-service restaurants in Europe may also begin to soften as cold weather reduces outdoor dining options.  
Shipment trends in our other international markets are mixed. In China and Australia, shipments are approaching prior year levels. In other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America, demand has improved since the end of the first quarter, although our shipments continue to generally lag demand improvements as customers and distributors continue to rightsize their inventories. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global segments results.  
In short, overall demand across our markets is largely consistent with what we observed during the latter half of the first quarter. Although we remain cautious about the effect of the onset of colder weather on outdoor dining,as well as the continuing spread of the virus in the U.S. and its resurgence in some key international markets.  
In addition, when estimating sales for the quarter, recall that our second quarter results of last year benefited from strong sales of customized products, including limited time offerings as well as from additional shipping days related to the timing of the Thanksgiving Holiday.  
With respect to costs, as we've previously discussed, we plan to process potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We stretched out the old crop in order to manage inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in higher cost as a result of higher raw potato storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize the impact of these higher costs in our second quarter income statement as we sell that inventory over the coming months.  
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

But again, that's -- we'll reassess that as the market recovers. In terms of freight cost, I've heard others have had challenges with some near-term freight. 
We tend to contract a lot of our trucking as opposed to play a lot in the spot market, where we've had some freight volatility, maybe more in Q4 is -- early in Q1, as we were trying to catch up those inventories and hot shotting some things our rail, truck freight had some negative impact to it. But that -- we pretty well stabilized. And again, so because we contract the trucking largely, we're not as exposed as maybe some others that you may have heard."

Now we know the absolute number historically. But it's about running production as much as you can in light of the disruptions we're experiencing, and they've gotten a lot better. 
And we're getting -- like I noted in my remarks, we're a lot better at adjusting and moving production around when we have a disruption to service our customers, which also -- there's a cost element to that.

And that's been implemented and is now operating. And standard ERP exercise, not perfect, but not horrible. It's all -- it's fine and operating well. The team has done a great job with it. 
In terms of Release 2, that impacts more customer-facing and inventory elements. And given the current environment, we're really stepped back from that. One, to let the key people in the business run the business in this challenging time. And two, just managing through the risk. So we're going through the assessment now to determine what the timing is to do that, but we haven't relaunched it at this point."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families continue to be well. Let me just start off by saying that I feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we are executing as a company. This is a testament to the Lamb Weston team, and I want to thank them for their commitment to each other and our company as well as their continued service to our customers, suppliers and communities. 
As we navigate this challenging environment, our first priority remains ensuring the health and safety of our employees. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have instituted more rigorous operating protocols across the company, especially for our production and frontline teams that work to keep feeding the world while keeping our manufacturing facilities and products safe. 
In some cases, this has created additional burdens for our team members and their families. And I want to thank them for their commitment and understanding. I continue to be inspired by the spirit of teamwork that our employees show every day, and that makes me proud to be a part of this great company. 
In addition to the hard work by our team, our improved financial performance versus our fourth quarter 2020 reflects 2 broad factors. First, the operating environment has steadily recovered over the past few months with restaurant traffic and fry demand improving in North America in most of our key markets. Second, we have gotten better at managing through the disruption that the pandemic has created in our manufacturing operations as well as controlling costs across the business. 
With respect to the operating environment, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement, breadth and pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand. However, we also remain cautious about the uncertainty of the recovery stability with COVID continuing to be a challenge in the U.S. and some key international markets. 
In the U.S., overall restaurant traffic and fry demand steadily improved early in the quarter, then largely stabilized at levels that were below what we saw just before the pandemic. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants approached prior year levels, especially during the latter half of the quarter by leveraging drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Full-service restaurant traffic also improved as the quarter progressed, then stabilized at about 75% to 80% of prior year levels as governments relax restriction for on-premise dining, and restaurants lean more on carryout and delivery and outdoor dining to generate sales. 
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers -- which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environments -- remain at less than 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter, although it did improve modestly as the quarter progressed. 
 
In retail, demand growth in the quarter was strong. After peaking a more than 50% weekly category volume growth in April and May, weekly volume growth steadily moderated to between 15% and 20% growth by August as restrictions on restaurants eased. 
In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. Although it's important to note that demand at this time last year was somewhat soft for us due to a poor potato crop. 
Demand improvement in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand steadily improved and approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, the improvement in demand was uneven as governments employed differing approaches to contain the spread of the virus. In short, demand steadily improved in the U.S. and across most of our international markets as summer progressed, then stabilized below pre-pandemic levels. Along with that steady recovery in demand, our teams leveraged lessons learned when COVID first hit and have adapted our operations to better manage through the current environment. 
As I noted earlier, since the onset of the pandemic, we've stepped up our employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations, which has resulted in earlier detection of COVID among our workforce. We've also steadily become more efficient in minimizing disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and service levels, including isolating specific areas of our facilities that would be needed to shut down, sanitize and restart after members of our production team are affected by the virus as well as increasing flexibility to adjust production schedules and run times across the network. 
Our supply chain team has been able to significantly reduce our incremental production cost inefficiency as compared to what we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We've also taken a range of steps to aggressively manage our selling, general and administrative expenses, including shutting down all travel and large meetings and deferring other discretionary expenditures and projects. However, one project that we did not defer was implementing Phase 1 of our new enterprise resource planning system as we believe it will be a key enabler to driving efficiencies over the long term. We are currently evaluating options for when to begin implementing Phase 2. 
Before handing the call off to Rob, let me update you on the potato crop and the pricing environment. With respect to the crop, on a preliminary basis, we believe the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest will be consistent with historical averages in the aggregate. Our early read on the European potato crop is that it will also be consistent with historical averages, and that's a welcome sign given the poor crops in recent years. 
As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality and how we expect the crop to hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. With respect to contract discussions and pricing, we're largely through the negotiations for the domestic large chain restaurant contracts that are up for renewal this year. And in the aggregate, we have maintained stable pricing in the portfolio. For those contracts yet to be finalized, we'll remain disciplined and take an approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. 
Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts, on balance, domestic pricing continues to hold up well. However, we have begun to see increased competitive activity in some domestic market segments as well as more value-oriented product segments in some international markets. As demand continues to strengthen, we expect pricing pressure in these segments will lessen. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we're executing as a company. We're optimistic about the positive demand trends in the U.S. and in our key international markets, but we remain cautious due to the continued uncertainty with the current operating environment. We're navigating through the crisis by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, leveraging our manufacturing footprint and operational agility to make sure we service customers and aggressively controlling costs across the entire company. 
And finally, we're encouraged about the health of this year's crop as well as the overall pricing stability across our portfolio. These are challenging times, which we expect will be around for a while, but we also believe that by focusing on our strategies and our commitment to our employees and servicing our customers we'll emerge as a stronger company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."
374372246,688395461,2145662,"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2020",2020-10-07,"Earnings Calls","Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic's effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providin",2219,"Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic's effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providing a backdrop for us to deliver a 3% sequential sales growth in our first quarter. 
The sequential increase in earnings was more dramatic. We nearly doubled gross profit from $111 million to $214 million, and increased EBITDA, including joint ventures, by more than 2.5x from $78 million to $202 million, as we increased operating leverage, and we greatly improved our ability to control costs and manage through the disruption that pandemic has on our manufacturing network and distribution chain. While our results remain below pre-pandemic levels and down versus prior year, the sequential improvement in the demand environment and our financial performance is encouraging. 
Now turning to our year-over-year results. Net sales declined 12% versus prior year quarter to $872 million. Sales volume was down 14% as frozen potato demand outside the home continue to be affected by government-imposed restrictions on restaurant traffic and other food service operations. However, after realizing some benefit from customers reloading inventories early in the first quarter, our weekly shipment trends in each of our domestic channels and most of our international markets steadily improved as the quarter progressed. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing our business segment performance. 
Price/mix increased 2% due to improvements in both the Foodservice and Retail segments. Gross profit declined $35 million with about $16 million due to pandemic related costs on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. That $16 million is down from $47 million of pandemic related production costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Of the $16 million, about $6 million were utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. That compares to about $25 million of costs for utilization related costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules and reducing run times across our network to compensate for facilities impacted by COVID; and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products. 
The other $10 million of the $16 million consists of nonutilization related costs, and included about $3 million of expense to the remaining crop year 2019 raw potato purchase obligations and about $7 million for enhanced employee safety, sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. 
As we previously discussed, we expect to incur utilization and nonutilization related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing and supply chain operations are impacted by the pandemic. The remaining $19 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable price/mix, a $5 million year-over-year change in mark-to-market adjustments and cost efficiency savings. 
SG&A in the quarter was essentially flat. Cost management efforts, including a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense offset $1 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with implementing our new ERP system and $4 million of pandemic-related expenses, largely related to net costs of retaining certain sales employees. 
Equity method earnings were $12 million, up $1 million from last year. However, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $2 million, with half due to pandemic-related costs similar to what we incurred in our base business. While down versus last year, equity earnings increased sequentially as a result of significant decline in pandemic-related costs in the first quarter as well as steady improvements in our weekly shipments by our European joint venture. 
 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $202 million down $31 million. About $21 million of the decline was due to pandemic-related costs I've discussed. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales and gross profit. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.61, down $0.18 or 23% from last year. 
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America were down 14% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Volumes fell 13% due to the decline in demand for fries outside of the home. However, weekly shipments to large QSR chains, which historically comprise about 1/2 of Global segment sales, improved from around 85% of prior year levels at the end of May to near prior year levels by the end of the first quarter. Weekly shipments to large full-service chains, which historically comprised about 10% of global sales, improved from 45% to 50% in May to 70% to 80% by the end of the first quarter, as governments relaxed restrictions on on-premise dining and as restaurants improved carryout and delivery capabilities. 
International sales, which historically comprise about 40% of segment sales, were mixed. As Tom noted, monthly shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter as demand steadily improved.  Monthly shipment trends in other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America were uneven. This mirrored pattern in demand recovery, but also generally lagged as the rate of customer -- lagged the rate of improvement as customers and distributors in these markets continue to rightsize their inventories. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined $25 million to $78 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for about $9 million of the decline, with the remainder driven by lower sales. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 6% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of the fiscal '20. 
Mix was unfavorable for 2 reasons. First, independent restaurants, which purchased a high amount of Lamb Weston branded products have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And second, some customers have traded down to more value-oriented products in order to reduce costs. It's important to note that this impact was more pronounced in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we've steadily regained much of this business as restaurant traffic improved in recent months. 
Volume declined 28%, reflecting the continued impact that government-imposed restrictions have had on consumer traffic. Our weekly shipments to full-service and small and regional quick-service restaurants, which together have historically compromised (sic) [ comprised ] 3 quarters of the segment sales, improved to 80% to 85% of prior year sales by the end of the first quarter. Our weekly shipments to noncommercial outlets, which have historically compromised (sic) [ comprised ] the other 25% of the segment sales, modestly improved as the quarter progressed, but were soft at about 50% of prior year levels. 
Foodservices product contribution margin declined $17 million to $86 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $4 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, offset by favorable price/mix. 
Sales in our retail segment increased 19% in the quarter. Volume increased 11%, although this masks the performance of our branded portfolio, which historically has compromised (sic) [ comprised ] about 40% of the segment's volume. 
Our brands are winning. Volume growth of our Grown In Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products was up together more than 30% in the quarter. That's well above weekly category volume growth rates, which range between 15% and 25%. However, Retail segment's volume growth was partially offset by decline in private label shipments, which reflects the loss of certain low-margin private label business that largely began during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting that favorable mix of more branded products. Retail product contribution margin increased $7 million to $36 million and was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense. This increase was partially offset by $3 million of pandemic-related costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. That's up $12 million versus last year. Our top priorities in deploying cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent $33 million in CapEx, including for a new ERP system. Given the outlook for the business, cash flow and improved liquidity position, we're increasing our capital expenditures target for the year to $180 million from $140 million, as we invest in productivity and optimization projects as well as some targeted growth capacity. With respect to capital returns, we declared our regular quarterly dividend 2 weeks ago. 
Since the pandemic began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. In September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3 year, $750 million revolver to replace the $500 million facility that was set to expire in November of 2021. The new revolver remains undrawn and fully available. 
In conjunction with the revolver, with more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we chose to prepay the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November 2021. All in, the financing actions we've taken since pandemic began, have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, lowered our weighted average interest rate and stretched our debt amortization, while only increasing our expected annual after tax interest payments by about $11 million. So along with our current -- so along with our ability to continue to generate cash, we feel good about our current liquidity position. 
Now turning to some demand trends that we're seeing in the second quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments have largely stabilized during the latter half of the first quarter and into the first 4 weeks of September. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date in the second quarter are approximately 90% of prior year levels. 
In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. are trending at around 95% of prior year levels. While QSRs are likely to be largely unaffected, we anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants could take a step back as outdoor dining options become more limited with the onset of colder weather. 
In our Foodservice segment, weekly shipments to our full-service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate are trending at approximately 80% of prior year levels. Shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs have been trending above that rate but could soften due to colder weather. Shipments to noncommercial customers have been trending well below that rate and are likely to remain so until the spread of COVID is broadly contained. 
In our Retail segment, weekly shipments are trending even with prior year levels with strong volume growth of our branded products, offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. In Europe, weekly shipments to date in the second quarter by our European joint venture, are approaching prior year levels. Although consumer demand at this time last year was somewhat soft due to high prices and quality concerns as a result of the poor crop. As in the U.S., we believe that shipments to full-service restaurants in Europe may also begin to soften as cold weather reduces outdoor dining options. 
Shipment trends in our other international markets are mixed. In China and Australia, shipments are approaching prior year levels. In other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America, demand has improved since the end of the first quarter, although our shipments continue to generally lag demand improvements as customers and distributors continue to rightsize their inventories. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global segments results. 
In short, overall demand across our markets is largely consistent with what we observed during the latter half of the first quarter. Although we remain cautious about the effect of the onset of colder weather on outdoor dining,as well as the continuing spread of the virus in the U.S. and its resurgence in some key international markets. 
In addition, when estimating sales for the quarter, recall that our second quarter results of last year benefited from strong sales of customized products, including limited time offerings as well as from additional shipping days related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
With respect to costs, as we've previously discussed, we plan to process potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We stretched out the old crop in order to manage inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in higher cost as a result of higher raw potato storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize the impact of these higher costs in our second quarter income statement as we sell that inventory over the coming months. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

Let me just quickly sum up by saying it was a solid quarter in the context of the current operating environment, and I'm proud of how our manufacturing, commercial and support teams have continued to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers. We're optimistic about the steady improvement in restaurant traffic and fry demand in most of our markets as well as our ability to control costs and manage through the pandemic's impact on our operations. However, we do expect some choppiness in demand as the world continues to manage through the crisis. We remain confident that Lamb Weston is well positioned to emerge as a strong company once we get to the other side of the pandemic and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.

And the thing we got our eye on is as the weather changes and you have flare-ups in COVID hotspots, we certainly have data where we look at the markets that are potentially put more restrictions on.

And so nothing there. So really, nothing that I would say gets deferred into out years. Now we did mention last call that we had deferred some expansion capital that we were looking at. But again, that's -- we'll reassess that as the market recovers. In terms of freight cost, I've heard others have had challenges with some near-term freight. 
We tend to contract a lot of our trucking as opposed to play a lot in the spot market, where we'd had some freight volatility, maybe more in Q4 is -- early in Q1, as we were trying to catch up those inventories and hot shotting some things our rail, truck freight had some negative impact to it. But that -- we pretty well stabilized. And again, so because we contract the trucking largely, we're not as exposed as maybe some others that you may have heard."

Now we know the absolute number historically. But it's about running production as much as you can in light of the disruptions we're experiencing, and they've gotten a lot better. 
And we're getting -- like I noted in my remarks, we're a lot better at adjusting and moving production around when we have a disruption to service our customers, which also -- there's a cost element to that. So I think as this becomes more stabilized, Bryan, we'll have a better understanding of the overall capacity utilization across the industry.

But I'm just curious if you would be willing to comment on just maybe like if that's a signal of confidence on the overall industry, like structural basis of the industry as we think about even going into calendar '21 because a lot of questions will be asked around utilization now. But for thinking out 12 to 18 months and the large competitor is back building the plant, it seemed to me that the industry is saying, yes, we're trying to get through this, but we also have to be prepared for when demand comes back because the industry overall is structurally impaired at this point."

Now recognize that in our global business unit, those big chain customers we tend on average to have about 1/3 of those contracts come up every year. And those contract structures are different. Some have cost pass-through elements, some have just cost inflation elements and so forth. And so that -- it's fairly variable in terms of how those contracts work.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I hope that you and your families continue to be well. Let me just start off by saying that I feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we are executing as a company. This is a testament to the Lamb Weston team, and I want to thank them for their commitment to each other and our company as well as their continued service to our customers, suppliers and communities. 
As we navigate this challenging environment, our first priority remains ensuring the health and safety of our employees. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have instituted more rigorous operating protocols across the company, especially for our production and frontline teams that work to keep feeding the world while keeping our manufacturing facilities and products safe. 
In some cases, this has created additional burdens for our team members and their families. And I want to thank them for their commitment and understanding. I continue to be inspired by the spirit of teamwork that our employees show every day, and that makes me proud to be a part of this great company. 
In addition to the hard work by our team, our improved financial performance versus our fourth quarter 2020 reflects 2 broad factors. First, the operating environment has steadily recovered over the past few months with restaurant traffic and fry demand improving in North America in most of our key markets. Second, we have gotten better at managing through the disruption that the pandemic has created in our manufacturing operations as well as controlling costs across the business. 
With respect to the operating environment, we are optimistic about the sequential improvement, breadth and pace of recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand. However, we also remain cautious about the uncertainty of the recovery stability with COVID continuing to be a challenge in the U.S. and some key international markets. 
In the U.S., overall restaurant traffic and fry demand steadily improved early in the quarter, then largely stabilized at levels that were below what we saw just before the pandemic. Traffic at large quick service chain restaurants approached prior year levels, especially during the latter half of the quarter by leveraging drive-through, takeout and delivery formats. Full-service restaurant traffic also improved as the quarter progressed, then stabilized at about 75% to 80% of prior year levels as governments relax restriction for on-premise dining, and restaurants lean more on carryout and delivery and outdoor dining to generate sales. 
Traffic and demand at noncommercial customers -- which includes lodging and hospitality, health care, schools and universities, sports and entertainment and workplace environments -- remain at less than 50% of prior year levels for the entire quarter, although it did improve modestly as the quarter progressed. 
 
In retail, demand growth in the quarter was strong. After peaking a more than 50% weekly category volume growth in April and May, weekly volume growth steadily moderated to between 15% and 20% growth by August as restrictions on restaurants eased. 
In Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, fry demand approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. Although it's important to note that demand at this time last year was somewhat soft for us due to a poor potato crop. 
Demand improvement in our other key international markets was mixed. In China and Australia, demand steadily improved and approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter. In our other key markets in Asia and Latin America, the improvement in demand was uneven as governments employed differing approaches to contain the spread of the virus. In short, demand steadily improved in the U.S. and across most of our international markets as summer progressed, then stabilized below pre-pandemic levels. Along with that steady recovery in demand, our teams leveraged lessons learned when COVID first hit and have adapted our operations to better manage through the current environment. 
As I noted earlier, since the onset of the pandemic, we've stepped up our employee safety and sanitation protocols at each of our manufacturing, commercial and support locations, which has resulted in earlier detection of COVID among our workforce. We've also steadily become more efficient in minimizing disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and service levels, including isolating specific areas of our facilities that would be needed to shut down, sanitize and restart after members of our production team are affected by the virus as well as increasing flexibility to adjust production schedules and run times across the network. 
Our supply chain team has been able to significantly reduce our incremental production cost inefficiency as compared to what we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We've also taken a range of steps to aggressively manage our selling, general and administrative expenses, including shutting down all travel and large meetings and deferring other discretionary expenditures and projects. However, one project that we did not defer was implementing Phase 1 of our new enterprise resource planning system as we believe it will be a key enabler to driving efficiencies over the long term. We are currently evaluating options for when to begin implementing Phase 2. 
Before handing the call off to Rob, let me update you on the potato crop and the pricing environment. With respect to the crop, on a preliminary basis, we believe the crop in our growing areas in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Upper Midwest will be consistent with historical averages in the aggregate. Our early read on the European potato crop is that it will also be consistent with historical averages, and that's a welcome sign given the poor crops in recent years. 
As usual, we'll provide our updated view of the crops yield and quality and how we expect the crop to hold up in storage when we report our second quarter results in early January. With respect to contract discussions and pricing, we're largely through the negotiations for the domestic large chain restaurant contracts that are up for renewal this year. And in the aggregate, we have maintained stable pricing in the portfolio. For those contracts yet to be finalized, we'll remain disciplined and take an approach designed to maintain and reinforce our strategic customer relationships. 
Outside of these large chain restaurant contracts, on balance, domestic pricing continues to hold up well. However, we have begun to see increased competitive activity in some domestic market segments as well as more value-oriented product segments in some international markets. As demand continues to strengthen, we expect pricing pressure in these segments will lessen. 
In summary, we feel good about our performance in the quarter and how we're executing as a company. We're optimistic about the positive demand trends in the U.S. and in our key international markets, but we remain cautious due to the continued uncertainty with the current operating environment. We're navigating through the crisis by prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, leveraging our manufacturing footprint and operational agility to make sure we service customers and aggressively controlling costs across the entire company. 
And finally, we're encouraged about the health of this year's crop as well as the overall pricing stability across our portfolio. These are challenging times, which we expect will be around for a while, but we also believe that by focusing on our strategies and our commitment to our employees and servicing our customers we'll emerge as a stronger company. 
Now let me turn the call over to Rob."

As Tom noted, we believe that we weathered the worst of the pandemic's effect on our operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Demand across most restaurant sectors has improved from the lows of Q4, providing a backdrop for us to deliver a 3% sequential sales growth in our first quarter. 
The sequential increase in earnings was more dramatic. We nearly doubled gross profit from $111 million to $214 million, and increased EBITDA, including joint ventures, by more than 2.5x from $78 million to $202 million, as we increased operating leverage, and we greatly improved our ability to control costs and manage through the disruption that pandemic has on our manufacturing network and distribution chain. While our results remain below pre-pandemic levels and down versus prior year, the sequential improvement in the demand environment and our financial performance is encouraging. 
Now turning to our year-over-year results. Net sales declined 12% versus prior year quarter to $872 million. Sales volume was down 14% as frozen potato demand outside the home continue to be affected by government-imposed restrictions on restaurant traffic and other food service operations. However, after realizing some benefit from customers reloading inventories early in the first quarter, our weekly shipment trends in each of our domestic channels and most of our international markets steadily improved as the quarter progressed. I'll discuss this in more detail when reviewing our business segment performance. 
Price/mix increased 2% due to improvements in both the Foodservice and Retail segments. Gross profit declined $35 million with about $16 million due to pandemic related costs on our manufacturing and supply chain operations. That $16 million is down from $47 million of pandemic related production costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Of the $16 million, about $6 million were utilization related costs and inefficiencies arising from disruptions to our manufacturing network. That compares to about $25 million of costs for utilization related costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, these costs largely relate to labor and other costs to shut down, sanitize and restart manufacturing facilities impacted by COVID; costs associated with modifying production schedules and reducing run times across our network to compensate for facilities impacted by COVID; and incremental costs and inefficiencies related to manufacturing retail products on lines primarily designed for foodservice products. 
The other $10 million of the $16 million consists of nonutilization related costs, and included about $3 million of expense to the remaining crop year 2019 raw potato purchase obligations and about $7 million for enhanced employee safety, sanitation protocols as well as for incremental warehousing, transportation and supply chain costs. 
As we previously discussed, we expect to incur utilization and nonutilization related costs and inefficiencies as long as our manufacturing and supply chain operations are impacted by the pandemic. The remaining $19 million decline in gross profit largely reflects lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable price/mix, a $5 million year-over-year change in mark-to-market adjustments and cost efficiency savings. 
SG&A in the quarter was essentially flat. Cost management efforts, including a $3.5 million reduction in advertising and promotional expense offset $1 million of nonrecurring expenses associated with implementing our new ERP system and $4 million of pandemic-related expenses, largely related to net costs of retaining certain sales employees. 
Equity method earnings were $12 million, up $1 million from last year. However, excluding the impact of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings declined $2 million, with half due to pandemic-related costs similar to what we incurred in our base business. While down versus last year, equity earnings increased sequentially as a result of significant decline in pandemic-related costs in the first quarter as well as steady improvements in our weekly shipments by our European joint venture. 
 
EBITDA, including joint ventures, was $202 million down $31 million. About $21 million of the decline was due to pandemic-related costs I've discussed. The remainder of the EBITDA decline was driven by lower sales and gross profit. Diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.61, down $0.18 or 23% from last year. 
Now moving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment, which includes the top 100 U.S.-based QSR and full-service restaurant chains as well as all sales outside of North America were down 14% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% as a result of negative mix. Volumes fell 13% due to the decline in demand for fries outside of the home. However, weekly shipments to large QSR chains, which historically comprise about 1/2 of Global segment sales, improved from around 85% of prior year levels at the end of May to near prior year levels by the end of the first quarter. Weekly shipments to large full-service chains, which historically comprised about 10% of global sales, improved from 45% to 50% in May to 70% to 80% by the end of the first quarter, as governments relaxed restrictions on on-premise dining and as restaurants improved carryout and delivery capabilities. 
International sales, which historically comprise about 40% of segment sales, were mixed. As Tom noted, monthly shipments in China and Australia approached prior year levels by the end of the quarter as demand steadily improved.  Monthly shipment trends in other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America were uneven. This mirrored pattern in demand recovery, but also generally lagged as the rate of customer -- lagged the rate of improvement as customers and distributors in these markets continue to rightsize their inventories. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expense, declined $25 million to $78 million. Pandemic-related costs accounted for about $9 million of the decline, with the remainder driven by lower sales. 
Sales for our Foodservice segment, which services North American Foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American restaurant customers, declined 22% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 6% behind the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in the latter half of the fiscal '20. 
Mix was unfavorable for 2 reasons. First, independent restaurants, which purchased a high amount of Lamb Weston branded products have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. And second, some customers have traded down to more value-oriented products in order to reduce costs. It's important to note that this impact was more pronounced in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we've steadily regained much of this business as restaurant traffic improved in recent months. 
Volume declined 28%, reflecting the continued impact that government-imposed restrictions have had on consumer traffic. Our weekly shipments to full-service and small and regional quick-service restaurants, which together have historically compromised (sic) [ comprised ] 3 quarters of the segment sales, improved to 80% to 85% of prior year sales by the end of the first quarter. Our weekly shipments to noncommercial outlets, which have historically compromised (sic) [ comprised ] the other 25% of the segment sales, modestly improved as the quarter progressed, but were soft at about 50% of prior year levels. 
Foodservices product contribution margin declined $17 million to $86 million, with pandemic-related costs accounting for $4 million of the decline. The remainder was primarily driven by lower sales, offset by favorable price/mix. 
Sales in our retail segment increased 19% in the quarter. Volume increased 11%, although this masks the performance of our branded portfolio, which historically has compromised (sic) [ comprised ] about 40% of the segment's volume. 
Our brands are winning. Volume growth of our Grown In Idaho, Alexia, and licensed brand products was up together more than 30% in the quarter. That's well above weekly category volume growth rates, which range between 15% and 25%. However, Retail segment's volume growth was partially offset by decline in private label shipments, which reflects the loss of certain low-margin private label business that largely began during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting that favorable mix of more branded products. Retail product contribution margin increased $7 million to $36 million and was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable mix and lower A&P expense. This increase was partially offset by $3 million of pandemic-related costs. 
Moving to our cash flow and liquidity position. In the first quarter, we generated more than $250 million of cash from operations. That's up $12 million versus last year. Our top priorities in deploying cash continue to be investing to grow the business and returning cash to shareholders. In the quarter, we spent $33 million in CapEx, including for a new ERP system. Given the outlook for the business, cash flow and improved liquidity position, we're increasing our capital expenditures target for the year to $180 million from $140 million, as we invest in productivity and optimization projects as well as some targeted growth capacity. With respect to capital returns, we declared our regular quarterly dividend 2 weeks ago. 
Since the pandemic began, we've taken steps to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our financial position by entering into a new $325 million term loan and completing a $500 million note offering. In September, we amended our credit agreement to put in place a new 3 year, $750 million revolver to replace the $500 million facility that was set to expire in November of 2021. The new revolver remains undrawn and fully available. 
In conjunction with the revolver, with more than $1 billion of cash on hand, we chose to prepay the approximately $270 million outstanding balance on the term loan that was due in November 2021. All in, the financing actions we've taken since pandemic began, have increased our liquidity by nearly $1 billion, lowered our weighted average interest rate and stretched our debt amortization, while only increasing our expected annual after tax interest payments by about $11 million. So along with our current -- so along with our ability to continue to generate cash, we feel good about our current liquidity position. 
Now turning to some demand trends that we're seeing in the second quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the aggregate, the demand environment and our weekly shipments have largely stabilized during the latter half of the first quarter and into the first 4 weeks of September. Specifically, in the U.S., shipments to date in the second quarter are approximately 90% of prior year levels. 
In our Global segment, weekly shipments to our large QSR and full-service chain restaurant customers in the U.S. are trending at around 95% of prior year levels. While QSRs are likely to be largely unaffected, we anticipate that shipments to full-service restaurants could take a step back as outdoor dining options become more limited with the onset of colder weather. 
In our Foodservice segment, weekly shipments to our full-service restaurants, regional and small QSRs and noncommercial customers in aggregate are trending at approximately 80% of prior year levels. Shipments to full-service restaurants and small and regional QSRs have been trending above that rate but could soften due to colder weather. Shipments to noncommercial customers have been trending well below that rate and are likely to remain so until the spread of COVID is broadly contained. 
In our Retail segment, weekly shipments are trending even with prior year levels with strong volume growth of our branded products, offset by a decline in shipments of private label products. In Europe, weekly shipments to date in the second quarter by our European joint venture, are approaching prior year levels. Although consumer demand at this time last year was somewhat soft due to high prices and quality concerns as a result of the poor crop. As in the U.S., we believe that shipments to full-service restaurants in Europe may also begin to soften as cold weather reduces outdoor dining options. 
Shipment trends in our other international markets are mixed. In China and Australia, shipments are approaching prior year levels. In other markets in Asia Pacific and Latin America, demand has improved since the end of the first quarter, although our shipments continue to generally lag demand improvements as customers and distributors continue to rightsize their inventories. As a reminder, all of our international sales are included as part of our global segments results. 
In short, overall demand across our markets is largely consistent with what we observed during the latter half of the first quarter. Although we remain cautious about the effect of the onset of colder weather on outdoor dining as well as the continuing spread of the virus in the U.S. and its resurgence in some key international markets. 
In addition, when estimating sales for the quarter, recall that our second quarter results of last year benefited from strong sales of customized products, including limited time offerings as well as from additional shipping days related to the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
With respect to costs, as we've previously discussed, we plan to process potatoes from the 2019 crop through early September, which is a couple of months longer than usual. We stretched out the old crop in order to manage inventories in light of the pandemic's impact on fry demand. Processing older crop results in higher cost as a result of higher raw potato storage fees and lower recovery rates. Since we typically carry upwards of 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize the impact of these higher costs in our second quarter income statement as we sell that inventory over the coming months. 
Now here's Tom for some closing comments."

Let me just quickly sum up by saying it was a solid quarter in the context of the current operating environment, and I'm proud of how our manufacturing, commercial and support teams have continued to focus on the right strategic and operating priorities to serve our customers. We're optimistic about the steady improvement in restaurant traffic and fry demand in most of our markets as well as our ability to control costs and manage through the pandemic's impact on our operations. However, we do expect some choppiness in demand as the world continues to manage through the crisis.

The pricing pressure is on the lower -- the lower line flow type items that we characterize as nonvalue added. So we play in that a little bit in a lot of these markets.

And so I think as I think about where we're at today in terms of demand, it's been pretty stable at the levels that we talked to in the script. And the thing we got our eye on is as the weather changes and you have flare-ups in COVID hotspots, we certainly have data where we look at the markets that are potentially put more restrictions on. We're watching those ordering patterns very closely. So those are a couple of things that -- why we continue to remain cautious about. We just got to work through it, and it will actualize itself over the next 90 days, but we're watching it carefully."

In terms of deferring costs, I mean, those inefficiency costs and the COVID costs and so forth, those are flowing straight through the inventory. Now if you're asking about are we deferring any maintenance costs or things like that that might bite us in future years -- none of that; we continue to maintain our facilities as we normally do. And so nothing there. So really, nothing that I would say gets deferred into out years. Now we did mention last call that we had deferred some expansion capital that we were looking at. But again, that's -- we'll reassess that as the market recovers. In terms of freight cost, I've heard others have had challenges with some near-term freight. 
We tend to contract a lot of our trucking as opposed to play a lot in the spot market, where we'd had some freight volatility, maybe more in Q4 is -- early in Q1, as we were trying to catch up those inventories and hot shotting some things our rail, truck freight had some negative impact to it. But that -- we pretty well stabilized. And again, so because we contract the trucking largely, we're not as exposed as maybe some others that you may have heard."

Bryan, I -- I'm not going to get into a specific number on utilization rate because it's really a moving target right now. And we -- if you think about Lamb Weston, obviously, our utilization rate is below where we've historically operated. But on top of that, we -- as we have shutdowns and startups over the past -- since the pandemic started, it really muddies the waters on what your overall capacity is. Now we know the absolute number historically. But it's about running production as much as you can in light of the disruptions we're experiencing, and they've gotten a lot better. 
And we're getting -- like I noted in my remarks, we're a lot better at adjusting and moving production around when we have a disruption to service our customers, which also -- there's a cost element to that. So I think as this becomes more stabilized, Bryan, we'll have a better understanding of the overall capacity utilization across the industry. And the competitive set is experiencing some of the same things that we are. So it's a bit of a moving target right now."
