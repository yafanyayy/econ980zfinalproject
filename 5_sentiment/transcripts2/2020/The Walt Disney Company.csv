But before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the coronavirus. Certainly, our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. 
Turning to the quarter. Since our last call, our studio released 2 more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global box office. Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the 9 episodes SkyWalker Saga; and Frozen 2, which became the highest grossing animated movie of all-time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global box office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+ and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window. 
On the park side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction, Star Wars: Rise of the resistance Which opened in Orlando in early December and in Anaheim, just a few weeks ago. Our imagineers and the design team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious and technologically-advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. Of course, the high point of the quarter was a highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform, the launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful, exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1. And we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at Disney+.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free-to-pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface and the high-quality of our brands and content. In fact, we're seeing the 4 quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. 
On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen; Disney Channel Series by Hannah Montana and the Suite Life of Zach and Cody; recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available and our growing slate of original content is also a great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian, which has quickly become a bona fide hit in a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there's great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months. 
We'll continue to add high-quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2 and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring 3 original new Marvel series for Disney+: Loki; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August; and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with events from these new shows, will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated Return of the Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and NatGeo. So there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+'s roster of extraordinary talent. 
The next big priority is watching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we'll launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Additional markets, including Belgium, the Nordics and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal+, the leading pay TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. 
We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29 at the beginning of the Indian Premier League Cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar, VIP and premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. 
Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN+. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC and the recent MacGregor-Tyrone fight brought in about 1 million pay-per-view purchases and 0.5 million new subscribers. And we'll continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. 
At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrate it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs. And as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers and no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX's exceptional content to a broader audience while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there's tremendous appetite for our content and the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay-TV subscribers, and that includes Medpulse Young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX's programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high-quality programming for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. 
It's often challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction, particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models. But since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer and International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, I'm more confident than ever in that decision. I'm enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we're now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions."

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And a",1529,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to date. 
In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our studio's creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth in worldwide theatrical and higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. Theatrical results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV/SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business as operating income from TV/SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at consumer products and at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international parks and resorts. Consumer products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic parks and experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and, to a lesser extent, increases in attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. Operating income at domestic parks and experiences was up 6% as the flow-through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% in the first quarter, and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. 
At our International operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland's results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the ongoing coronavirus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance at occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for 2 months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these 2 factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for 2 months. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both cable and broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases for NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership, primarily for NBA and college football regular season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership for Monday Night Football. I'll note that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. 
At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filing, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher during Q1 last year and no comparable sales in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC network. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which was aided by about a 2.5 point benefit from the launch of the ACC network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment increased in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and higher programming costs at ESPN+. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF International cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. 
As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S. with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including Episodic Series from Marvel and Season 2 of the Mandalorian. 
Turning to the Elimination segment. Revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1. And driven primarily by the intersegment content sales from Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of intersegment content transactions reflected in our segment results. 
Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive impact to total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share. And we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

That",420,"Well, I don't know if you call it a surprise, but certainly, it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there's been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything, including original shorts and older shorts and legacy Disney channel shows, and of course, the library, led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian. But it has been very broad-based. And I mentioned earlier that about -- it was 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian watch at least 10 other things on the service. So this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a for instance. So with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes, obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short-form and long form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched, we haven't really changed it that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by the Mandalorian have worked. And we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming and that it would build over time. So as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume of the product that we're creating and don't really feel that there's much that we have to adjust to right now. We have, just as a for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have 3 Marvel series that were announced and I think there are 7 other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or preproduction. There are a number of Disney Originals. We have Disney original movies coming, very pleased with them. By the way, I know we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, as a for instance. So we've got, I think, a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust. And I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working.

And we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches and the marketing and the creation of product for those and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say, probably in 2021. Internationally, that is, after the Disney+ launch. On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggests that while there's a lot of disruption, there's a fair amount of erosion, and you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks, the live sports has held up really well led, of course, by the NFL. So our interest in the NFL remains very strong, and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail."

They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So I don't really think that, that we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S., except to make sure, obviously, that the programs adopt in the local language properly and in high-quality and secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local tastes. One of the interesting things, by the way, about Star Wars and The Mandalorian, because there's been some  things written after the Rise of Skywalker, the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where that star Wars in certain international market has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they turned into or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone on in the past that was not familiar to them, and they didn't really want to get on board in late. That's not true with Mandalorian because Mandalorian is -- even though it's based on obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters and places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting, the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. And the other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney brand has actually risen nicely thanks to Disney+, particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the matter of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our traditional linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. India, we're going to launch -- bundled with Hotstar -- directly bundled, meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point but expect that there'll be 2 primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library plus original programming. And the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Price for the market and launched at a very peak period of time for the IPL, the Cricket League. And so we think it's an opportune moment. We take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances."

The fact that the ARPU by the end of the quarter was $5.56 on a $6.99 subscription suggests that while there are discounts in the market and the packaging that existed, enables consumers to buy in at lower prices. We did extremely well, basically with a direct-to-consumer package and ARPU that was higher. And so the 26 5 in subscribers came roughly 50% directly through Disney+.com. For instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others. But a lot of those subscribers, well, many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a 3-year. Many of them bought basically the month for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services that is driving the app, including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of basically routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now what's to understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands and Canada with this. And so these are mostly domestic subs. But I think it's all a very positive story in terms of the the manner in which people bought this, and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted was that bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be, and much better than we had estimated they would be before we launch. And I think, again, that's the result of -- it starts with the product. And I think the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, ease of navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point, which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad -- on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, looking at $11 billion plus box office year from the Disney Studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away. But as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate, I could name a number of titles. With this year, for instance, we have 2 Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney-branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have, obviously, Marvel with Black Widow initial at first and then internally, the rest of the end of the year. And you can imagine a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, where, as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of the theatrical release. We finished the 9 episode SkyWalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with the Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October and then more coming from the Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then we have a prequel to Rogue One and an Obi Wan series also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short-term is going to be, I'll call it, television for Disney+ and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio but we still expect a very strong year. And given the franchises and the talent that we both work with and have working for us, we're confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product, both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way."

The 60 million to 90 million included, obviously, 2/3 of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States where, except for just a few markets, we've not even launched yet. So it's far too early for us after basically a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not in any way pour cold  water on them because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working, the interest in streaming in general in those markets isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world, so we have probably more of a marketing effort. And I'd say more of a challenge to launch in those markets. Not that those markets haven't been already seated with streaming. We know Netflix has done extremely well internationally. But we're just beginning there. And I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math, that suggests that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year 5, just after a very short period of time. And I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both or the price. This is just, I think, a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just look over them one more time. Those brands are extreme -- not only the high quality. It is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition that is obviously more competition coming into the space. But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product, because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated. We're extremely well-priced and we created a service from a technical basis and a user interface basis that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our -- as we look ahead at that guidance, I can't say that we won't change it at some point. But it's -- we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point.  And we have a long way to go."

That's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is the number of times people stream per week since launch, and we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly basis per subscriber. And I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all 3 cases, recency, the percentage of people that weekly active users very, very high. The same thing is true with frequency, the number of average days that they actually use the service. And again, this is something that we've seen over both -- basically the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28. That's also very high in the engagement. And when you're looking at multiple hours a week stream per subscriber. I can give you that. Now that's in the 6 to 7 hours a week range. Very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off. That may have actually skewed that a little bit high. But again, we're seeing across the -- and some done extremely well. As, for instance, including their shorts, musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service, Toy Story 4 just came on, Rise of Skywalker later in the year. Lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned, Endgame. It's kind of -- I guess, without, in any way, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of this product is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have hte -- the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high. That's why they decided to launch there. South Korea is very high, but there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities -- huge opportunities for us internationally, and that's where that Disney name and the family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well."

I'm not -- just wondering how you think about the growth function for parts. It's a question we get from investors all the time. It's super important. Would love if you just share your thoughts because I think what investors look at is so much of revenue and income growth has come from increased spend per guest in the form of either pricing or merchandise and food volumes. The question we wrestle with is, geez, how long can that keep going, right? Is there some point at which either your consumer gets priced out or just competition sets in or that sort of thing and elasticity sets in. So without asking for formal guidance, I just love is there still more opportunity on the yield side? Or how long can you push that? Are there other ways that parts can grow over time?"

And but the ad-supported part of the equation makes the ARPU come out even higher than the ad-free. Most of the subscribers subscribe to the ad-supported. So that's a good balance of the ARPUs when you stack them up next to each other. Let me take the domestic part question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets because of the disruption in those economies had lower visitation. The 2 I would cite would be -- that won't be a surprise to anyone would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. The -- in -- when you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even back into the top 5 and the top 1 being the U.K., which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina that is for the East Coast Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then we also have Mexico, Australia, and the only market that even breaks into the top 5 would be Japan in -- and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland. And so far, there's been no evidence that there's any impact on the intent to visit or people fulfilling reservations or commitments from coronavirus."

We continue to invest capital to build out new attractions, new hotels, new restaurants, we've announced many different projects.

We have a variety of different model projects underway, the Avengers project in California. And a number of Marvel-related things in Florida, including Guardians of the Galaxy e-ticket attraction. So we're going to continue to build out against the company's most popular -- or using the most popular franchises. And as I mentioned, build out hotels as well. We just opened 1 Riviera Resort. We're opening one in Florida. We have Star-Wars-themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We'll look for international opportunities as well. They still exist. And obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes, that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly, there's a yield story to tell, and that's been exceptional. That is a combination of things, but clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot, taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the park more accessible in non-peak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices."

But before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the coronavirus. Certainly, our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. 
Turning to the quarter. Since our last call, our studio released 2 more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global box office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the 9 episodes Skywalker Saga; and Frozen 2, which became the highest grossing animated movie of all-time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global box office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+ and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window.
On the park side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December and in Anaheim, just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the design team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
Of course, the high point of the quarter was a highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform, the launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful, exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1. And we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free-to-pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface and the high-quality of our brands and content. In fact, we're seeing the 4 quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. 
On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen; Disney Channel series by Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zach & Cody; recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also a great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian, which has quickly become a bona fide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there's great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months.
We'll continue to add high-quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2 and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring 3 original new Marvel series for Disney+: Loki; the Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August; and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with events from these new shows, will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Nat Geo. So there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+'s roster of extraordinary talent. 
The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we'll launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Additional markets, including Belgium, the Nordics and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal +, the leading pay TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. 
We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29 at the beginning of the Indian Premier League cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. 
Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN+. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC. And the recent McGregor-Tyron fight brought in about 1 million pay-per-view purchases and 0.5 million new subscribers. And we'll continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. 
At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrate it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs. And as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. 
During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX's exceptional content to a broader audience while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there's tremendous appetite for our content. And the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of who is young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX's programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high-quality programming for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. 
It's often challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction, particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models. But since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, I'm more confident than ever in that decision. I'm enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we're now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions."
191564,650348235,1899597,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2020",2020-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And a",1526,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to date. 
In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our studio's creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth in worldwide theatrical and higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. Theatrical results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV/SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business as operating income from TV/SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at consumer products and at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international parks and resorts. Consumer products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic parks and experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and, to a lesser extent, increases in attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. Operating income at domestic parks and experiences was up 6% as the flow-through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% in the first quarter, and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. 
At our International operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland's results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the ongoing coronavirus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance at occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for 2 months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these 2 factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for 2 months. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both cable and broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases for NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership, primarily for NBA and College Football regular season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership for Monday Night Football. I'll note that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. 
At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance, which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filing, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which was aided by about a 2.5-point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment increased in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and higher programming costs at ESPN+. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF International cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. 
As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S. with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including Episodic Series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. 
Turning to the Elimination segment. Revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the intersegment content sales from Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of intersegment content transactions reflected in our segment results.
Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive impact to total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share. And we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

That",425,"Well, I don't know if you call it a surprise, but certainly, it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there's been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything, including original shorts and older shorts and legacy Disney Channel shows, and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian but it has been very broad-based. And I mentioned earlier that about -- it was -- 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian watch at least 10 other things on the service. So this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a for instance. So with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes, obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short form and long form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched, we haven't really changed it that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by The Mandalorian have worked. And we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming and that it would build over time. So as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of product that we're creating and don't really feel that there's much that we have to adjust to right now. We have -- just as a for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the 3 Marvel series that were announced and I think there are 7 other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or preproduction. There are a number of Disney Originals. We have Disney original movies coming, very pleased with them, by the way. And then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, as a for instance. So we've got, I think, a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust. And I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working.
So second part of the question?"

We are launching, as I mentioned on the call, across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March and then in India, on March 29, and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021, including Latin America. And we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches and the marketing and the creation of product for those and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say, probably in 2021, internationally, that is, after the Disney+ launch. 
On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggests that while there's a lot of disruption, there's a fair amount of erosion. And you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well led, of course, by the NFL. So our interest in the NFL remains very strong, and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail."

So I don't really think that we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S., except to make sure, obviously, that the programs adopted the local language properly and in high quality and secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local tastes. One of the interesting things, by the way, about Star Wars and The Mandalorian because there's been some things written after the Rise of Skywalker that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where that Star Wars in certain international market has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone on in the past that was not familiar to them, and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian because Mandalorian is -- even though it's based on obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters and places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting that the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. 
And the other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney brand has actually risen nicely thanks to Disney+, particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our traditional linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. 
India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar, directly bundled, meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point but expect that there will be 2 primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library plus original programming. And the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Price for the market and launched at a very peak period of time for the IPL, the Cricket League. And so we think it's an opportune moment. We take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances."

And so the 26.5 million in subscribers came roughly 50% directly through disneyplus.com. For instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others. But a lot of those subscribers, well, many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a 3-year. Many of them bought basically the month for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services distributing the app, including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of basically routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands and Canada with this, and so these are mostly domestic subs. But I think that it's all a very positive story in terms of the manner in which people bought this, and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said on -- in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be, and much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of -- it starts with the product. And I think the end -- the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the ease of navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point, which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad -- on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, looking at $11 billion plus box office year from the Disney Studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away. But as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have 2 Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney-branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have, obviously, Marvel with Black Widow initial -- at first and then -- the rest -- the end of the year. And you can imagine a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, where as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of the theatrical release. We finished the 9-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then we have a prequel to Rogue One and an Obi-Wan series also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short term is going to be, I'll call it, television for Disney+ and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio but we still expect a very strong year. And given the franchises and the talent that we both work with and have working for us, we're confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product, both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way."

Because of all this, we're halfway to the goal and the model -- the metrics seem to be hitting. Can we expect the profitability to come in sooner than the '24 number? And then if we can just focus on the U.S., I think you guys gave guidance for 20 million to 30 million subs in the U.S. And again, you're sort of at the high end -- or around the high end of that guidance.

The 60 million to 90 million included, obviously, 2/3 of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States where, except for just a few markets, we've not even launched yet. So it's far too early for us after basically a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not to, in any way, pour cold water on them because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working, the interest in streaming in general in those markets isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world, so we have probably more of a marketing effort. And I'd say more of a challenge to launch in those markets. Not that those markets haven't been already seated with streaming. We know Netflix has done extremely well internationally. But we're just beginning there. And I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math, that suggests that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year 5, just after a very short period of time. And I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both or the price. This is just, I think, a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just look over them one more time. Those brands are extreme -- not only are they high quality. It is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition. There's obviously more competition coming into the space. But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated. We're extremely well-priced, and we created a service from a technical basis and a user interface basis that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our -- as we look ahead at that guidance, I can't say that we won't change it at some point. But it's -- we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point. And we have a long way to go."

And any sort of issues or thoughts around consumption levels after the initial sign-up period as sort of people come in and use the service a bunch and then starts to fade after that? Or did you find that it stayed relatively level? And I am interested, Bob, you talked a lot about India, but I'm interested about the launch in Europe broadly and contrasting it with the first series of markets. So is the content that's available on the service in the U.S., also sort of the same content available in Europe? And any sort of differences or nuances in go-to-market, marketing and distribution effort in any of those countries that we should be aware of as we try to gauge how successful Europe might be?"

That's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is the number of times people stream per week since launch. And we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly basis per subscriber. And I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all 3 cases, recency, the percentage of people that are weekly active users are very, very high; the same thing is true with frequency, the number of average days that they actually use the service. And again, this is something that we've seen over both -- for basically the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28. That's also very high in the engagement. And when you're looking at multiple hours a week stream per subscriber. I can give you that. Now that's in the 6 to 7 hours a week range. Very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off. That may have actually skewed that a little bit high. But again, we're seeing consumption, I'll call it, across the board. And some of it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as a for instance, including their shorts. Musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service, Toy Story 4 just came on, Rise of Skywalker later in the year, lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned, Endgame. It's kind of -- I guess -- and without, in any way, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of this product is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have -- the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high that's why they decided to launch there. South Korea is very high, but there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities, huge opportunities for us internationally, and that's where that Disney name and the family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well."

We'd love it if you just share your thoughts because I think what investors look at is so much of revenue and income growth has come from increased spend per guest in the form of either pricing or merchandise and food volumes. The question we wrestle with is, geez, how long can that keep going, right? Is there some point at which either your consumer gets priced out or just competition sets in or that sort of thing and elasticity sets in.

Let me take the domestic part question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets because of the disruption in those economies have -- had lower visitation. The 2 I would cite would be -- that won't be a surprise to anyone would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. The -- in -- when you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even back into the top 5 and the top 1 being the U.K., which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina that is for the East Coast Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then we also have Mexico, Australia. And the only market that even breaks into the top 5 would be Japan in -- and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland.

We continue to invest capital to build out new attractions, new hotels, new restaurants, we've announced many different projects.

We have a variety of different model projects underway, the Avengers project in California and a number of Marvel-related things in Florida, including Guardians of the Galaxy e-ticket attraction. So we're going to continue to build out against the company's most popular -- or using the most popular franchises. And as I mentioned, build out hotels as well. We just opened one Riviera Resort. We're opening one in Florida. We have Star-Wars-themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We'll look for international opportunities as well. They still exist. And obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes, that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly, there's a yield story to tell, and that's been exceptional. That is a combination of things, but clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot, taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the park more accessible in nonpeak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices."

But before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the coronavirus. Certainly, our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. 
Turning to the quarter. Since our last call, our studio released 2 more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global box office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the 9 episodes Skywalker Saga; and Frozen 2, which became the highest grossing animated movie of all-time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global box office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+ and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window.
On the park side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December and in Anaheim, just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the design team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
Of course, the high point of the quarter was a highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform. The launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful, exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1. And we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free-to-pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface and the high-quality of our brands and content. In fact, we're seeing the 4 quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. 
On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen; Disney Channel series by Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zach & Cody; recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also a great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian, which has quickly become a bona fide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there's great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months.
We'll continue to add high-quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2 and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring 3 original new Marvel series for Disney+: Loki; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August; and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with events from these new shows, will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Nat Geo. So there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+'s roster of extraordinary talent. 
The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we'll launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Additional markets, including Belgium, the Nordics and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal +, the leading pay TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. 
We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29 at the beginning of the Indian Premier League cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. 
Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN+. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC. And the recent McGregor-Tyron fight brought in about 1 million pay-per-view purchases and 0.5 million new subscribers. And we'll continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. 
At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrate it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs. And as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. 
During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX's exceptional content to a broader audience while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there's tremendous appetite for our content. And the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of who is young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX's programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high-quality programming for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. 
It's often challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction, particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models. But since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, I'm more confident than ever in that decision. I'm enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we're now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions."
191564,650348235,1903444,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2020",2020-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53.

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to date. 
In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our studio's creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth in worldwide theatrical and higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. Theatrical results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV/SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business as operating income from TV/SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at consumer products and at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international parks and resorts. Consumer products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic parks and experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and, to a lesser extent, increases in attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. Operating income at domestic parks and experiences was up 6% as the flow-through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% in the first quarter, and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. 
At our International operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland's results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the ongoing coronavirus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance at occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for 2 months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these 2 factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for 2 months. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both cable and broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases for NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership, primarily for NBA and College Football regular season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership for Monday Night Football. I'll note that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. 
At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance, which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filing, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which was aided by about a 2.5-point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment increased in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and higher programming costs at ESPN+. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF International cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. 
As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S. with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including Episodic Series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. 
Turning to the Elimination segment. Revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the intersegment content sales from Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of intersegment content transactions reflected in our segment results.
Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive impact to total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share. And we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

That",425,"Well, I don't know if you call it a surprise, but certainly, it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there's been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything, including original shorts and older shorts and legacy Disney Channel shows, and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian but it has been very broad-based. And I mentioned earlier that about -- it was -- 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian, watch at least 10 other things on the service. So this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a for instance. So with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes, obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short form and long form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched, we haven't really changed it that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by The Mandalorian have worked. And we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming and that it would build over time. So as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of product that we're creating and don't really feel that there's much that we have to adjust to right now. We have -- just as a for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the 3 Marvel series that were announced and I think there are 7 other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or preproduction. There are a number of Disney Originals. We have Disney original movies coming, very pleased with them, by the way. And then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, as a for instance. So we've got, I think, a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust. And I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working.

We actually have a lot of specifics around it. But we've decided that the priority needs to be Disney+. We are launching, as I mentioned on the call, across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March and then in India, on March 29, and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021, including Latin America. And we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches and the marketing and the creation of product for those and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say, probably in 2021, internationally, that is, after the Disney+ launch. 
On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggests that while there's a lot of disruption, there's a fair amount of erosion. And you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well led, of course, by the NFL. So our interest in the NFL remains very strong, and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail."

191564,650348235,1903444,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2020",2020-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which maybe what you're alluding to, Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world,",590,"Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which maybe what you're alluding to, Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have -- there's brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So I don't really think that we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S., except to make sure, obviously, that the programs adopted the local language properly and in high quality and secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local tastes. One of the interesting things, by the way, about Star Wars and The Mandalorian because there's been some things written after the Rise of Skywalker that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where that Star Wars in certain international market has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone on in the past that was not familiar to them, and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian because Mandalorian is -- even though it's based on obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters and places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting, the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. 
And the other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney brand has actually risen nicely, thanks to Disney+, particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our traditional linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. 
India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar, directly bundled, meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point but expect that there will be 2 primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library plus original programming. And the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Price for the market and launched at a very peak period of time for the IPL, the Cricket League. And so we think it's an opportune moment. We take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances."

We did extremely well, basically with a direct-to-consumer package and ARPU that was higher. And so the 26.5 million in subscribers came roughly 50% directly through disneyplus.com. For instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others, but a lot of those subscribers, well, many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a 3-year. Many of them bought basically the month for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services that is distributing the app and including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of basically routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now I also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands and Canada with this, and so these are mostly domestic subs. But I think that it's all a very positive story in terms of the manner in which people bought this, and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said on -- in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be, and much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of -- it starts with the product. And I think the end -- the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the ease of navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point, which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, looking at $11 billion plus box office year from the Disney Studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away. But as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have 2 Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney-branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have, obviously, Marvel with Black Widow initial -- at first and then the -- the rest -- at the end of the year. And you can imagine a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, where as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of the theatrical release. We finished the 9-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then we have a prequel to Rogue One and an Obi-Wan series also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short term is going to be, I'll call it, television for Disney+ and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio but we still expect a very strong year. And given the franchises and the talent that we both work with and have working for us, we're confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product, both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way."

First of all, on Disney+, the model definitely seems to be holding up. You talked about ARPU churn, content spend, the target is for 60 million to 90 million subs in '24 in profitability. Because of all this, we're halfway to the goal and the model -- the metrics seem to be hitting. Can we expect the profitability to come in sooner than the '24 number? And then if we can just focus on the U.S., I think you guys gave guidance for 20 million to 30 million subs in the U.S. And again, you're sort of at the high end -- or around the high end of that guidance. What are you seeing in terms of the TAM? Are you just -- is the TAM bigger than you thought? And could that potentially be the case in the rest of the world? Or are you just penetrating the market faster than you thought?"

The 60 million to 90 million included, obviously, 2/3 of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States where, except for just a few markets, we've not even launched yet. So it's far too early for us after basically a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not to, in any way, pour cold water on them because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working, the interest in streaming in general in those markets isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world. So we have probably more of a marketing effort. And I'd say more of a challenge to launch in those markets, not that those markets haven't been already seated with streaming. We know Netflix has done extremely well internationally. But we're just beginning there. And I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math, that suggests that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year 5, just after a very short period of time. And I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both or the price, this is just, I think, a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just look over them one more time. Those brands are extreme -- not only are they high quality, it is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition. There's obviously more competition coming into the space. But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated. We're extremely well-priced, and we created a service from a technical basis and a user interface basis that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our -- as we look ahead at that guidance, I can't say that we won't change it at some point. But it's -- we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point. And we have a long way to go."

So is the content that's available on the service in the U.S., also sort of the same content available in Europe?

That's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is the number of times people stream per week since launch. And we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly basis per subscriber. And I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all 3 cases, recency, the percentage of people that are weekly active users are very, very high; the same thing is true with frequency, the number of average days that they actually use the service. And again, this is something that we've seen over both -- for basically the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28. That's also very high in the engagement. And when you're looking at multiple hours a week stream per subscriber. I can give you that. Now that's in the 6 to 7 hours a week range. Very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off, that may have actually skewed that a little bit high. But again, we're seeing consumption, I'll call it, across the board. And some of it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as, for instance, including their shorts. Musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service, Toy Story 4 just came on, Rise of Skywalker later in the year, lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned, Endgame. It's kind of, I guess -- without, in any way, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of this product is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have -- the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high that's why they decided to launch there. South Korea is very high, but there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities for us internationally, and that's where that Disney name and the family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well."

Let me take the domestic part question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets because of the disruption in those economies have -- had lower visitation. The 2 I would cite would be -- that won't be a surprise to anyone, would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. The -- in -- when you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even back into the top 5 and the top 1 being the U.K., which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina that is for the East Coast Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise, just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then we also have Mexico, Australia. And the only market that even breaks into the top 5 would be Japan in -- and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland.

We're opening one in Florida. We have Star-Wars-themed hotel coming, a lot of activity there. We'll look for international opportunities as well. They still exist. And obviously, the virus has slowed things down a bit, but we expect that when that passes, that we will start looking expansively in other territories. And of course, lastly, there's a yield story to tell, and that's been exceptional. That is a combination of things, but clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot, taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the park more accessible in nonpeak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices."

That is an incredibly hard -- 7 movies over, sorry about that, 7 movies over $1 billion, that's an incredibly hard comp on a year-over-year. So we will still -- we still believe that our studio will be very successful this year. And we have confidence in their content resonating with consumers on a global basis. Bob already mentioned some of the big movies that we have coming out, and we feel really good about those. As it relates to transfer pricing of content, the studio definitely will benefit from the content sales to DTCI, the pay one windows, and we had quite a few movies come out in fiscal '19 that will make it into the pay one window in fiscal '20, and that will also have a positive impact on the studio."

But before I talk about the quarter, let me begin with the events in Asia related to the coronavirus. Certainly, our hearts go out to all those affected by this devastating outbreak, including the thousands of people who work for us in the region. In line with numerous prevention efforts taking place across China, we've temporarily closed our parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and we will continue to closely monitor this public health crisis. Christine will have details about the developing financial impact in her comments. 
Turning to the quarter. Since our last call, our studio released 2 more films that exceeded $1 billion each at the global box office. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which concluded the 9 episodes Skywalker Saga; and Frozen 2, which became the highest grossing animated movie of all-time with more than $1.4 billion in global sales, surpassing the original Frozen, which held the record since 2014. The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, along with Captain Marvel, Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story 4 and the biggest movie of all time, Avengers: Endgame contributed to a total global box office for the year for Disney of more than $11 billion, shattering the previous industry record of $7.6 billion set by us in 2016. Many of these films are already available exclusively on Disney+ and the remainder will soon join the service following their home entertainment window.
On the park side, we're thrilled by the overwhelming response to our newest attraction, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, which opened in Orlando in early December and in Anaheim, just a few weeks ago. Our Imagineers and the design team at Lucasfilm did an absolutely phenomenal job, and it's one of the most immersive, ambitious and technologically advanced attractions ever created for a Disney park, and it's elevating storytelling to exciting new levels. Not surprising, Rise of the Resistance has quickly become a fan favorite at both parks and Galaxy's Edge has been a great success at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
Of course, the high point of the quarter was a highly anticipated launch of our streaming service, Disney+. Thanks in large part to our incredible portfolio of great brands, the outstanding content from our creative engines and a robust technology platform. The launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful, exceeding even our greatest expectations. As we reported previously, we had more than 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ by the end of day 1. And we ended the quarter with 26.5 million paid subscribers. Since then, consumers have continued to sign up for the service directly at disneyplus.com through Verizon, which offers a free year of Disney+ to many of its customers at no additional cost, as well as through other distributors, including Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony and Roku. We recognize there's a lot of interest in this new business, and we wanted to give you some additional context. So I'm pleased to say that as of Monday, we were at 28.6 million paid subscribers. Going forward, it's our intention to announce subs as of the end of the quarter that we're reporting on. One additional note on sign-ups for Disney+, although we will not provide specifics, is that we are pleased to report that both conversion from free-to-pay and churn rates were better than we expected. We believe the subscriber growth to date and the overall reaction to Disney+ reflects a variety of factors that include the uniqueness of the service and excellent user interface and the high-quality of our brands and content. In fact, we're seeing the 4 quadrant appeal of our brands reflected in our subscriber numbers as well. 
On the content side, consumers have enthusiastically embraced the exceptional offering of classic movies and shorts from our studio, including Moana and Frozen; Disney Channel series by Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zach & Cody; recent theatrical releases like The Lion King, which became available on the service on January 28. The Simpsons is also quite popular with all 30 previous seasons available. And our growing slate of original content is also a great interest to our subscribers, especially The Mandalorian, which has quickly become a bona fide hit and a cultural phenomenon. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a certain child in The Mandalorian, who has taken the world by storm. I do believe the sensational response to this new character says so much about Disney+ and our company's ability to connect with audiences. We know there's great anticipation for the substantial array of Baby Yoda consumer products hitting the market in the coming months.
We'll continue to add high-quality content as a service that includes Frozen 2 and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Many of you probably saw our Super Bowl spot featuring 3 original new Marvel series for Disney+: Loki; The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which will premiere on the service in August; and WandaVision, which will debut in December. These same characters and actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with events from these new shows, will factor into future Marvel films as we integrate storytelling across these platforms, all under the Marvel Studio banner. We also have the highly anticipated return of The Mandalorian in October and multiple new series from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Nat Geo. So there's a lot to look forward to. Although our volume will increase, we remain focused on providing quality content from our core franchises and brands, not just quantity as we continue to build our portfolio. And the creative community has taken notice as well, many have expressed interest in joining Disney+'s roster of extraordinary talent. 
The next big priority is launching Disney+ in numerous international markets, starting in Western Europe on March 24 when we'll launch in the U.K. and Ireland, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Additional markets, including Belgium, the Nordics and Portugal will follow this summer. In December, we signed a deal with Canal +, the leading pay TV provider in France. We're currently in talks with several other potential distribution partners throughout the region. 
We're also excited to announce that we will be launching Disney+ in India through our Hotstar service on March 29 at the beginning of the Indian Premier League cricket season. We will be rebranding our existing Hotstar VIP and Premium subscription tiers to Disney+ Hotstar. We see this as a great opportunity to use the proven platform of Hotstar to launch the new Disney+ service in one of the most populous countries and fastest-growing economies in the world. 
Looking across our portfolio of Direct-to-Consumer businesses, we're also pleased with the growth of ESPN+. We ended the quarter with 6.6 million paid subscribers and as of Monday, we were at 7.6 million. We've been especially happy with a number of partnerships, particularly with the UFC. And the recent McGregor-Tyron fight brought in about 1 million pay-per-view purchases and 0.5 million new subscribers. And we'll continue to add content to the service on an opportunistic basis. 
At Hulu, we recently announced that we will be reorganizing the business to more closely integrate it into our Direct-to-Consumer segment in order to operate more efficiently and effectively as we look to expand our domestic consumer base as well as our presence outside the U.S. With respect to subscriber numbers, we remain optimistic about the future of the service. Hulu ended the quarter with 30.4 million paid subs. And as of Monday, the number was 30.7 million. 
During our last earnings call, we announced the launch of FX on Hulu, which will be available to all Hulu subscribers at no additional cost. Beginning next month, Hulu will be the exclusive streaming service for all new FX original programming. FX on Hulu will also offer in-season streaming as well as back seasons for most current and library series. We view this as a fantastic opportunity to expose FX's exceptional content to a broader audience while also making available to consumers in new ways. We believe there's tremendous appetite for our content. And the goal of FX on Hulu is to expand our reach to include those viewers who are not linear pay TV subscribers, and that includes many of who is young and highly engaged streaming audience. The addition of FX's programming is a step in the direction of continued increased investment in high-quality programming for Hulu, which will be developed and produced by our existing creative engines. 
It's often challenging for a company to pivot in a new strategic direction, particularly when it involves navigating between established and emerging business models. But since we announced our intention to shift our strategy, we have made an extraordinary amount of progress. This included a strategic reorganization of our company, creating a Direct-to-Consumer & International segment. We believe the new structure would better position our businesses for the future and now that we've completed the reorganization and launched Disney+, I'm more confident than ever in that decision. I'm enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we're now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Christine to talk more about our performance in the quarter, and then I'll be back to take your questions."
191564,650348235,1903810,"The Walt Disney Company, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2020",2020-02-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And a",1526,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.53. Fiscal 2020 is off to a good start as evidenced by our first quarter results. And as Bob discussed, we are incredibly pleased with the launch of Disney+ and the positive consumer response we have received to date. 
In terms of our fiscal first quarter results, our studio's creative momentum continues to deliver outstanding financial performance. Operating income was up significantly compared to Q1 last year, driven by growth in worldwide theatrical and higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio. Theatrical results reflect the performance of Frozen 2 and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in the quarter compared to theatrical releases last year, which included Ralph Breaks the Internet, Mary Poppins Returns and The Nutcracker. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. The increases in our legacy theatrical and TV/SVOD businesses were partially offset by a $50 million loss at the 21CF studio business as operating income from TV/SVOD distribution was more than offset by an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher results at consumer products and at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by lower results at our international parks and resorts. Consumer products operating income was up 25% due to growth in merchandise licensing as a result of strong revenue growth from sales of Frozen and Star Wars merchandise, both of which benefited from theatrical releases in the quarter. Revenue at domestic parks and experiences was up an impressive 10% in the quarter, driven by higher guest spending and, to a lesser extent, increases in attendance at our domestic parks and resorts. Operating income at domestic parks and experiences was up 6% as the flow-through from strong revenue growth was dampened by operational expenses associated with Galaxy's Edge and significant labor expense growth due to higher wages as a result of collective bargaining agreements. Attendance at our domestic parks was up 2% in the first quarter, and per capita guest spending was up 10% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 4%, and occupancy was 92%. So far this quarter, domestic resort reservations are pacing up 4% compared to this time last year, and booked rates at our domestic hotels are currently pacing up 10%. 
At our International operations, operating income was lower in Q1 as improved results at Shanghai Disney Resort were more than offset by a decline of about $80 million at Hong Kong Disneyland due to lower attendance and hotel occupancy. Hong Kong Disneyland's results in the quarter are consistent with the outlook we communicated last quarter. However, the recent closure of our parks in both Shanghai and Hong Kong due to the ongoing coronavirus situation will negatively impact second quarter and full year results. The current closure is taking place during the quarter in which we typically see strong attendance at occupancy levels due to the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday. The precise magnitude of the financial impact is highly dependent on the duration of the closures and how quickly we can resume normal operations. At Shanghai Disney Resort, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an adverse impact to second quarter operating income of approximately $135 million, assuming the park is closed for 2 months during Q2. At Hong Kong Disneyland, we currently estimate the closure of the park could have an additional adverse impact to operating income of about $40 million for the second quarter. As I discussed last quarter, we were already seeing a significant decrease in visitation to Hong Kong Disneyland from China and other parts of Asia. So in aggregate, we estimate these 2 factors could result in a decline in Hong Kong Disneyland's operating income of about $145 million for the second quarter. Again, this assumes the resort is closed for 2 months. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the first quarter due to increases at both cable and broadcasting. Higher cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, partially offset by a decrease at ESPN. At ESPN, growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs, primarily driven by contractual rate increases for NFL, college football and the launch of the ACC network in addition to lower ad revenue. ESPN's domestic linear advertising revenue was down 4.5% in the first quarter due to lower average viewership, primarily for NBA and College Football regular season games, which more than offset an increase in viewership for Monday Night Football. I'll note that when you look at ad revenue across all ESPN domestic ad platforms, which include digital and addressable advertising revenue reported in our DTCI segment, ESPN's total domestic ad revenue in the first quarter was roughly comparable to the prior year. So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing up 2% compared to last year. 
At Broadcasting, higher results in the quarter were due to the consolidation of 21CF and a benefit from new accounting guidance, which is explained further in our press release and 10-Q filing, partially offset by lower results from our legacy operations. Results at our legacy broadcasting operations were lower in the quarter as higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by lower ad revenue, a difficult program sales comp at ABC Studios and higher network programming and production costs. Lower program sales at ABC Studios reflect the prior year sale of Marvel's The Punisher during Q1 last year and no comparable sale in the first quarter this year. Total Broadcasting ad revenue was lower in the quarter, driven by lower political advertising at our owned stations and a decline at the ABC Network. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 19% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both Cable and Broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 14 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 2-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which was aided by about a 2.5-point benefit from the launch of the ACC Network. Operating losses at our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment increased in the quarter driven by costs incurred to support the successful launch of Disney+, the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and higher programming costs at ESPN+. These operating losses were partially offset by the consolidation of the 21CF International cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of $845 million, which was in line with the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $900 million in operating losses for the second quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in a number of European markets late in the second quarter and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $520 million. 
As Bob mentioned, Disney+ had 28.6 million paid subscribers as of yesterday, an increase of 2.1 million since the end of the first quarter. In the near term, we expect subscriber growth to come primarily from outside the U.S. with the next meaningful phase of domestic subscriber growth likely to coincide with the release later this calendar year of highly anticipated original content, including Episodic Series from Marvel and Season 2 of The Mandalorian. 
Turning to the Elimination segment. Revenue and profit eliminations were significantly higher in Q1, driven primarily by the intersegment content sales from Studio and Media Networks to DTCI. I'll note that our 10-Q this quarter contains additional detail on the general structure and accounting treatment of the various types of intersegment content transactions reflected in our segment results.
Lastly, we continue to make progress on realizing the value of the 21CF acquisition. The businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $590 million in segment operating income in the first quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive impact to total segment operating income of about $300 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a total dilutive impact on our Q1 EPS before purchase accounting of $0.27 per share. And we estimate the acquisition of 21st Century Fox and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu will have a dilutive impact on our Q2 earnings per share before purchase accounting of about $0.25 per share. We are still on track for the acquisition to be accretive to EPS before purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. 
I'll now turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

That",425,"Well, I don't know if you call it a surprise, but certainly, it's a learning because we didn't know until we launched. But we've been heartened by the fact that there's been basically consumption of a broad array of product across all of our brands. That is not just about original programming or not just about the Disney library, it's really about everything, including original shorts and older shorts and legacy Disney Channel shows, and of course, the library led by musicals and recent theatrical releases and Mandalorian but it has been very broad-based. And I mentioned earlier that about -- it was -- 65% of the people who watch Mandalorian, watch at least 10 other things on the service. So this was not about any one thing. 50% of people who use the service have watched movies as a for instance. So with that in mind, we feel that validates the collection of those brands and a blend of product that includes, obviously, the library or legacy TV and films of short form and long form, and then original programming. The trajectory in terms of our investment in original programming on the service is roughly the same as it would have been whereas it was before we launched, we haven't really changed it that much. Clearly, the original shows that we decide to invest and led by The Mandalorian have worked. And we knew when we launched that we were launching with a modest amount of original programming and that it would build over time. So as we look ahead, we're really comfortable with the volume that -- of product that we're creating and don't really feel that there's much that we have to adjust to right now. We have -- just as a for instance, we have a few Star Wars series in varying stages of production and development. We have the 3 Marvel series that were announced and I think there are 7 other Marvel series that are in varying stages of development or preproduction. There are a number of Disney Originals. We have Disney original movies coming, very pleased with them, by the way. And then we have a new one coming, Timmy Failure is 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, as a for instance. So we've got, I think, a great blend and don't feel a real need to adjust. And I think the best thing about it all is that the decision that we made to go with quality and not just volume is working.

We actually have a lot of specifics around it. But we've decided that the priority needs to be Disney+. We are launching, as I mentioned on the call, across multiple territories in Western Europe later in March and then in India, on March 29, and it's going to continue to roll out across the world going into 2021, including Latin America. And we feel that we need to concentrate on those launches and the marketing and the creation of product for those and then come in with Hulu right after or soon after that. So we don't have specifics, except we do plan to begin rolling Hulu out, I'd say, probably in 2021, internationally, that is, after the Disney+ launch. 
On the NFL side, look, it's very early to speculate. I think the ratings for the NFL suggests that while there's a lot of disruption, there's a fair amount of erosion. And you see people basically watching programs from multiple new sources and creating more competition for the traditional linear networks. The live sports has held up really well led, of course, by the NFL. So our interest in the NFL remains very strong, and there have been only preliminary discussions and nothing more, and it would be premature for me to give you any more detail."

They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world",591,"Well, first of all, those brands are global brands, each one of them, including Star Wars, which may be what you're alluding to, Ben. They have varying strengths in different markets, Disney is probably the strongest on a consistent basis across the world, but they all have -- there's brand affinity and brand interest in all of them, which I think is one of the things that is a strong selling point for us into markets. So I don't really think that we necessarily need to do much adjusting as it relates to the product that has been designed for the U.S., except to make sure, obviously, that the programs adopted the local language properly and in high quality and secondly, that we have enough local programming, either to meet local quotas or simply to address local tastes. One of the interesting things, by the way, about Star Wars and The Mandalorian because there's been some things written after the Rise of Skywalker that the popularity of Star Wars in certain international markets where that Star Wars in certain international market has never caught on. One of the reasons for that is that there isn't a Star Wars legacy in many of these markets, China being a main one, where people didn't grow up on that franchise or that brand. So when they tuned into or heard about the Skywalker legacy, there was too much that had already gone on in the past that was not familiar to them, and they didn't really want to get on board late. That's not true with Mandalorian because Mandalorian is -- even though it's based on obviously, certain Star Wars elements, characters and places, you don't have to know anything about the history of Star Wars in terms of an access point or in terms of your interest. So anyway, we feel great about the popularity of our brands. Interesting, the Disney brand globally has never been more popular. 
And the other thing I want to say is that the brand studies that we've seen or brand research that we've seen in the United States suggests that interest and affinity in the Disney brand has actually risen nicely, thanks to Disney+, particularly among young people. I think a lot of that has to do with the relevance of the platform, the technology, the manner of presentation. I think it's a loud statement about what's going on in the world today in terms of consumer tastes, particularly young people, which is why the demographics of Hulu were substantially younger than the demographics on some of our traditional linear networks, et cetera, et cetera. 
India, we're going to launch bundled with Hotstar, directly bundled, meaning it's Disney+ Hotstar as a product. We're not giving specifics about price at this point but expect that there will be 2 primary products brought into India. One will be more premium in nature that will include the entire library plus original programming. And the other one will be more basic that will have the library and not the original programming. Price for the market and launched at a very peak period of time for the IPL, the Cricket League. And so we think it's an opportune moment. We take advantage of the presence of Star in the market and the millions of subscribers that they also have, we take advantage of the sports tie-in, and we use the interface and the technology that includes the billing that already exists to launch a service, we believe, under very, very optimal circumstances."

We did extremely well, basically with a direct-to-consumer package and ARPU that was higher. And so the 26.5 million in subscribers came roughly 50% directly through disneyplus.com. For instance, where not only weren't we revenue sharing with others, but a lot of those subscribers, well, many of them may have bought a year-long service or even a 3-year. Many of them bought basically the month for the full price. About 20% of those subscribers came from Verizon, and the rest came from the variety of other services that is distributing the app and including the iTunes platform. So we were actually very pleased with the diversity of basically routes that people took to get to us and extremely pleased with the ARPU. Now I also understand that the vast majority came from domestic because we only launched in a couple of territories, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands and Canada with this, and so these are mostly domestic subs. But I think that it's all a very positive story in terms of the manner in which people bought this, and as I said earlier, the ARPU. And the other thing that we noted was that the bundle with ESPN and with Hulu was very helpful in terms of lowering churn rates. And as I said on -- in my remarks, both the conversion from free-to-pay as well as the churn rates were much better than we expected they would be, and much better than we had estimated they would be before we launched. And I think, again, that's the result of -- it starts with the product. And I think the end -- the user interface also got incredibly high marks in terms of the ease of use, the ease of navigation, the quality of the product, the value of the brands and the price point, which we can't ignore, a very accessible price point priced purposely because of the brand and our desire to be as accessible as possible on a broad basis. Regarding the studio, looking at $11 billion-plus box office year from the Disney Studio alone is not something we're likely to repeat right away. But as we look ahead, we're extremely pleased with the long-term prospects for our studio and the slate. I could name a number of titles, but this year, for instance, we have 2 Pixar titles with Onward and Soul in the marketplace. We've got a couple of really strong Disney-branded Jungle Cruise and Mulan. We have, obviously, Marvel with Black Widow initial -- at first and then the -- the rest -- at the end of the year. And you can imagine a lot of development from all of those. On the Star Wars front, where as I had mentioned in previous calls, we're taking a bit of a hiatus in terms of the theatrical release. We finished the 9-episode Skywalker Saga, and we're developing both television and features. The priority in the next few years is television with The Mandalorian Season 2 coming in October and then more coming from The Mandalorian thereafter, including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and the possibility of taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series. And then we have a prequel to Rogue One and an Obi-Wan series also in development. So the priority for Star Wars in the short term is going to be, I'll call it, television for Disney+ and then we will have more to say about development of theatrical soon after that. But 2020 is not going to be the same as 2019 for the studio but we still expect a very strong year. And given the franchises and the talent that we both work with and have working for us, we're confident that the studio is going to continue to be a strong driver of operating income for the company, both on the movie front, but also as a great supplier of product, both original and secondary market for Disney+ and for Hulu, by the way."

Because of all this, we're halfway to the goal and the model -- the metrics seem to be hitting. Can we expect the profitability to come in sooner than the '24 number? And then if we can just focus on the U.S., I think you guys gave guidance for 20 million to 30 million subs in the U.S. And again, you're sort of at the high end -- or around the high end of that guidance.

The 60 million to 90 million included, obviously, 2/3 of that subs that we were going to get from outside the United States where, except for just a few markets, we've not even launched yet. So it's far too early for us after basically a quarter and a little bit more under our belt to change our guidance having not launched in any of the big international markets yet. What we know about those markets, not to, in any way, pour cold water on them because we know that those brands are strong in the markets, and this product is already working, the interest in streaming in general in those markets isn't as high as it has been in the United States. I'm talking about across the world. So we have probably more of a marketing effort. And I'd say more of a challenge to launch in those markets, not that those markets haven't been already seated with streaming. We know Netflix has done extremely well internationally. But we're just beginning there. And I think it's just premature for us to take our guidance up. What we do know, of course, is that we have reached a number in the United States that since you did the math, that suggests that we're at the number that we predicted we would be in year 5, just after a very short period of time. And I don't know whether that is a statement about the total available market or the quality of the product or both or the price, this is just, I think, a number of factors that I've touched upon, and I just look over them one more time. Those brands are extreme -- not only are they high quality, it is a very unique product. I was asked earlier on CNBC about whether I felt threatened by competition. There's obviously more competition coming into the space. But there isn't any competition that is like ours, like our product because of the investments that we've made in those franchises and the quality of the product that we've made over the years and we're continuing to make. So we're very differentiated. We're extremely well-priced, and we created a service from a technical basis and a user interface basis that is really working. There's an elegance to it and an ease, and we feel great about it. So our -- as we look ahead at that guidance, I can't say that we won't change it at some point. But it's -- we don't believe that it would be prudent for us to adjust it at this point. And we have a long way to go."

So is the content that's available on the service in the U.S., also sort of the same content available in Europe?

That's extremely high. We measure frequency, which is the number of times people stream per week since launch. And we measure engagement, which is basically how many hours people have streamed on a weekly basis per subscriber. And I don't think we should get into all those details right now, except to say that in all 3 cases, recency, the percentage of people that are weekly active users are very, very high; the same thing is true with frequency, the number of average days that they actually use the service. And again, this is something that we've seen over both -- for basically the first quarter. I think these numbers probably relate to the first quarter and not necessarily since December 28. That's also very high in the engagement. And when you're looking at multiple hours a week stream per subscriber. I can give you that. Now that's in the 6 to 7 hours a week range. Very, very high. Now Christmas was in there, time when a lot of families were off, that may have actually skewed that a little bit high. But again, we're seeing consumption, I'll call it, across the board. And some of it is quite interesting to us. Pixar has done extremely well, as, for instance, including their shorts. Musicals are doing very, very well. Obviously, great interest in some of the big titles that have recently come on the service, Toy Story 4 just came on, Rise of Skywalker later in the year, lion King came on, Avengers, I mentioned, Endgame. It's kind of, I guess -- without, in any way, sounding like we're bragging, it validates the concept of putting those brands together and collecting library. As we look to the rest of the world, there really isn't anything to cite in terms of encumbrances that would be an issue. We're in relatively good shape there. I'd say that we have some work to do in terms of local product because there are quotas in certain markets that we have to meet. But the universal appeal of this product is pretty strong. You do have to factor in that in some markets, there's lower broadband penetration. And so you don't have -- the total available market is not as high as it is in other markets. Netherlands was very high that's why they decided to launch there. South Korea is very high, but there are other markets, obviously, India being one, that you have lower broadband. But huge opportunities for us internationally, and that's where that Disney name and the family nature of the product, I think, will resonate extremely well."

Let me take the domestic part question on international visitation. We have typically run in the 18% to 22% range for guests outside of the U.S. We're at the low end of that range, maybe a tick below right now because some of the South American markets because of the disruption in those economies have -- had lower visitation. The 2 I would cite would be -- that won't be a surprise to anyone, would be Brazil and Argentina. In general, the parks do not have a significant amount of visitation from Asia. The -- in -- when you look at Walt Disney World, no Asian market even back into the top 5 and the top 1 being the U.K., which I think everyone knows that. And then we have Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Argentina that is for the East Coast Walt Disney World. And then when you look at Disneyland, Canada is a very strong market for us, no surprise, just given proximity to the West Coast markets of Vancouver. And then we also have Mexico, Australia. And the only market that even breaks into the top 5 would be Japan in -- and it's actually a very low single-digit number for Disneyland.

And of course, lastly, there's a yield story to tell, and that's been exceptional. That is a combination of things, but clearly, far more sophisticated, more thoughtful pricing strategy has helped a lot, taking advantage of peak periods and pricing leverage but also making the park more accessible in nonpeak periods for others at substantially more accessible prices."

So we will still -- we still believe that our studio will be very successful this year. And we have confidence in their content resonating with consumers on a global basis. Bob already mentioned some of the big movies that we have coming out, and we feel really good about those. As it relates to transfer pricing of content, the studio definitely will benefit from the content sales to DTCI, the pay one windows, and we had quite a few movies come out in fiscal '19 that will make it into the pay one window in fiscal '20, and that will also have a positive impact on the studio."

Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call, and the challenges we're now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard, and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who's been around for a while and led this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. 
We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team, now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company's objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect, when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together, taking an all-hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we're facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them. Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown, we've maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. 
We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They miss doing the things they enjoy, things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy in the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories and uplift and enrich people's lives. 
While much of our operations are shut down, we've been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects while also continuing post-production work for our media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I've been working with our creative teams across the company and I am extremely excited about what's in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. 
Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter, and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives. And to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others. It's all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering, and we couldn't be more proud of them. And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob."

When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined a suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives physically, psychologically, financially, causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another, either personally or through someone they know: a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness. From the courageous health care workers caring for people on the front lines in hospitals across the country to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities, we're grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. 
Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we're also grateful to our own employees starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock. Our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports. Our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts. They're doing a phenomenal job, and we could not be more proud of them. 
As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely. suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guests and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. 
In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS totaled to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier, primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the disruption we're seeing across our company as well as our confidence and our ability to weather the storm. While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world: Shanghai and Hong Kong since January; Tokyo since February and our U.S. and Paris Park since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disney Town, we and our government partners, Shanghai Shande Group plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. 
Moving to media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports, finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10 part docu series on Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls, the Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the #1 program in America amongst all key male demos since sports halted. 
ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turned into a virtual one with the NFL Draft. This resulted in a bigger audience than ever before, with a record 55 million plus viewers over the 3-day event. The Draft was a particularly impressive technological feat, driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. 
When you look at the impact of these 2 events, ESPN's April primetime audience was up 11% versus last year among adults, 18 to 49. In fact, it ranked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out 3 new films as part of its award-winning 30-for-30 series. We're also going to air a virtual 2020 SPs on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it's a gradual process or sports return for a period without spectators in the stands, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovation that we saw with the NFL Draft and continue to deliver a great experience for sports fans. 
On the Studio side, we're incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theaters closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we've had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney's Mulan for July 24; Marvel's Black Widow for November 6; Pixar's Soul on November 20; and 20th Century's Free Guy set for December 11. As many of you already know, part of this fall originally slated for a theatrical run will debut exclusively at Disney+ starting on June 12. As we've said, our company's top priority and our key to our growth is our Direct-to-Consumer business. And I'm pleased to say that the response to Disney+, in particular, has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November, and we continue to expand into other markets. 
In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, a we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months, we had surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We've been quite pleased with the growth that we've seen in the 4 weeks since then, and there's more to come. 
Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney's Frozen 2 and Pixar's Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter-at-home. Yesterday's SVOD Premier of Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+'s most successful series, the Mandalorian, along with the fall premier of National Geographics original Series, The Right stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolf about NASA's project Mercury. This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly 45% of Hulu subscribers have excessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu's strong original series continue to perform extremely well, as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We're enormously proud of what we've accomplished to date, and we're optimistic for the future. As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees while continuing to receive their full health care benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones, given the unprecedented challenges that we're faced with. 
Now before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said, and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company with a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions."

These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our second quarter operating income was as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. 
Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the [indiscernible]. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. 
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which, combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I'll note that the $12.25 billion credit facilities also served to backstop our commercial paper program. 
We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional litigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of the semiannual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash, assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share.  We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. 
Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our Parks and Experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14, and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. 
As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we've announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results had on impairments. Lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including the Lion King, Toy Story 4 and Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. 
The 21CF Studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
Turning to media Networks. Operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. 
More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I'll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How To Get Away With Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter, driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN, where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the college football playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and College Basketball Championship week. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory, coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first 6 episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all-time 
[Audio Gap]
quarter, driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of $33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of their widely distributed tiers. And in India to convert our pre-existing subscription-based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. 
As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 15 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers, reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. 
Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer and international segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+, to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTC. 
And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation. And given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially, and the conditions under which they reopen, we don't intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. 
These are uncertain times, and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

Based on the growth you're seeing, but certainly over the next couple of quarters.

As you know, we're dealing with a situation that's very fluid. And things are changing. So the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2-ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16th. And then you had the Asian Parks closed. Shanghai closed fully in January, on the 25th. Hong Kong closed on the 26th. Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29th. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the Parks business and Products, for the quarter, just for that second quarter, about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the 2 weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian -- or the international parks and cruise, which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong, we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong. And then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we closed. And I'm going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that."

Just trying to get a sense of what sort of capacity you think could still sort of get you to breakeven or profitability? And then my second question is just on the Studio side of the business. Mulan were in the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late in July. And I guess, are you comfortable with opening that movie to what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess, overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings and your decision to begin to start releasing films this climate?"

In terms of how we look at our park reopenings and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. In other words, it's not about breakeven point for profitability necessarily, but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we're thinking is that while every site is completely different, that's the approach that we're going to take. And frankly, we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. In terms of the second question, in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see when it opens up, we're going to get a pretty good idea of that because there's a competitive movie that opens up 1 week before our film does. And at that point, we're hoping that there's some return to a semblance of normal in terms of number of screens that are opening in a number o show times For those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that's our first big movie out the gate. But again, between some balance of limited number of seats and theaters as social distancing is practiced by the exhibitors, combined with what's got to be an incredible pent-up demand. I think we'll certainly find out and maybe we'll find out the week before what's competitive movie."

And we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. In terms of the CapEx question, obviously, we had a lot of really big plans in the parks. And we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we're doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint. But we have such great intellectual property and our imagineers over at our theme parks, where the majority of our capital goes, have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we're just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures, but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that, that will probably be the last of our travel-oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough, long term, all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously, not in the next few months, but much more resilient than any of the competitor businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help, to the extent possible, protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit."

Therefore, we'll staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we'll approach that. Obviously, labor is a huge component of our cost base. And so that will slide with the attendance. And that's why I said when we're looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we're going to be targeting for, it's really look at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we're going to sort of cover the entire or not.

So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they're not out-of-pocket for any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as 3 levels. There's the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that, depreciation, is a noncash item. The other 2, obviously, are cash items. Then you have the variable costs and those are cost of goods sold, and that's where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on, on the time curve. And then there's another chunk of costs where we would put in labor, and that is what we call semi-fixed. And they're fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees. Once again, we're not -- we wouldn't have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks would be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we're now in 2 months. And it also includes -- then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed, and that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we've been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we've also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed."

So we're going to approach that very, very slowly. But after a few weeks, we'll actually be up to what the government's guideline is. And at that point, there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which part you're talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and a lot less folks that stay overnight, a lot less guests that stay overnight, where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually families that actually fly in to go visit there. So -- but we have a fairly robust Annual Pass program at both parks and a big drive-in market as well.

But on the other hand, we've seen some advertisers opportunistically increasing their spend. And some of those industry groups are things like financial services, tech, telecom, the DTC or streaming services. And also consumer packaged goods.

So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another, whether it's between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know, we've made quite a number of changes, given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back. And look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers and how they want to enjoy how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us. And that is a perfect example of being nimble.

Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call, and the challenges we're now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard, and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who's been around for a while and led this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. 
We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team, now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company's objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect, when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together, taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we're facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we've maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. 
We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They miss doing the things they enjoy, things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people's lives. 
While much of our operations are shut down, we've been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects while also continuing post-production work for our media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I've been working with our creative teams across the company, and I am extremely excited about what's in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. 
Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others. It's all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering, and we couldn't be more proud of them. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating",1560,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives physically, psychologically, financially, causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another, either personally or through someone they know: a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness. From the courageous health care workers caring for people on the front lines in hospitals across the country to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities, we're grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. 
Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we're also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports; our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts. They're doing a phenomenal job, and we could not be more proud of them. 
As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guests and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. 
In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier, primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the disruption we're seeing across our company as well as our confidence in our ability to weather the storm. While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world: Shanghai and Hong Kong since January; Tokyo since February and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park-adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partner, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government-required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. 
Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports, finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the #1 program in America amongst all key male demos since sports halted. 
ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turned it into a virtual one with the NFL Draft. This resulted in a bigger audience than ever before, with a record 55 million-plus viewers over the 3-day event. The Draft was a particularly impressive technological feat, driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. 
When you look at the impact of these 2 events, ESPN's April prime time audience was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it ranked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out 3 new films as part of its award-winning 30 for 30 series. We're also going to air a virtual 2020 ESPY on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it's a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stands, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovation that we saw with the NFL Draft and continue to deliver a great experience for sports fans. 
On the studio side, we're incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theaters closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we've had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney's Mulan for July 24; Marvel's Black Widow for November 6; Pixar's Soul on November 20; and 20th Century's Free Guy set for December 11. As many of you already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we've said, our company's top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I'm pleased to say that the response to Disney+, in particular, has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November, and we continue to expand into other markets. 
In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months, we had surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We've been quite pleased with the growth that we've seen in the 4 weeks since then, and there's more to come. 
Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney's Frozen 2 and Pixar's Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter-at-home. Yesterday's SVOD premiere of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+'s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premiere of National Geographic's original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA's Project Mercury. 
This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu's strong original series continue to perform extremely well, as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We're enormously proud of what we've accomplished to date, and we're optimistic for the future. 
As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees while continuing to receive their full health care benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we're faced with. 
Now before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said, and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions."

These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption",2056,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our second quarter operating income was as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. 
Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. 
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which, combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I'll note that the $12.25 billion credit facilities also served to backstop our commercial paper program. 
We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of the semiannual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash, assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. 
Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14, and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. 
As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we've announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. 
The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. 
More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I'll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter, driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN, where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the college football playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first 6 episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all-time. 
Additionally, the NFL Draft was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the 3-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these 2 events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming, and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter, driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of 33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of their widely distributed tiers and, in India, to convert our preexisting subscription-based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. 
As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 50 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers, reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. 
Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+, to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. 
And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation. And given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don't intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. 
These are uncertain times, and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

As you know, we're dealing with a situation that's very fluid. And things are changing. So the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2-ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16th. And then you had the Asian Parks closed. Shanghai closed fully in January, on the 25th. Hong Kong closed on the 26th. Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29th. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products, for the quarter, just for that second quarter, about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the 2 weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian -- or the international parks and cruise which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong, we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong. And then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we closed. And I'm going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that."

And then my second question is just on the studio side of the business. Mulan is one of the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late July. And I guess are you comfortable with opening that movie to what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess, overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings in your decision to begin to start releasing films in this climate?"

Alexia, in terms of how we look at our park reopenings and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. In other words, it's not about breakeven point for profitability necessarily but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we're thinking is that while every site is completely different, that's the approach that we're going to take. And frankly, we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. 
In terms of the second question, in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see when it opens up, we're going to get a pretty good idea of that because there's a competitive movie that opens up 1 week before our film does. And at that point, we're hoping that there's some return to a semblance of normal in terms of number of screens that are opening and the number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that's our first big movie out of the gate. But again, between some balance of limited number of seats and theaters as social distancing is practiced by the exhibitors combined with what's got to be an incredible pent-up demand, I think we'll certainly find out and maybe we'll find out a week before with the competitive movie."

So we're going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation, as we are doing right now during this coronavirus situation.

In terms of the future rights and the business models, we think that live sports remain incredibly valuable to us, and we continue to have an interest in live sports rights given the unique slate of assets that we own, with ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC. And we're going to do that, though, as we always have done, in a very disciplined manner. Existing consumer trends play a real big part on how we think about the value of sports rights as they make the transition from linear over to digital. And I think it really -- it's a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we're obviously highly interested in those. And we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. 
In terms of the CapEx question, obviously, we had a lot of really big plans in the parks. And we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we're doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint. But we have such great intellectual property, and our Imagineers over at our theme parks, where the majority of our capital goes, have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we're just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. 
And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that, that will probably be the last of our travel-oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough, long term, all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously, not in the next few months, but much more resilient than any of the competitor businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help, to the extent possible, protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit."

But that being said, and this just builds on some of the things Bob said, this is a business that is one of our highest-rated businesses in terms of guest satisfaction. And it also has a very high intent to repeat the experience. So a lot of people who go on one tend to go back for multiple cruises. So -- and it's also a business when we look at it from an ROI perspective -- ROIC perspective, it's a very nice returning business, creating value long term for shareholders."

In terms of the signals we look for park opening, our hypothesis is because of pent-up demand that if we open up, it's something less than 50% of our standard capacity that we're probably not going to have trouble filling that. So whatever level we state that at, whether it's 10%, 25% or 50% of typical crowds, that's what we'll be able to have at our park. Therefore, we'll staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we'll approach that. Obviously, labor is a huge component of our cost base. And so that will slide with the attendance. And that's why I said when we're looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we're going to be targeting for, it's really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we're going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible. Obviously, we'll practice the yield strategy overall, just like we always have."

Michael, on the furloughed employees, so the impact that we saw on our parks full segment for Q2 included fully paying everybody. We continued to do that until -- in early April, when we did furlough, company-wide, over 100,000 employees. But most of those employees were in the parks segment by just sheer numbers. So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they're not out-of-pocket for any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. 
And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as 3 levels. There's the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that, depreciation, is a noncash item. The other 2, obviously, are cash items. Then you have the variable costs, and those are cost of goods sold, and that's where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on, on the time curve. And then there's another chunk of costs where we would put in labor, and that is what we call semi-fixed. And they're fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees. Once again, we're not -- we wouldn't have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks would be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we're now in 2 months. And it also includes -- then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed, and that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we've been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we've also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed."

And at that point, there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. 
In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which park you're talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and a lot less folks that stay overnight, a lot less guests that stay overnight, where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually -- families that actually fly in to go visit there.

So can you talk about your ability to maybe air some of the content that would traditionally be on ESPN on ABC? And how are you thinking about the fall or winter season in terms of programming?

So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another, whether it's between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know, we've made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers, how they want to enjoy, how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us. And that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over 3 nights, over 50 million households, which is obviously a huge increase. And I think that speaks volumes to the fact that our cast and our executives over those networks do a phenomenal job of being able to adjust on the fly."

Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call, and the challenges we're now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard, and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who's been around for a while and led this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. 
We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team, now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company's objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect, when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together, taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we're facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we've maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. 
We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They miss doing the things they enjoy, things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people's lives. 
While much of our operations are shut down, we've been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects while also continuing post-production work for our media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I've been working with our creative teams across the company, and I am extremely excited about what's in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. 
Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others. It's all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering, and we couldn't be more proud of them. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating",1560,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives physically, psychologically, financially, causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another, either personally or through someone they know: a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness. From the courageous health care workers caring for people on the front lines in hospitals across the country to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities, we're grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. 
Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we're also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports; our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts. They're doing a phenomenal job, and we could not be more proud of them. 
As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guests and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. 
In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier, primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the disruption we're seeing across our company as well as our confidence in our ability to weather the storm. While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world: Shanghai and Hong Kong since January; Tokyo since February and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park-adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partner, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government-required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. 
Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports, finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the #1 program in America amongst all key male demos since sports halted. 
ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turned it into a virtual one with the NFL Draft. This resulted in a bigger audience than ever before, with a record 55 million-plus viewers over the 3-day event. The Draft was a particularly impressive technological feat, driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. 
When you look at the impact of these 2 events, ESPN's April prime time audience was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it ranked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out 3 new films as part of its award-winning 30 for 30 series. We're also going to air a virtual 2020 ESPY on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it's a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stands, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovation that we saw with the NFL Draft and continue to deliver a great experience for sports fans. 
On the studio side, we're incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theaters closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we've had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney's Mulan for July 24; Marvel's Black Widow for November 6; Pixar's Soul on November 20; and 20th Century's Free Guy set for December 11. As many of you already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we've said, our company's top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I'm pleased to say that the response to Disney+, in particular, has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November, and we continue to expand into other markets. 
In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months, we had surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We've been quite pleased with the growth that we've seen in the 4 weeks since then, and there's more to come. 
Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney's Frozen 2 and Pixar's Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter-at-home. Yesterday's SVOD premiere of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+'s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premiere of National Geographic's original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA's Project Mercury. 
This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu's strong original series continue to perform extremely well, as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We're enormously proud of what we've accomplished to date, and we're optimistic for the future. 
As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees while continuing to receive their full health care benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we're faced with. 
Now before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said, and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions."

These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption",2056,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our second quarter operating income was as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. 
Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. 
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which, combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I'll note that the $12.25 billion credit facilities also served to backstop our commercial paper program. 
We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of the semiannual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash, assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. 
Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14, and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. 
As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we've announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. 
The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. 
More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I'll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter, driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN, where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the college football playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first 6 episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all-time. 
Additionally, the NFL Draft was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the 3-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these 2 events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming, and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter, driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of 33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of their widely distributed tiers and, in India, to convert our preexisting subscription-based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. 
As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 50 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers, reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. 
Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+, to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. 
And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation. And given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don't intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year.

As you know, we're dealing with a situation that's very fluid. And things are changing. So the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2-ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16th. And then you had the Asian Parks closed. Shanghai closed fully in January, on the 25th. Hong Kong closed on the 26th. Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29th. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products, for the quarter, just for that second quarter, about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the 2 weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian -- or the international parks and cruise which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong, we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong. And then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we closed. And I'm going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that."

Just trying to get a sense of what sort of capacity you think could still sort of get you to breakeven or profitability. 
And then my second question is just on the studio side of the business. Mulan is one of the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late July. And I guess are you comfortable with opening that movie to what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess, overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings in your decision to begin to start releasing films in this climate?"

Alexia, in terms of how we look at our park reopenings and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. In other words, it's not about breakeven point for profitability necessarily but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we're thinking is that while every site is completely different, that's the approach that we're going to take. And frankly, we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. 
In terms of the second question, in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see when it opens up, we're going to get a pretty good idea of that because there's a competitive movie that opens up 1 week before our film does. And at that point, we're hoping that there's some return to a semblance of normal in terms of number of screens that are opening and the number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that's our first big movie out of the gate. But again, between some balance of limited number of seats and theaters as social distancing is practiced by the exhibitors combined with what's got to be an incredible pent-up demand, I think we'll certainly find out and maybe we'll find out a week before with the competitive movie."

And we're going to do that, though, as we always have done, in a very disciplined manner.

And I think it really -- it's a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we're obviously highly interested in those. And we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. 
In terms of the CapEx question, obviously, we had a lot of really big plans in the parks. And we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we're doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint. But we have such great intellectual property, and our Imagineers over at our theme parks, where the majority of our capital goes, have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we're just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. 
And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that, that will probably be the last of our travel-oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough, long term, all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously, not in the next few months, but much more resilient than any of the competitor businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help, to the extent possible, protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit."

Therefore, we'll staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we'll approach that. Obviously, labor is a huge component of our cost base. And so that will slide with the attendance. And that's why I said when we're looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we're going to be targeting for, it's really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we're going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible.

The big chunk of that, depreciation, is a noncash item. The other 2, obviously, are cash items. Then you have the variable costs, and those are cost of goods sold, and that's where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on, on the time curve. And then there's another chunk of costs where we would put in labor, and that is what we call semi-fixed. And they're fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees. Once again, we're not -- we wouldn't have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks would be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we're now in 2 months. And it also includes -- then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed, and that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we've been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we've also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed."

I imagine if you opened it far below attendance, as you talked about, you would have a lot of pent-up demand. And then you kind of got to decide who gets to come in and what the screening measures are. And it seems like a whole Pandora's box. So I'm just wondering about your willingness to sort of wait into that debate versus waiting for a vaccine. 
And then second on Hulu, kind of modest sequential growth in the live product, but ARPU was up a lot. Can you help us think about how much of that was the pricing versus the ad ARPU or the subscription versus the ad ARPU?

So we're going to approach that very, very slowly. But after a few weeks, we'll actually be up to what the government's guideline is. And at that point, there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. 
In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which park you're talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and a lot less folks that stay overnight, a lot less guests that stay overnight, where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually -- families that actually fly in to go visit there. So -- but we have a fairly robust annual pass program at both parks and a big drive-in market as well.

But on the other hand, we've seen some advertisers opportunistically increasing their spend. And some of those industry groups are things like financial services, tech, telecom, the DTC or streaming services and also consumer packaged goods.

So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another, whether it's between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know, we've made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers, how they want to enjoy, how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us. And that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over 3 nights, over 50 million households, which is obviously a huge increase.

Obviously, much has changed in the world since our last earnings call, and the challenges we're now facing are unprecedented. Like so many other companies and industries, the pandemic has hit us hard, and both Bob and Christine will walk you through the specifics. However, as someone who's been around for a while and led this company through some really tough days over the last 15 years, including economic downturns, natural disasters and other unforeseen events, I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully. The Walt Disney Company has demonstrated repeatedly over its nearly 100-year history that it is exceptionally resilient. And I believe this time will be no different. 
We entered this crisis with a strong hand and an exceptional management team, now led by Bob Chapek. And as we said in February, when Bob was announced as CEO, he and I continue to work in partnership in support of the company's objectives and to ensure a smooth and successful transition. As you would expect, when dealing with a challenge of this magnitude, the entire team is working closely together, taking an all hands on deck approach to address the difficult issues we're facing. Of course, one key to our resilience is the strength of our brands and the strong emotional connection people have to them: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, ABC, ESPN and Star Wars. In fact, recent studies have shown we've maintained that connection with consumers throughout this crisis. 
We also have a tremendous collection of assets. And beyond that, what we create has never been more necessary or more important than right now. In fact, it's quite possible that what we create is appreciated now more than ever because people find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism. This is the same reason we believe people will resume familiar activities once this crisis ends. They miss doing the things they enjoy, things that make them feel happy and connected with family and friends, whether it's going to movie theaters to see our films or visiting our theme parks around the world or watching live sports on ESPN. People want good news. They want to experience joy and the feeling of togetherness. And for all these reasons, we will continue to tell stories that uplift and enrich people's lives. 
While much of our operations are shut down, we've been fortunate to keep parts of our creative pipeline active, including a number of writing and development projects while also continuing post-production work for our media networks, our studios and Disney+. And I've been working with our creative teams across the company, and I am extremely excited about what's in store. I have no doubt that we will get through this, but it will take some time. 
Before I turn it over to Bob and Christine to talk about the quarter and the strategy going forward and to answer your questions, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for all of the medical professionals across our country who are fighting valiantly to save lives and to everyone helping to flatten the curve by heeding the advice of health officials and others. It's all making a difference. On behalf of Bob and myself, I also want to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees around the world who continue to show incredible ingenuity, commitment, patience and understanding during these trying times. Even in the face of adversity, their dedication to our company and our mission is unwavering, and we couldn't be more proud of them. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to Bob."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating",1560,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. When I stepped into this new job 2.5 months ago, none of us could have imagined the suffering and sacrifice that we're now seeing around the world. This devastating pandemic is like nothing most of us have ever experienced in our lifetime. This had a profound impact on millions of lives physically, psychologically, financially, causing tremendous hardship and loss. And just about everyone has been affected in one way or another, either personally or through someone they know: a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. Fortunately, amidst the adversity, we see the best of humanity demonstrated through inspiring acts of compassion and selflessness. From the courageous health care workers caring for people on the front lines in hospitals across the country to our first responders and others providing essential services throughout our communities, we're grateful for and deeply appreciative of their efforts. 
Here at Disney, as Bob mentioned, we're also grateful to our own employees, starting with our local and national ABC News teams providing critical and factual information around the clock; our ESPN team providing compelling programming in the absence of live sports; our global security personnel and key staff who are safeguarding and maintaining our parks and resorts. They're doing a phenomenal job, and we could not be more proud of them. 
As you know, Disney, like many other companies, has experienced widespread disruption. In mid-March, we closed our domestic parks and hotels indefinitely, suspended our cruise line, halted film and TV productions and shuttered our retail stores. And while these were necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of our guests and employees, our businesses have been hugely impacted. 
In the second fiscal quarter, adjusted EPS fell to $0.60 a share from $1.61 a year earlier, primarily due to the suspended operations I just outlined. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter and the ongoing financial impact of COVID-19. Before she does, I want to share a few thoughts on the disruption we're seeing across our company as well as our confidence in our ability to weather the storm. While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks. As you know, our parks have been closed around the world: Shanghai and Hong Kong since January; Tokyo since February and our U.S. and Paris parks since mid-March. The approach we take may include implementation of guest capacity and density control measures as well as health and prevention procedures that comply with state and federal guidelines. We are seeing encouraging signs of a gradual return to some semblance of normalcy in China. And in light of the lifting of certain restrictions in recent weeks and the successful reopening of our park-adjacent retail and food and beverage area, Disneytown, we and our government partner, Shanghai Shendi Group, plan to open Shanghai Disneyland on May 11. We will take a phased approach with limits on attendance using an advanced reservation and entry system, controlled guest density using social distancing and strict government-required health and prevention procedures. These include the use of masks, temperature screenings and other contact tracing and early detection systems. 
Moving to Media Networks, ESPN has truly stepped up in the absence of live sports, finding new and innovative ways to deliver compelling content that fans want. This included releasing, 2 months early, the highly anticipated 10-part docuseries on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, The Last Dance. The series, which continues through May 17, is the most viewed ESPN documentary ever and currently ranks as the #1 program in America amongst all key male demos since sports halted. 
ESPN also took what has historically been an engaging life event and turned it into a virtual one with the NFL Draft. This resulted in a bigger audience than ever before, with a record 55 million-plus viewers over the 3-day event. The Draft was a particularly impressive technological feat, driven by more than 600 remote camera feeds from homes across the U.S. 
When you look at the impact of these 2 events, ESPN's April prime time audience was up 11% versus last year among adults 18 to 49. In fact, it ranked as the top cable network among this key demographic. Going forward, ESPN is going to be rolling out 3 new films as part of its award-winning 30 for 30 series. We're also going to air a virtual 2020 ESPY on June 21. Additionally, ESPN will be bringing back several more of its marquee studio programs beginning the week of May 11. This will expand their live and quick turnaround studio programming to 11 straight hours each weekday. Sports will come back strong. And when they do, we believe ESPN is best positioned to benefit with more offerings than anyone else. And if it's a gradual process, where sports return for a period without spectators in the stands, we can count on ESPN to bring the same level of innovation that we saw with the NFL Draft and continue to deliver a great experience for sports fans. 
On the studio side, we're incredibly excited about our upcoming slate of films. However, with theaters closed and our production shutdown due to COVID-19, we've had to reschedule a number of release dates for tentpole movies. These include Disney's Mulan for July 24; Marvel's Black Widow for November 6; Pixar's Soul on November 20; and 20th Century's Free Guy set for December 11. As many of you already know, Artemis Fowl, originally slated for a theatrical run, will debut exclusively in Disney+ starting on June 12. As we've said, our company's top priority and our key to our growth is our direct-to-consumer business. And I'm pleased to say that the response to Disney+, in particular, has exceeded even our highest expectations. We have been thrilled with the performance of the service since our initial launch in November, and we continue to expand into other markets. 
In late March, as planned and despite COVID-19, we had an incredibly successful launch of Disney+ in Western Europe, followed by a highly successful launch in India. We announced in early April that in just 5 months, we had surpassed 50 million subscribers globally, a significant milestone for us. We've been quite pleased with the growth that we've seen in the 4 weeks since then, and there's more to come. 
Disney+ will begin rolling out in Japan in June, followed by the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September, and Latin America will follow towards the end of the year. This robust collection of library and original content available on Disney+ continues to grow, including with Disney's Frozen 2 and Pixar's Onward, which were released early as a special offering for families as a shelter-at-home. Yesterday's SVOD premiere of Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker and the new behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of one of Disney+'s most successful series, The Mandalorian, along with the fall premiere of National Geographic's original series, The Right Stuff, based on the book by Tom Wolfe about NASA's Project Mercury. 
This quarter, Hulu saw the successful launch of FX on Hulu. Nearly 45% of Hulu subscribers have accessed library, current and original content from the FX network on the service. Also, Hulu's strong original series continue to perform extremely well, as evidenced by the critically acclaimed hit series, Little Fires Everywhere, amongst others. Hulu had 32 million total subscribers at the end of Q2. We're enormously proud of what we've accomplished to date, and we're optimistic for the future. 
As I said earlier, our businesses have experienced considerable disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This forced us to implement a variety of measures to manage the short and long-term financial impact on our company. The first was a substantial reduction in senior executive compensation company-wide, which will remain in effect until we see a substantive economic recovery. We were fortunate for the first 5 weeks to be able to pay full salaries to those employees who were unable to perform their duties. However, with no way to predict when this crisis will end, we made the very difficult decision to begin furloughs on April 19. Unlike layoffs, the furlough process allows impacted workers to remain as Disney employees while continuing to receive their full health care benefits paid for by the company. We are fully committed to getting our employees back to work as quickly as the current situation allows. While these were not easy decisions, I do believe they have been the right ones given the unprecedented challenges that we're faced with. 
Now before I turn it over to Christine, let me just reiterate what Bob said, and that is Disney is an exceptionally resilient company. With a great management team and thousands of talented and dedicated employees, we continue to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis in a strong position. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine to talk more about the quarter, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions."

These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption",2056,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. These are truly unprecedented times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our company in a number of significant ways. From a financial standpoint, we estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our second quarter operating income was as much as $1.4 billion, with the majority of that impact at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment. As a result, excluding certain items affecting comparability, earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter were $0.60. 
Bob Chapek highlighted a number of steps we have already taken to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial performance. We have also been very focused on strengthening our liquidity position to ensure we have adequate resources to fund our operations during this crisis. 
Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong. Those who have followed the company over the years know that we have historically taken a prudent approach to managing our balance sheet and liquidity. So despite the current business challenges, we believe we start from a position of relative strength. We took proactive and decisive steps during the quarter to further enhance our liquidity position by issuing $6 billion of term debt, which contributed to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $14.3 billion to end the quarter. And a week after the quarter ended, we issued another $925 million in term debt. Last month, we closed on a new $5 billion 364-day bank facility, which, combined with our existing credit facilities of $12.25 billion, provides us with total credit facility capacity of $17.25 billion. I'll note that the $12.25 billion credit facilities also served to backstop our commercial paper program. 
We are evaluating a wide range of scenarios with respect to the potential ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses while prudently managing cash outflows. And overall, we feel confident in our ability to manage through the crisis. We continue to actively evaluate additional mitigation strategies to position our company to emerge from this crisis with the financial flexibility necessary to get back on a growth path. From a cash flow standpoint, the Board has made the decision to forego payment of the semiannual dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which would have been payable in July. This preserves about $1.6 billion in cash, assuming we had held the dividend constant at $0.88 per share. We also identified opportunities to reduce our capital spending, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be about $900 million lower than our prior guidance or $400 million below prior year, driven primarily by paused construction and refurbishment work due to the temporary closing of our parks. While it is still too early to consider more specific implications for capital spending in fiscal 2021, we remain confident in our investment decisions and the resiliency of our businesses. 
Prior to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland, the rest of our parks and experiences businesses were trending well ahead of prior year. As we had previously disclosed, Hong Kong Disneyland faced challenges due to significant declines in visitation from China and other parts of Asia. Attendance at our domestic parks was down 11% in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the Disneyland Resort closed on March 14, and Walt Disney World closed March 16. We estimate the closure of our domestic parks had an adverse impact on attendance growth of approximately 18 percentage points. Per capita guest spending during the period the parks were open was up 13% on higher admissions, merchandise and food and beverage spending. Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 6%, and occupancy was down 16 points to 77%, which reflects a 13% decline in occupied room nights. We estimate the closure of our domestic hotels had an adverse impact on occupied room nights of approximately 15 points. 
As a result of the unprecedented disruptions to our businesses, Q2 operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products was significantly lower compared to Q2 last year. We estimate the disruption to our Parks, Experiences and Products businesses adversely impacted Q2 operating income by approximately $1 billion. As we look ahead, while we've announced plans to reopen Shanghai Disney Resort, there is limited visibility into the timing of reopening and the conditions under which we can reopen the rest of our parks and resorts, cruise ships and Disney stores. However, we believe the strength of our brands and our unwavering commitment to the guest experience are valuable assets that will serve us and our guests well once we reopen. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income was lower in the quarter as higher TV/SVOD distribution results at our legacy film studio were more than offset by higher film impairments, lower worldwide theatrical distribution results at our legacy film studio and a decline in our stage play business due to the impact of COVID-19. Worldwide theatrical results in the quarter were adversely impacted by higher bad debt reserves for receivables due from exhibitors and by lower revenue due to the closure of theaters around the world. In aggregate, the performance of key titles in the quarter, which included Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, was comparable to key theatrical titles in Q2 last year, which included Captain Marvel, Mary Poppins Returns and Dumbo. We feel the performance of Onward was particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic given its release date relative to when theaters began to close. Higher legacy TV/SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including The Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Aladdin, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties. 
The 21CF studio business was a positive contributor in the quarter as higher operating income from TV/SVOD distribution more than offset an operating loss at worldwide theatrical and general and administrative costs. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the second quarter due to higher results at broadcasting as cable operating income was roughly comparable to Q2 last year. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to the consolidation of 21CF, largely reflecting program sales and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our legacy broadcasting operations. The increase at our legacy operations was due to higher affiliate revenue and lower programming and production costs, partially offset by lower program sales from ABC Studios and higher network marketing costs. The decrease in network programming and production costs was due to a timing benefit from new accounting guidance, partially offset by more hours of higher cost specials and a contractual rate increase for the Academy Awards in the current quarter. 
More detail on the new accounting guidance is contained in the 10-Q filing. But I'll note that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expense during the first half of the fiscal year, we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Lower ABC Studios program sales reflect the prior year sale of Jessica Jones and How to Get Away with Murder in Q2 last year. Total broadcasting ad revenue was 3% higher in the quarter, driven by consolidation of 21CF and higher political advertising at our owned stations. Ad revenue at the ABC Network was comparable to Q2 last year. Cable results reflect the consolidation of the 21CF cable businesses, largely offset by a decrease at ESPN, where growth in affiliate revenue was more than offset by higher programming and production costs and lower advertising revenue. Higher programming and production costs at ESPN were primarily driven by contractual rate increases for the college football playoffs and college basketball and costs associated with the launch of the ACC Network. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down approximately 8% in the second quarter as higher rates were more than offset by lower average viewership. Total viewership was negatively impacted by the cancellation of live sporting events in the latter part of the quarter, primarily NBA and college basketball championship week. 
So far this quarter, ESPN's domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing significantly below this time last year, reflecting the current challenges in the marketplace due to the lack of live sports inventory coupled with limited advertiser demand. However, we have seen a couple of bright spots so far this quarter with record viewership for the first 6 episodes of The Last Dance, our highest-rated original documentary of all-time. 
Additionally, the NFL Draft was the most watched ever, reaching more than 55 million viewers over the 3-day event and average audience growth of 58% on ESPN versus last year. The performance of these 2 events suggests there is meaningful pent-up demand from fans for compelling sports programming, and ESPN continues to be well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Total Media Networks affiliate revenue was up 16% and reflects the consolidation of 21CF and growth at both cable and broadcasting. The increase in affiliate revenue was driven by 13 points of growth from the acquisition of 21CF and 7 points from higher rates, partially offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers which benefited by about 2.5 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were $427 million higher in the quarter, driven by costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of Disney+ around the world and the consolidation of Hulu. Disney+ launched in a number of European markets during the quarter, which contributed to a total paid subscriber base of 33.5 million at the end of the quarter. And we are very pleased with the success of our rollout in Western Europe and India, including the execution of previously announced deals with some European platforms to distribute the service to all paid subscribers on certain of their widely distributed tiers and, in India, to convert our preexisting subscription-based Hotstar service to Disney+ Hotstar. 
As we announced on April 8, during the third quarter, we exceeded 50 million Disney+ paid subscribers. More information about those launches is available in our Form 10-Q. Because we executed a number of launches between quarter end and today, we have decided to bring these numbers current. As of May 4, we estimate we had approximately 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers, reflecting a subscriber mix generally similar to our mix at April 8. 
Segment results also reflect the consolidation of an operating loss at Hulu and a benefit from the consolidation of the 21CF international cable businesses. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $500 million, which came in a little better than the guidance we provided last quarter. We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the third quarter. And we expect the continued investment in our DTC services, in particular, Disney+, to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in operating income of our DTC businesses of approximately $420 million. Revenue eliminations increased $1.2 billion and profit eliminations increased $211 million compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by higher intersegment content sales from studio and media networks to DTCI. 
And finally, the 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $460 million in segment operating income in the second quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $200 million. We estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu had a dilutive impact on our Q2 EPS before purchase accounting although it was less dilutive than we expected. This is obviously a very fluid situation. And given the lack of visibility around when some businesses will reopen fully or partially and the conditions under which they reopen, we don't intend to provide specific guidance around our expectations for the remainder of the year. 
These are uncertain times, and our people and businesses are being impacted in significant ways. Despite these near-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our company. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

As you know, we're dealing with a situation that's very fluid. And things are changing. So the results that you saw for the second quarter reflect approximately 2-ish weeks of our domestic parks being closed because we closed Disneyland on the 14th and World on the 16th. And then you had the Asian Parks closed. Shanghai closed fully in January, on the 25th. Hong Kong closed on the 26th. Tokyo, which is a royalty revenue stream that we get, that closed on the 29th. So the $1 billion that was attributable to the parks business and products, for the quarter, just for that second quarter, about $1 billion, you could roughly think of it that the 2 weeks domestic is a little over half. And then you have the Asian -- or the international parks and cruise which are the balance. So when you think about Hong Kong, we already had issues that related to their own domestic issues. So we had already telegraphed that there would be some softness in Hong Kong. And then this closure of the park just accelerated the losses there. And Shanghai had been doing quite well up until the moment that we closed. And I'm going to ask Bob Chapek if he has any other thoughts that he would like to add to that."

And then my second question is just on the studio side of the business. Mulan is one of the first tentpole movies scheduled to be released late July. And I guess are you comfortable with opening that movie to what will most likely be minimal capacity at the theaters? I guess, overall, how much of a consideration is also the international theater openings in your decision to begin to start releasing films in this climate?"

Alexia, in terms of how we look at our park reopenings and what hurdle we need to make to have it make sense, we actually look at it as a positive net contribution to overhead and profit. In other words, it's not about breakeven point for profitability necessarily but just making a positive contribution at the net contribution level. So what we're thinking is that while every site is completely different, that's the approach that we're going to take. And frankly, we would not reopen any park unless we can make at least a positive contribution to that overhead and operating profit level. 
In terms of the second question, in terms of the studio and what type of audiences will Mulan see when it opens up, we're going to get a pretty good idea of that because there's a competitive movie that opens up 1 week before our film does. And at that point, we're hoping that there's some return to a semblance of normal in terms of number of screens that are opening and the number of showtimes for those movies. So our fingers are crossed. Obviously, that's our first big movie out of the gate. But again, between some balance of limited number of seats and theaters as social distancing is practiced by the exhibitors combined with what's got to be an incredible pent-up demand, I think we'll certainly find out and maybe we'll find out a week before with the competitive movie."

So we're going to evaluate each one of our movies on a case-by-case situation, as we are doing right now during this coronavirus situation. I think you know that Artemis Fowl is moving over to Disney+ given the demographics of appeal of that film, which was not originally the plan. And -- but all our other tentpole movies have been rescheduled theatrically for later in the year. So we very much believe in the power of that launch platform for our big movies."

In terms of the future rights and the business models, we think that live sports remain incredibly valuable to us, and we continue to have an interest in live sports rights given the unique slate of assets that we own, with ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC. And we're going to do that, though, as we always have done, in a very disciplined manner. Existing consumer trends play a real big part on how we think about the value of sports rights as they make the transition from linear over to digital. And I think it really -- it's a bit premature to give any specific details on what the strategy is other than we're obviously highly interested in those. And we think we want to make the evolution along with the consumer as they go from linear to digital. 
In terms of the CapEx question, obviously, we had a lot of really big plans in the parks. And we still continue to have big plans. Those good ideas before COVID are going to be really good ideas after. And as Christine said in her opening remarks, there are certain trimmings that we're doing here and there to be responsible from a financial standpoint. But we have such great intellectual property, and our Imagineers over at our theme parks, where the majority of our capital goes, have done such a tremendous job of planning out future experiences for our guests that we're just going to go ahead and take a slightly finer tooth comb, if you will, through those expenditures but essentially plan on investing behind those businesses like we always have. 
And in terms of the cruise ship business, we agree that, that will probably be the last of our travel-oriented businesses to come back online. Interestingly enough, long term, all of our data and our research shows that our guests will be just as interested in cruising with us long term. Obviously, not in the next few months, but much more resilient than any of the competitor businesses because of that love for Disney and assurance that they feel, that they trust our business to act in a responsible way to help, to the extent possible, protect them against some of the woes that have plagued the industry since COVID has hit."

But that being said, and this just builds on some of the things Bob said, this is a business that is one of our highest-rated businesses in terms of guest satisfaction. And it also has a very high intent to repeat the experience. So a lot of people who go on one tend to go back for multiple cruises. So -- and it's also a business when we look at it from an ROI perspective -- ROIC perspective, it's a very nice returning business, creating value long term for shareholders."

In terms of the signals we look for park opening, our hypothesis is because of pent-up demand that if we open up, it's something less than 50% of our standard capacity that we're probably not going to have trouble filling that. So whatever level we state that at, whether it's 10%, 25% or 50% of typical crowds, that's what we'll be able to have at our park. Therefore, we'll staff accordingly to that type of level, whatever that level will be eventually. In terms of optimization and sort of how we'll approach that. Obviously, labor is a huge component of our cost base. And so that will slide with the attendance. And that's why I said when we're looking at the decisions for what that level would be inside the parks and what we're going to be targeting for, it's really looked at as a contribution to net contribution and profit as opposed to saying that we're going to sort of cover the entire or not. Therefore, that gives us the ability to make our decisions on a variable basis and keep as much of that cost structure variable as possible. Obviously, we'll practice the yield strategy overall, just like we always have."

Michael, on the furloughed employees, so the impact that we saw on our parks full segment for Q2 included fully paying everybody. We continued to do that until -- in early April, when we did furlough, company-wide, over 100,000 employees. But most of those employees were in the parks segment by just sheer numbers. So while they are furloughed, we are still paying their portion of their medical benefits. So they're not out-of-pocket for any of their benefits. We thought that was very, very important to do. 
And when we think about our costs too for the parks, we think about it as 3 levels. There's the fixed component, which is depreciation, taxes, property taxes and insurance. The big chunk of that, depreciation, is a noncash item. The other 2, obviously, are cash items. Then you have the variable costs, and those are cost of goods sold, and that's where you do have significant flexibility pretty early on, on the time curve. And then there's another chunk of costs where we would put in labor, and that is what we call semi-fixed. And they're fixed in the short term, just looking at how long it took to do what we had to do to furlough employees. Once again, we're not -- we wouldn't have done it until we had more information that indicated that the parks would be closed for not just a couple of weeks, but we're now in 2 months. And it also includes -- then we have more variable costs in that semi-fixed, and that includes the labor, also SG&A. So we've been taking measures there to eliminate whatever costs we can and other operating expenses. So the furloughed employees will benefit Q3, but we've also done things in the SG&A area that we believe are appropriate given the current state of being closed."

And at that point, there could be some lifting of even those restrictions of the 30%. So those are the metrics there. 
In terms of U.S. park attendees, it really depends on which park you're talking about. Obviously, the Anaheim Park has much more of a drive-in market and a lot less folks that stay overnight, a lot less guests that stay overnight, where Orlando has a big predominance of folks that actually -- families that actually fly in to go visit there.

So in terms of being able to toggle between one outlet and another, whether it's between ABC to ESPN or ESPN to ABC or ESPN to ESPN+, as you know, we've made quite a number of changes given the changes in the environment. And I suspect that we would be able to do that same toggling going forward into the future, depending on what happens in terms of what sports come back, how they come back and look at everything essentially through the lens of our guests and our consumers, how they want to enjoy, how they can enjoy. I also point out to the fact that the NFL Draft was such an unbelievable success for us. And that is a perfect example of being nimble. We had over 3 nights, over 50 million households, which is obviously a huge increase. And I think that speaks volumes to the fact that our cast and our executives over those networks do a phenomenal job of being able to adjust on the fly."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating. And we remain deeply appreciative of the health care workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. 
Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center and ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We have been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established 6 new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion, both in our workforce and creative content. 
As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in-depth about our results for the quarter. 
Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible Phase III opening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo and Orlando as well as our shopping and dining area, Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include: a mandatory mass policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. 
Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN, including the successful resumption of the MBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World Bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. 
When I became CEO in February, I emphasize that we will continue to pursue bold innovation, thoughtful risk-taking and the creative storytelling that is the lifeblood of The Walt Disney Company. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. 
Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically, and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in 9 of the top 10 economies in the world. 
When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and the reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multichannel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans, and then we'll provide you more details and an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline, accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success by combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black Is King, premiered on Disney+ to critical acclaim. It's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the black experience. Both Hamilton and Black Is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. 
And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney Live Actions, The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21; and The Right Stuff, from National Geographic about NASA's project Mercury, which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. A blockbuster series was just honored last week, with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. 
It also bears noting that the Walt Disney company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 prime time Emmy nominations. 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic, and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we'll be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. 
Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it has also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tent-pole film, Mulan, a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers, the Epic Adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently, we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. 
Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers. And to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international, direct-to-consumer, general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, FOX Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand, which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. 
The fact that Disney+ has grown as rapidly as it has, both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content. And through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we are further extending the value of that content internationally. 
Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space. And in light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star Brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward. I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. With that, I'll turn it over to Christine."
191564,674658909,2059225,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08.",1834,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note, this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19 related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion, net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion. While the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. 
As we reopened many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include, but are not limited to incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content, as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our consumer products business due to the effects of COVID-19. 
At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels, and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally and, in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high-quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV SVOD distribution results lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers: Endgame in the prior year quarter. Higher TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including Library Titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both broadcasting and cable. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles, including The Simpsons, Modern Family and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters and the rights cost will be incurred accordingly. Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter, including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23 and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+, which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service; and France via a strategic partnership with Canal Plu; and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. 
At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which, as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU, Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of Cricket in the third quarter, including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League, which we expect to be recognized in future quarters and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior year quarter. 
ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our Direct-to-Consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million, which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million, coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 [ million ] of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as-reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional detail can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. 
We expect our Direct-to-Consumer and International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. 
The 21CF CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu, and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser-focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. we further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rates. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. 
First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA Finals, MLB Playoff and IPL gains all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to a modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences and Products. At Parks, Experiences and Products, it's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing from reopening is less than we'd originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our Consumer Products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. 
Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times, and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

This is obviously a highly uncertain time and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the 6-foot social distancing guidelines would give us. That was 6 weeks before we opened the park when we announced we were opening the park. And then unfortunately, COVID struck again and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long-distance travel jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance, but the other 50% coming from local markets and in state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and made sure that every day, we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing. We just replace local and annual passholders with some of the follow-up that we've necessarily seen from the long distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that -- and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns. And so we're very optimistic about that. But we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time, operating very responsibly."

On our last earnings call, Bob mentioned that we would not be opening a park unless we believe that we could, shortly after opening, generate revenue that exceeded the variable costs.

But right now, it's not as high as we had expected, but we're still in the net positive contribution level.

But doing it under the Star Brand is an interesting twist versus a Hulu. I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for the strategy there and what you're looking at in terms of case of deployment? Anything you can tell us. I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because, obviously, that's big news. And then just following along on direct-to-consumer. Forget about Mulan for a second, but Premier Access as an offering is an interesting strategy. I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription. We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with a kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting. I'm wondering if you're thinking about using that on a regular basis globally on the Disney+ platform."

In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is, of course, Star, and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of you're being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we plan on going into the market. And the first thing is, is that Hulu aggregates third-party content where this will not. This will be rooted in our own content for ABC Studios, FOX TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight, 20th Century. And Hulu also, I must say, has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale then. In terms of the Premier Access idea. As you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and, frankly, to get the quality that we expect from us. And rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give, again, because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform. We thought we would give it a try to establish a new window of Premier Access window to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got. And the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a Premier Access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD, but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+."

So you can expect to hear a fulsome review of the guidance and what we're looking for now because, obviously, things have gone better than expected and we are growing into momentum here. On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan. And it wasn't a full -- I would call it, a limited launch. It was an exclusive alliance that's NTT DOCOMO. That was not -- you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking at a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market because you're absolutely right. There's a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally.

As I mentioned, we will be capitalizing many of those costs that are related to productions, and those will be amortized in future periods. And also in parks, as you've heard from us, there's considerable costs that have been put in place to achieve safety and health measures. And those largely are expensed in the parks."

And we're extremely excited about some of the things that we've got, not only to sustain that linear growth that you talked about for Disney+, but actually go beyond that and grow it.

And these require us to reenter into production but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to, again, not only sustain but continue to grow. And I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and One Division, 3 Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about.

And we all believe that, that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility, given what we were seeing in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year. It would be very late November, early December. And in making the recommendation to the Board, we, again, are going to take into consideration where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having, not only on our financial performance, but what measures we're taking to mitigate COVID impact. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration. And it is part of our overall capital allocation principles. But first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value. And you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the general entertainment channel.

Now I should also say that we think that the Star Brand itself, in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here. We've got a utility that is enabled on all Disney platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star. So that if theoretically, we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+, we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. In terms of the Fox, our -- in terms of the college football and the likelihood that it plays, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on -- the seasons going on because I think that's really up to the lead commissioners.

But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it, and we see COVID continuing for a while. But one of the -- there's a few things that have happened in our businesses and one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people, and we're bringing them back for the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter, you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses.

Is there an alternative state of the world where ESPN could go direct-to-consumers? And have you looked at that model in terms even perspective?"

So the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we were already seeing, and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+. And we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and at the same time, you're seeing a decline in the subscriber MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So you add all those things up. And we're not -- this impairment does not include the value of DTC. That's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels. And so we have, in this calendar -- this fiscal year have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter. And they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now when I say APAC, not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's -- that's where the channels were closed. And we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer. And these channels, shutting them down and taking those platforms direct is certainly what is behind this impairment."

ESPN is the strongest brand in sports and sports continue to be a driver of viewing interest. I think it's evidenced by the fact that sports accounted for over 90 of the 100 most viewed telecast on broadcast and cable in 2019. So we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer? And certainly, you asked whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN. Absolutely, we've looked at everything. And when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now, but as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we may be able to get our programs out to our consumers. And hopefully, we can talk a little bit more about this in our investor conference when we meet in the next few months."

And maybe you could update a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of pricing and occupancy at the hotels as well. And then on Disney+, I'm curious, I mean, you've had this amazing ramp up to the low end of guidance. As you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content? Are you more kind of focused on getting to like more of a plateau with Disney+ and driving it more towards profitability with the content that you've already got planned in the pipeline that's more around the film slate and the Houston characters?"

So when we were talking about the net positive contribution opening up Walt Disney World, what we were referring to was that because there was a surge of COVID in Florida, which limited the amount of inbound travel that we had originally anticipated, so it's more local. That overall is having a little bit of a dampening effect on it, but it's still positive. And once again, it will pick up when there's more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy of the hotel, it's really like there's so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once, I would say, the travel patterns get a little more normalized, and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to, we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers. But right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong. And you could say that, that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while. There's a pent-up demand, and let's not forget that we just opened the full -- the Rise of the Resistance as well as the Star Wars Lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So you had a lot of people and even Floridians, who are just locally who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So the per caps are great. And I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time."

And typically, some of you travels and stays for 5 to 7 days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or 2 and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So the way I would look at it is that it's just as that constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change. But it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. On the Disney+, we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over-rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging. But what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot tentpole content bring to the service and you get that by making investments in new content. So we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service, both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating. And we remain deeply appreciative of the health care workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. 
Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We've been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established 6 new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion, both in our workforce and creative content. 
As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. 
Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo and Orlando as well as our shopping and dining area, Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include: a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. 
Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN, including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World Bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. 
When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation, thoughtful risk-taking and the creative storytelling that is the lifeblood of The Walt Disney Company. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. 
Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically, and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in 9 of the top 10 economies in the world. 
When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multichannel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans, and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline, accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success by combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black Is King, premiered on Disney+ to critical acclaim. It's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the Black experience. Both Hamilton and Black Is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. 
And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions: The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21; and The Right Stuff, from National Geographic about NASA's project Mercury, which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. 
It also bears noting that the Walt Disney company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations. 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic, and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we'll be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. 
Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it has also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film, Mulan, a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers, the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. 
Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. 
Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers. And to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international, direct-to-consumer, general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand, which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. 
The fact that Disney+ has grown as rapidly as it has, both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content. And through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we are further extending the value of that content internationally. 
Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space. And in light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward, and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine."
191564,674658909,2059393,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08",1828,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note, this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion, net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion. While the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. 
As we reopened many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include, but are not limited to, incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions, to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our consumer products business due to the effects of COVID-19. 
At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels, and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally and, in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high-quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers: Endgame in the prior year quarter. Higher TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both broadcasting and cable. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters, and the rights cost will be incurred accordingly. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter, including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23 and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+, which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service; and France via a strategic partnership with Canal+; and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which, as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. 
Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU, Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of Cricket in the third quarter, including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League, which we expect to be recognized in future quarters, and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior year quarter. 
ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million, which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million, coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as-reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional detail can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. 
We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. 
The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser-focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rates. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. 
First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA Finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to a modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences and Products. At Parks, Experiences and Products, it's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing from reopening is less than we'd originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our consumer products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. 
Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times, and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

And then on the parks, I guess any color on how much the accretive opening of Walt Disney World is eating away the losses in the parks. I think you said, Christine, that it's eating away or it's less accretive maybe than you thought it would be initially because of the surge of corona. I'm curious, is that because demand isn't as strong as you thought it would be or because you're just having to keep capacity lower and more careful because of the surge?"

But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of -- as opposed to, say, trying to say that there's some new business windowing model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering, to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering."

This is obviously a highly uncertain time, and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the 6-foot social distancing guidelines would give us. That was 6 weeks before we opened the park, when we announced we were opening the park. And then unfortunately, COVID struck again, and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long-distance travel jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance but the other 50% coming from local markets and in-state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. 
So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and made sure that every day, we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing. We just replace local and annual passholders with some of the falloff that we've necessarily seen from the long-distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that -- and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns. And so we're very optimistic about that. But we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time operating very responsibly."

On our last earnings call, Bob mentioned that we would not be opening a park unless we believe that we could, shortly after opening, generate revenue that exceeded the variable costs.

But doing it under the Star brand is an interesting twist versus a Hulu. I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for the strategy there and what you're looking at in terms of case of deployment. Anything you can tell us. I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because obviously that's big news. 
And then just following along on direct-to-consumer. Forget about Mulan for a second, but premier access as an offering is an interesting strategy. I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription. We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with a kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting. I'm wondering if you're thinking about using that on a regular basis globally on the Disney+ platform."

In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is of course Star, and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of you being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we plan on going into the market. And the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content while this will not. This will be rooted in our own content, from ABC Studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight and 20th Century. And Hulu also, I must say, has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale, Ben. 
In terms of the premier access idea. As you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us. And rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give, again, because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window, a premier access window, to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got. And the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+."

On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan. And it wasn't a full -- I would call it a limited launch. It was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO. So that was not -- you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that as a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market because you're absolutely right, there's a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. 
I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally. And that is going along, even despite COVID, we're still proceeding."

And these require us to reenter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to, again, not only sustain but continue to grow. And I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and WandaVision, 3 Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about.

As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal '20, and that was the payment that would have been made in July. And we all believe that, that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility, given what we were seeing in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year. It would be very late November, early December. And in making the recommendation to the Board, we again are going to take into consideration where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we're taking to mitigate COVID impact. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration. And it is part of our overall capital allocation principles. 
But first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value. And you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the general entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list.

Now I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself, in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here. We've got a utility that is enabled on all Disney platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star. So that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+, we should be able to do it on a Star platform.

We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity. And when we raised that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates, but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when there weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up. And we took the position that get it when we can, and because the demand was so high, we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it, and we see COVID continuing for a while. But one of the -- there's a few things that have happened in our businesses, and one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. 
But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people, and we're bringing them back for the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter, you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know, what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations."

I think you've done a little bit of that in the U.K. with some channels, but could that become a bigger possibility in other markets now that you've written down this asset? 
And then secondly, Bob, from your perspective, when you look at ESPN, obviously, cord-cutting is accelerating, just given what the cable companies have said so far.

So the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we were already seeing, and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+. And we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and with the same time, you're seeing a decline in the subscriber, MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So you add all those things up. And we're not -- this impairment does not include the value of DTC. That's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels. And so we have, in this calendar -- this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter. And they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now when I say APAC, not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed. And we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer. And these channels, shutting them down and taking those platforms direct, is certainly what is behind this impairment."

So we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer? 
And certainly, you asked if whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN. Absolutely. We've looked at everything, and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now. But as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we may be able to get our programs out to our consumers.

And then on Disney+, I'm curious, I mean, you've had this amazing ramp-up to the low end of guidance. As you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content? Are you more kind of focused on getting to like more of a plateau with Disney+ and driving it more towards profitability with the content that you've already got planned in the pipeline that's more around the film slate and the existing characters?"

But it's still positive. And once again, it will pick up when there's more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. 
And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy of the hotel, it's really like there's so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once, I would say, the travel patterns get a little more normalized, and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to, we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers. 
But right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong. And you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while. There's a pent-up demand, and let's not forget that we just opened the full -- the Rise of the Resistance as well as the Star Wars lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So you had a lot of people, even Floridians who are just traveling locally, who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So the per caps are great. And I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time."

And typically, someone who travels and stays for 5 to 7 days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or 2 and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So the way I would look at it is that it's just as that constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change. But it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. 
On the Disney+, we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over-rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging. But what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot tentpole content to bring to the service, and you get that by making investments in new content. So we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service, both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating. And we remain deeply appreciative of the health care workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. 
Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We've been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established 6 new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion, both in our workforce and creative content. 
As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. 
Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo and Orlando as well as our shopping and dining area, Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include: a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. 
Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN, including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World Bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. 
When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation, thoughtful risk-taking and the creative storytelling that is the lifeblood of The Walt Disney Company. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. 
Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically, and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in 9 of the top 10 economies in the world. 
When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multichannel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans, and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline, accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success by combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black Is King, premiered on Disney+ to critical acclaim. It's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the Black experience. Both Hamilton and Black Is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. 
And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions: The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21; and The Right Stuff, from National Geographic about NASA's project Mercury, which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. 
It also bears noting that the Walt Disney company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations. 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic, and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we'll be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. 
Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it has also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film, Mulan, a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers, the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. 
Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. 
Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers. And to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international, direct-to-consumer, general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand, which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. 
The fact that Disney+ has grown as rapidly as it has, both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content. And through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we are further extending the value of that content internationally. 
Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space. And in light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward, and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine."

We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion, net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion. While the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. 
As we reopened many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include, but are not limited to, incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions, to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our consumer products business due to the effects of COVID-19. 
At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels, and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally and, in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high-quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers: Endgame in the prior year quarter. Higher TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both broadcasting and cable. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters, and the rights cost will be incurred accordingly. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter, including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23 and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+, which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service; and France via a strategic partnership with Canal+; and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which, as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. 
Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU, Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of Cricket in the third quarter, including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League, which we expect to be recognized in future quarters, and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior year quarter. 
ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million, which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million, coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as-reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional detail can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. 
We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. 
The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser-focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rates. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. 
First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA Finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to a modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences and Products. At Parks, Experiences and Products, it's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing from reopening is less than we'd originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our consumer products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. 
Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times, and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

And then on the parks, I guess any color on how much the accretive opening of Walt Disney World is eating away the losses in the parks. I think you said, Christine, that it's eating away or it's less accretive maybe than you thought it would be initially because of the surge of corona. I'm curious, is that because demand isn't as strong as you thought it would be or because you're just having to keep capacity lower and more careful because of the surge?"

But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of -- as opposed to, say, trying to say that there's some new business windowing model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering, to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering."

This is obviously a highly uncertain time, and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the 6-foot social distancing guidelines would give us. That was 6 weeks before we opened the park, when we announced we were opening the park. And then unfortunately, COVID struck again, and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long-distance travel jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance but the other 50% coming from local markets and in-state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. 
So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and made sure that every day, we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing. We just replace local and annual passholders with some of the falloff that we've necessarily seen from the long-distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that -- and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns. And so we're very optimistic about that. But we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time operating very responsibly."

I'm wondering if you could just give us a sense for the strategy there and what you're looking at in terms of case of deployment. Anything you can tell us. I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because obviously that's big news. 
And then just following along on direct-to-consumer. Forget about Mulan for a second, but premier access as an offering is an interesting strategy. I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription. We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with a kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting. I'm wondering if you're thinking about using that on a regular basis globally on the Disney+ platform."

In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is of course Star, and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of you being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we plan on going into the market. And the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content while this will not. This will be rooted in our own content, from ABC Studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight and 20th Century. And Hulu also, I must say, has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale, Ben. 
In terms of the premier access idea. As you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us. And rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give, again, because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window, a premier access window, to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got. And the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+."

On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan. And it wasn't a full -- I would call it a limited launch. It was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO. So that was not -- you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that as a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market because you're absolutely right, there's a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan.

And one of the things about Disney+ that we found is that new content to bring -- new content tends to bring in new subscribers, but catalog increases engagement and helps us retain subscribers. So I think that this new content, having so much of this all at once, that I think it's really going to go ahead and propel the business forward. Christine?"

As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal '20, and that was the payment that would have been made in July. And we all believe that, that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility, given what we were seeing in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year. It would be very late November, early December. And in making the recommendation to the Board, we again are going to take into consideration where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we're taking to mitigate COVID impact. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration. And it is part of our overall capital allocation principles. 
But first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value. And you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the general entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list. But we are also looking at other measures like a dividend, but we won't make that decision or recommendation until -- to the Board until the end of the -- close to the end of the calendar year."

In terms of the Star offering that we announced today, we see this as part of a sort of a sequential domino strategy in terms of getting towards an offering on Disney+, starting with the PVOD going through some transactional window after we have an exclusive on Disney+ for the PVOD details to be announced later and then eventually going to Disney+ where it will live in perpetuity. Now I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself, in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here. We've got a utility that is enabled on all Disney platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star. So that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+, we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. 
In terms of the Fox, our -- in terms of the college football and the likelihood that it plays, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on -- the seasons going on because I think that's really up to the league commissioners. That being said, we feel that we've got certain covenants that we have to meet in terms of like programming hours with our partners.

We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity. And when we raised that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates, but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when there weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up. And we took the position that get it when we can, and because the demand was so high, we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it, and we see COVID continuing for a while. But one of the -- there's a few things that have happened in our businesses, and one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. 
But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people, and we're bringing them back for the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter, you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know, what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations."

I think you've done a little bit of that in the U.K. with some channels, but could that become a bigger possibility in other markets now that you've written down this asset? 
And then secondly, Bob, from your perspective, when you look at ESPN, obviously, cord-cutting is accelerating, just given what the cable companies have said so far.

So the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we were already seeing, and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+. And we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and with the same time, you're seeing a decline in the subscriber, MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So you add all those things up. And we're not -- this impairment does not include the value of DTC. That's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels. And so we have, in this calendar -- this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter. And they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now when I say APAC, not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed. And we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer. And these channels, shutting them down and taking those platforms direct, is certainly what is behind this impairment."

So we've got a really strong position from a brand standpoint in a market that consumers love. So then the question is, how do we get it to the consumer? 
And certainly, you asked if whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN. Absolutely. We've looked at everything, and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now. But as that changes over time, we're certainly open to any and all options in terms of how we may be able to get our programs out to our consumers.

And then on Disney+, I'm curious, I mean, you've had this amazing ramp-up to the low end of guidance. As you think about the next stage of growth for Disney+, does it make more sense to kind of go after a bigger market of subscribers, which can be pretty expensive in terms of original content? Are you more kind of focused on getting to like more of a plateau with Disney+ and driving it more towards profitability with the content that you've already got planned in the pipeline that's more around the film slate and the existing characters?"

But it's still positive. And once again, it will pick up when there's more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. 
And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy of the hotel, it's really like there's so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once, I would say, the travel patterns get a little more normalized, and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to, we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers. 
But right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong. And you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while. There's a pent-up demand, and let's not forget that we just opened the full -- the Rise of the Resistance as well as the Star Wars lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So you had a lot of people, even Floridians who are just traveling locally, who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So the per caps are great. And I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time."

And typically, someone who travels and stays for 5 to 7 days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or 2 and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So the way I would look at it is that it's just as that constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change. But it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. 
On the Disney+, we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over-rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging. But what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot tentpole content to bring to the service, and you get that by making investments in new content. So we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service, both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint."

I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. These continue to be challenging times for our world. The impact of the pandemic on people's lives, our communities, businesses and way of life has been devastating. And we remain deeply appreciative of the health care workers, researchers, community leaders and everyone doing their part to get us through this difficult period. 
Along with the challenges posed by the pandemic, the issues of racism and social injustice have also been front and center in ours and the nation's consciousness in recent months. We've been working closely with our employees and cast members in this critical area and have established 6 new strategic pillars to achieve greater diversity and inclusion across the company. We are committed to strongly advancing these initiatives as we strive towards greater representation and inclusion, both in our workforce and creative content. 
As you know, the majority of businesses worldwide have experienced unprecedented disruption as a result of the pandemic. Most of our businesses were shut down, and this had a huge impact on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.08 a share compared to $1.34 a share last year. Christine will talk more in depth about our results for the quarter. 
Despite the harsh realities we are facing today, we have made some encouraging progress. Since our last earnings call, we've begun a responsible phased reopening of our parks in Shanghai, Paris, Tokyo and Orlando as well as our shopping and dining area, Downtown Disney in Anaheim. We have prioritized the health and safety of our cast members and guests and have instituted protocols that include: a mandatory mask policy, temperature screenings, increased cleaning and disinfecting as well as capacity restrictions to promote social distancing. We continue to work with national and local health and government officials in this very fluid situation and are making adjustments as necessary. 
Along with millions of fans, we're also pleased with the return of major live sports on ESPN, including the successful resumption of the NBA and MLS seasons within the Walt Disney World Bubble and restarts of the WNBA and MLB. Another positive development to note has been the initial restarting of some of our television and film productions, both domestically and overseas. 
When I became CEO in February, I emphasized that we will continue to pursue bold innovation, thoughtful risk-taking and the creative storytelling that is the lifeblood of The Walt Disney Company. And despite the challenges of the pandemic, we've managed to take deliberate and innovative steps in running our businesses. At the same time, we've also been very focused on advancing and growing our direct-to-consumer business, which we see as our top priority and key to the future of our company. 
Last November, we successfully launched Disney+ domestically, and we've since rolled it out in a number of major international markets, including Western Europe, India and Japan. I am also incredibly pleased to announce that, as of yesterday, we have surpassed 60.5 million paid subscribers globally, far exceeding our initial projections for the service. As our global sub numbers continue to grow, we've also exceeded our internal subscriber projections in every major market we've launched thus far. The tremendous success of Disney+ in less than a year clearly establishes us as a major force in the global direct-to-consumer space. We will continue our international expansion with the launch of Disney+ in the Nordics, Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal in September and in Latin America this November. And I'm happy to announce that we will also be rolling out Disney+ Hotstar on September 5 in Indonesia, one of the world's most populous countries. By year-end, Disney+ will be available in 9 of the top 10 economies in the world. 
When you look across our full portfolio of direct-to-consumer businesses at Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, our combined global reach now exceeds an astounding 100 million paid subscriptions. This is a significant milestone and a reaffirmation of our strategy for growth. In fact, the incredible success we've achieved to date has made us even more confident about the future of our direct-to-consumer business and our ability to be more aggressive in our approach. Going forward, this confidence, coupled with the trends we're seeing in the multichannel universe, will lead us to pursue even more innovative and bold initiatives as we continue to grow the business. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to share with you some of our upcoming plans, and then we'll provide you more details at an investor presentation that we will host in the upcoming months. We've already demonstrated an aggressive approach to our content creation pipeline, accelerating the Disney+ debuts of Frozen 2, Pixar's Onward and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Fast-tracking the debut of Broadway's Hamilton to Disney+, which has been a huge success by combining the best elements of live theater, film and streaming, we have given millions of viewers a whole new way to experience this iconic cultural phenomenon. And last week, Beyonce's visual album, Black Is King, premiered on Disney+ to critical acclaim. It's being widely celebrated for its diverse cast, stunning artistry and inspiring interpretation of the Black experience. Both Hamilton and Black Is King have clearly shown the power of the Disney+ platform for premiering world-class content. 
And there's more great content coming to the service. Highlights include Disney live actions: The One and Only Ivan, which will stream exclusively on the service beginning August 21; and The Right Stuff, from National Geographic about NASA's project Mercury, which is set to premiere this fall. And millions of fans are anxiously awaiting the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian in October. The blockbuster series was just honored last week with an incredible 15 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, a first for a debut streaming service. 
It also bears noting that the Walt Disney company's television, cable, studio productions and streaming entities received an impressive 145 Primetime Emmy nominations. 92 were for programming content produced by our entities, which really speaks to the power of our creative engines across the company. As I said earlier, we've been able to begin resuming some of our creative pipeline activities amidst the pandemic, and we're confident that when we can fully resume operations, we'll be able to do so in a meaningful way with some of the best creative teams and most popular franchises in the industry. 
Like many companies, we've had to find innovative ways to conduct our business during the pandemic. While we view this as a devastating situation for everyone affected, it has also forced us to consider different approaches and look for new opportunities. In the process, we're discovering ways to better serve our consumers during this challenging period. Unfortunately, we've had to delay the release of Disney's highly anticipated tentpole film, Mulan, a number of times due to the impact of COVID on theaters. In order to meet the needs of consumers during this unpredictable period, we thought it was important to find alternative ways to bring this exceptional family-friendly film to them in a timely manner. We are announcing today that in most Disney+ markets, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of countries in Western Europe, we will be offering Disney+ subscribers, the epic adventure Mulan on Disney+ on a premier access basis beginning September 4. The price point will be $29.99 in the U.S. and will vary slightly in other countries. 
Simultaneously, we will be releasing the film theatrically in certain markets where currently we have no announced launch plans for Disney+ and where theaters are open. We see this as an opportunity to bring this incredible film to a broad audience currently unable to go to movie theaters, while also further enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Disney+ subscription with this great content. 
Given the rapid changes in consumer behavior, we believe it is more important than ever that we continue to grow our direct relationship with our customers. And to this end, I am also pleased to announce that we plan to launch an international, direct-to-consumer, general entertainment offering under the Star brand in calendar year 2021. Mirroring the strategy we successfully pursued with Disney+, the offering will be rooted in content we own from the prolific and critically acclaimed production engines and libraries of ABC Studios, Fox Television, FX, Freeform, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight. In many markets, the offering will be fully integrated into our established Disney+ platform from both a marketing and a technology perspective, and it will be distributed under the Star brand, which has been successfully utilized by the company for other general entertainment platform launches, particularly with Disney+ Hotstar in India. 
The fact that Disney+ has grown as rapidly as it has, both domestically and globally, clearly demonstrates the value of our content. And through the addition of our Star-branded general entertainment offering, we are further extending the value of that content internationally. 
Let me reiterate that we see tremendous opportunity in the direct-to-consumer space. And in light of the success that we've achieved thus far with our global direct-to-consumer business and bolstered by our ability to deliver the exceptional brands, franchises and storytelling that consumers around the world have demonstrated a tremendous affinity for, we intend to take full advantage of that opportunity. To this end, as I mentioned, we will be hosting another Investor Day in the coming months, focused on our plans to accelerate the push into the direct-to-consumer marketplace across our Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star brands. Personally, I am as optimistic as I could be about our way forward, and I'm excited to share more about our plans with you in the coming months. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Christine."
191564,674658909,2080015,"The Walt Disney Company, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2020",2020-08-04,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08",1828,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. 
As Bob mentioned, our financial results in the fiscal third quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, this quarter's diluted earnings per share were $0.08. I'll note, this is the first quarter where results in both the current and prior year period reflect a full quarter of operations from the 21CF assets we acquired. We estimate the adverse impact of COVID-19-related disruption on our third quarter segment operating income was approximately $3 billion, net of cost mitigations. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was the most severely affected with an adverse impact of $3.5 billion. While the puts and takes across our other businesses aggregated to a net benefit as lower revenues were generally offset by the benefit of cost deferrals and cost reductions. We expect many of these cost deferrals to reverse in future quarters due primarily to the timing shift of sporting events. 
As we reopened many of our businesses, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to addressing the safety of our cast members, talent and guests as well as various government regulations. These include, but are not limited to, incremental costs as it relates to responsibly resuming production of film and television content as well as the enhanced measures we have put into place at our parks and resorts. We estimate that through the end of fiscal 2021, these incremental cash costs could total approximately $1 billion. We expect many of these expenditures, particularly those related to restarting productions, to be capitalized and amortized over future periods. 
At Parks, Experiences and Products, third quarter results largely reflect the closures of our domestic parks and resorts, cruise line business and Disneyland Paris for the entirety of the quarter. Our Shanghai and Hong Kong resorts were also closed for part of the quarter with Shanghai reopening on May 11 and Hong Kong reopening on June 18. However, Hong Kong was subsequently closed July 15 due to a government order. As a result of these widespread disruptions, operating results at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of about $2 billion. These results also reflect an adverse impact at our consumer products business due to the effects of COVID-19. 
At Walt Disney World, we are achieving our objective of driving a positive net contribution at current attendance levels, and we expect demand will grow when the COVID situation in Florida improves. We are also closely monitoring trends at our reopened sites internationally and, in particular, have been pleased with what we've seen at Shanghai since reopening in May. While uncertainty still exists regarding the timing for reopening some of our businesses, we remain committed to creating high-quality experiences for all of our guests and are confident in our ability to generate long-term value through these assets. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter as higher TV SVOD distribution results, lower home entertainment marketing costs and lower film impairments were more than offset by lower theatrical distribution results. Worldwide theatrical results were adversely impacted by COVID-19. Given the closure of theaters, both domestically and internationally, no significant titles were released in the quarter. This resulted in a difficult comparison against the outstanding performance of Avengers: Endgame in the prior year quarter. Higher TV SVOD results were driven by content sales to Disney+, including library titles, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Onward, partially offset by a decrease in sales to third parties in the pay window. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the third quarter due to higher results at both broadcasting and cable. At broadcasting, the increase in operating income was due to lower programming and production costs, an increase in affiliate revenue, higher program sales and lower marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising revenue. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely due to production shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, partially offset by a timing impact from new accounting guidance. You may recall that while the new accounting guidance resulted in lower programming and production expenses during the first half of the fiscal year, we have said that we expect programming and production expenses to be higher in the second half of the year as capitalized costs are amortized. 
Higher programming sales in the quarter were driven by titles including The Simpsons, Modern Family and The Politician. Total broadcasting ad revenue was down 17% in the quarter, driven by decreases at our owned television stations and the ABC Network. Higher results at cable networks are primarily due to increases at ESPN and FX networks. ESPN benefited from lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, higher affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. FX Networks benefited from lower marketing and programming costs. At ESPN, lower programming and production costs were largely due to the deferral of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball. We currently expect these games to be played in future quarters, and the rights cost will be incurred accordingly. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was down significantly in the third quarter due to the impact of COVID-19 and the absence of the NBA and other significant live sports programming. Several live sporting events have already returned to ESPN this quarter, including Major League Soccer on July 8, Major League Baseball on July 23 and the NBA just last Friday. Assuming the resumption of live sports continues as planned, we expect ESPN's ad sales in Q4, including the benefit of the 53rd week, to benefit significantly, particularly from the NBA. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 2%. This was driven by 7 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers, which benefited by about 2 points due to the launch of the ACC Network. 
At our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment, operating losses were approximately $140 million higher in the quarter compared to last year, driven by costs associated with the launch of Disney+, which expanded into several new markets during the third quarter, partially offset by improved results at Star and ESPN+. During the third quarter, we launched Disney+ in India via our Disney+ Hotstar service; and France via a strategic partnership with Canal+; and in Japan via a limited launch with NTT DOCOMO. At the end of the quarter, Disney+ had a paid subscriber base of 57.5 million, which, as Bob mentioned, has now grown to 60.5 million as of August 3. 
Given the unique nature of our India offering, it's worth noting that Disney+ Hotstar comprised about 15% of our quarter-end subscribers. As it relates to ARPU, Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.62. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.31. At Star, higher results reflect lower programming costs, partially offset by lower advertising revenue. Both of these drivers reflect the absence of Cricket in the third quarter, including a shift in rights costs for the Indian Premier League, which we expect to be recognized in future quarters, and the absence of costs for the quadrennial ICC World Cup which aired in the prior year quarter. 
ESPN+ operating results improved versus the prior year quarter due to subscriber growth and an increase in UFC pay-per-view income. Results at our direct-to-consumer businesses had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of about $200 million, which came in better than the guidance we provided last quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected results at Disney+ and Hulu. This outperformance, along with lower-than-expected expenses at our international channels, contributed to the segment's overall operating loss of approximately $700 million, coming in better than our prior guidance. Note that our third quarter segment results at DTCI excluded approximately $5 billion of impairment charges related to our international channels business, which is included in our calculation of as-reported earnings per share. These impairment charges reflect the underperformance of these assets due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of our accelerated push into direct-to-consumer streaming services in the midst of declines in our international MVPD subscriber base. Additional detail can be found in our 10-Q, which we expect to file shortly. 
We expect our Direct-to-Consumer & International segment to generate about $1.1 billion in operating losses for the fourth quarter. And we expect the Q4 operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter, driven by lower losses at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by our continued investment in Disney+. 
The 21CF businesses we acquired, excluding 21CF's stake in Hulu and net of intersegment eliminations, contributed approximately $730 million in segment operating income in the third quarter. Consolidating Hulu's operating losses and netting out intersegment eliminations resulted in a positive contribution to total segment operating income of about $490 million. While some of our affected businesses have reopened, we remain laser-focused on prudently managing our cash outflows and preserving liquidity. We further strengthened our capital position during the quarter by issuing $11 billion of term debt in May at highly attractive rates. And we reduced our commercial paper balances by close to $2 billion during the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with $23 billion in cash and continue to feel we are well positioned to navigate through this time of uncertainty and continue to invest in the long-term future growth of our businesses. As we look ahead, there are a handful of items that we would like to give you an update on. 
First, you may recall that our fiscal 2020 calendar has an extra week of operations. This year, we expect that 53rd week will actually have a modest adverse impact on operating results in Q4 due to our current expectations of NBA Finals, MLB playoffs and IPL games all occurring in the 53rd week, in addition to a modest operating loss at Parks, Experiences and Products. At Parks, Experiences and Products, it's worth noting that while Walt Disney World is operating at a positive net contribution level, the upside we are seeing from reopening is less than we'd originally expected given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Florida. We also anticipate Q4 results at our consumer products business will reflect a difficult comparison to Frozen and Star Wars merchandise sales in the prior year quarter as well as the ongoing disruption of retail operations caused by COVID-19. 
Finally, we have continued to refine our capital spending plan, and we now expect total CapEx for fiscal 2020 to be approximately $700 million lower than prior year, largely due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts. These are certainly fluid times, and we are proud of our management team and cast members for going above and beyond to position our company well for a very exciting future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we will be happy to take your questions."

And then on the parks, I guess any color on how much the accretive opening of Walt Disney World is eating away the losses in the parks. I think you said, Christine, that it's eating away or it's less accretive maybe than you thought it would be initially because of the surge of corona.

But we're looking at Mulan as a one-off in terms of -- as opposed to, say, trying to say that there's some new business windowing model that we're looking at. So Mulan is a one-off. That said, we find it very interesting to be able to take a new offering, our premier access offering, to consumers at that $29.99 price and learn from it and see what happens not only in terms of the uptake of the number of subscribers that we get on the platform but the actual number of transactions on the Disney+ platform that we get on that PVOD offering."

This is obviously a highly uncertain time, and we could tell from our reservation stream that we had ample demand to go above what the 6-foot social distancing guidelines would give us. That was 6 weeks before we opened the park, when we announced we were opening the park. And then unfortunately, COVID struck again, and all the numbers started going up. This gave some level of trepidation to travelers who are anxious about long-distance travel jumping on a plane and flying to Walt Disney World. So what we've seen is that we have roughly 50% of our guest base still traveling from a distance but the other 50% coming from local markets and in-state. We've also had a higher-than-expected level of cancellations once somebody does make a reservation because as the disease ebbs and flows, they might necessarily cancel. 
So what we've done is used our strategy for yielding and made sure that every day, we're pretty close to the percentage of the park that we can fill and still maintain the social distancing. We just replace local and annual passholders with some of the falloff that we've necessarily seen from the long-distance travelers. I will say that our research indicates that -- and our bookings indicate that we should be in good shape once consumer confidence sort of returns. And so we're very optimistic about that. But we're very happy that we're returning a positive net contribution, as Christine said, because that was our goal in the first place, while at the same time operating very responsibly."

I'm sure there's a lot coming in the Investor Day about that strategy because obviously that's big news. 
And then just following along on direct-to-consumer. Forget about Mulan for a second, but premier access as an offering is an interesting strategy. I'm just wondering what your research tells you about that approach versus offering more content as part of the Disney+ subscription. We haven't seen sort of this idea of subscription service with a kind of a pay-per-view element on top of it, which is really interesting.

In terms of the general entertainment offering internationally, we want to mirror our successful Disney+ strategy by using our Disney+ technical platform, rooting it in content that we already own and distributing it under a successful international brand that we also already own, which is of course Star, and then bringing it to market in a very close association to Disney. I think in terms of you being surprised that this isn't being launched under a different brand name, I think it's important to look at the differences in how we plan on going into the market. And the first thing is that Hulu aggregates third-party content while this will not. This will be rooted in our own content, from ABC Studios, Fox TV, FX, Freeform, Searchlight and 20th Century. And Hulu also, I must say, has no brand awareness outside of the U.S. and nor does Hulu have any content that's been licensed to it internationally. So this gives us the ability to market this under the Disney umbrella and have synergies with our existing platform. So that's our basic rationale, Ben. 
In terms of the premier access idea. As you probably know, Disney tentpole blockbuster theatrical films can be fairly expensive to make and produce in order to get the quality that consumers expect from us and frankly to get the quality that we expect from us. And rather than simply rolling it into a free offering, we thought we would give, again, because we can test almost anything when you have your own platform, we thought we would give it a try to establish a new window, a premier access window, to try to recapture some of that investment that we've got. And the good news, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is that we're going to have a chance to learn from this and to see whether that makes sense. All I'll say about our research is that it shows that such an offering under a premier access offering not only gets us revenue from the original transaction from the PVOD but also acts as a fairly large stimulus to sign up for Disney+."

So on updating guidance, we're in the process now of working through our long-term plan just because of COVID and all the disruption to our businesses. It's a little bit delayed from a typical calendar schedule. But we are not going to update piecemeal, we're going to give you a full update of the guidance we provided at the original Investor Day when we do the upcoming Investor Day in a few months. So you can expect to hear a fulsome review of the guidance and what we're looking for now because obviously things have gone better than expected, and we are growing into momentum here. 
On Japan, Disney+ launched on June 11 in Japan. And it wasn't a full -- I would call it a limited launch. It was an exclusive alliance with NTT DOCOMO. So that was not -- you had to be an NTT DOCOMO subscriber in order to have that ability. So you shouldn't be looking that as a full country launch. So I think you can anticipate that once it is launched, there will be more demand for Disney+ in that market because you're absolutely right, there's a very, very high affinity for the Disney brand in Japan. 
I think you also had a question on Fox synergies. We are still on track to achieve the synergies that we had discussed originally. And that is going along, even despite COVID, we're still proceeding."

And that's a variety of things. It's everything from ramping up productions. And you can imagine these productions, they have everything from distancing that you have to accommodate for, site preparation, stage preparation, all the testing that has to go on. So there's a lot of increased costs, and what those also will result in is increased days to produce episodes. So all of those things will incur costs. As I mentioned, we will be capitalizing many of those costs that are related to productions, and those will be amortized in future periods. And also in parks, as you've heard from us, there's considerable costs that have been put in place to achieve safety and health measures. And those largely are expensed in the parks."

And we're extremely excited about some of the things that we've got not only to sustain that linear growth that you talked about for Disney+ but actually go beyond that and grow it. We've got of course the Mandalorian 2, which we've announced is coming in October, but we've also got a slew of Marvel content that's going to be coming that we're very excited about. And these require us to reenter into production, but it's such a priority that we're hopeful that this will be coming shortly to enable us to, again, not only sustain but continue to grow. And I would tell you that the content is fabulous, Loki, Falcon and Winter Soldier and WandaVision, 3 Marvel properties that we're really, really excited about. 
And one of the things about Disney+ that we found is that new content to bring -- new content tends to bring in new subscribers, but catalog increases engagement and helps us retain subscribers. So I think that this new content, having so much of this all at once, that I think it's really going to go ahead and propel the business forward. Christine?"

As you know, management recommended and the Board decided to accept that recommendation not to pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal '20, and that was the payment that would have been made in July. And we all believe that, that decision provided the company with additional financial flexibility, given what we were seeing in the COVID environment we're in and all the uncertainty that we're dealing with and continue to deal with. So our Board would typically determine whether or not to declare a dividend for the second half of fiscal '20 in the latter part of the calendar year. It would be very late November, early December. And in making the recommendation to the Board, we again are going to take into consideration where we are with COVID and the impact that it's having not only on our financial performance but what measures we're taking to mitigate COVID impact. So we'll take the full financial picture into consideration. And it is part of our overall capital allocation principles. 
But first and foremost, we are going to invest in businesses that we believe are going to drive long-term shareholder value. And you're seeing what we're doing in the direct-to-consumer initiatives not only domestically with Disney+, internationally with Disney+ and now internationally with the general entertainment channel. So we feel like that's certainly top of the list. But we are also looking at other measures like a dividend, but we won't make that decision or recommendation until -- to the Board until the end of the -- close to the end of the calendar year."

Now I should also say that we think that the Star brand itself, in terms of its offerings, we've got a utility here. We've got a utility that is enabled on all Disney platforms. I did mention to you that we will have the ability to use the same platform across both Disney+ and Star. So that if theoretically we can afford to do something on one particular platform like Disney+, we should be able to do it on a Star platform. It's not something we've talked about or entertained, but the capability is there. 
In terms of the Fox, our -- in terms of the college football and the likelihood that it plays, I don't really want to comment on the possibility of us going on -- the seasons going on because I think that's really up to the league commissioners.

We do take somewhat of a conservative approach to managing liquidity. And when we raised that money, it was back in March and April, we were able to achieve some pretty favorable interest rates, but we also did not have any visibility into how long this environment was going to continue. We also saw some weeks in the spring when there weren't consistent capital markets conditions. So you'd have some weeks when spreads gapped out, sometimes they tighten up. And we took the position that get it when we can, and because the demand was so high, we decided to take it because we view it somewhat as an insurance policy. But when we look at the overall balance sheet, we have it, and we see COVID continuing for a while. But one of the -- there's a few things that have happened in our businesses, and one is just the way that we have probably been much better at cost mitigation than we anticipated. The whole company is aligned towards tightening the belt. And we've done, I think, a great job on that. 
But as we are opening up the parks, remember now, we furloughed over 100,000 people, and we're bringing them back for the most part, not all are back yet, but a lot are back. So we will be spending more money just in terms of labor than we did in the third quarter. So in the fourth quarter, you'll see some of our costs actually go up to resume some of our businesses. So I look at this as, as we all know, what kills the company is the lack of liquidity. And as a CFO, I would never want to be in that position of not being able to fund all of our obligations."

So the best way I would frame it is this impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we were already seeing, and then that was exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19. Coupled with that, we've learned a lot with the launch of Disney+. And we have, as you've heard today, accelerated our push into DTC consumer streaming and with the same time, you're seeing a decline in the subscriber, MVPD subscriber base outside of the U.S. So you add all those things up. And we're not -- this impairment does not include the value of DTC. That's intact. What this impairment is about is the linear channels. And so we have, in this calendar -- this fiscal year, have already closed down more than 20 channels. Most of those were closed in this third quarter. And they were primarily in APAC and in EMEA. Now when I say APAC, not in India, these are in other parts of Asia. But that's where the channels were closed. And we're taking a look at going more quickly, as you said, into direct-to-consumer. And these channels, shutting them down and taking those platforms direct, is certainly what is behind this impairment."

And certainly, you asked if whether we've looked at a stronger direct-to-consumer proposition for ESPN. Absolutely. We've looked at everything, and when we think that we've got the most effective way to maximize shareholder value from the brand, the way we are right now.

But it's still positive. And once again, it will pick up when there's more regular travel patterns going into Walt Disney World. 
And as it relates to sort of pricing and occupancy of the hotel, it's really like there's so many hotels that are not yet reopened. And so those are kind of meaningless numbers right now. So once, I would say, the travel patterns get a little more normalized, and we see people going in and staying for regular vacations like they used to, we'll be providing occupancy and booking numbers. 
But right now, the one thing I would add is per caps are very, very strong. And you could say that that's probably because people haven't been in the parks for a while. There's a pent-up demand, and let's not forget that we just opened the full -- the Rise of the Resistance as well as the Star Wars lands fully in the beginning of this calendar year. So you had a lot of people, even Floridians who are just traveling locally, who have not yet had an opportunity to go in and experience that. So the per caps are great. And I think it's because people haven't been able to get into our parks for quite a long time."

And typically, someone who travels and stays for 5 to 7 days is marginally more valuable to the business than someone who comes in on an annual pass and stays a day or 2 and consumes less merchandise and food and beverage. So the way I would look at it is that it's just as that constituency changes a little bit, so do our overall margins change. But it's not because of price reductions or anything like that. And I think Christine handled the pricing and occupancy in hotels. 
On the Disney+, we absolutely are going after a bigger market of the number of subscribers as opposed to over-rotating to try to get to a profitability number much sooner than we thought. Although I must say the prospect of us hitting our goals as quickly as we are is very encouraging. But what we plan to do is invest even more in our content in order to keep that machine cranked and going. As I mentioned, one of the biggest things in terms of subscriber acquisition is having new hot tentpole content to bring to the service, and you get that by making investments in new content. So we'll be investing in content first and then trying to grow the service, both from a marketing standpoint and from an installed base standpoint."

Despite the m",1438,"Thanks, Lowell, and good afternoon, everyone. As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect back on the year, I think we'd all agree it's been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes and certainly in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Despite the many challenges and hardships, I'm proud to say we have been steadfast in effectively managing our businesses under enormously difficult circumstances. We haven't just persevered during these tough times. We've also taken a number of deliberate steps and smart risks that have positioned our company for greater long-term growth. And the impressive resilience Disney has demonstrated while looking past today's challenges to set the stage for an even brighter future is a direct reflection of our outstanding team. They've done and continue to do an admirable job balancing the needs of our cast, our shareholders and our guests. 
Of course, the real bright spot amidst the pandemic has been our Direct-to-Consumer business. 1 year ago today, we launched Disney+, and it has quickly exceeded our highest expectations. We have since rolled out the service in more than 20 countries worldwide. And on Tuesday, we will launch in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina followed by more overseas markets in the coming year. 
The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we've launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high-quality entertainment, both original and library content. And I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers, far surpassing our expectations in just its first year, and we're continuing to see positive trends. During our Investor Day presentation on December 10, we will provide an update of our global subscriber numbers. 
The growth of Disney+ speaks volumes about the strength of our IP, our unparalleled brands and franchises and our amazing content creators, all part of the Disney difference that sets us apart from everyone else. And when you look across our full suite of streaming service, we have exceeded 120 million paid subscriptions worldwide, with impressive subscriber gains for ESPN+ and Hulu, including the rapidly growing Hulu + Live TV. We expect the international launch of our Star-branded general entertainment offering will enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead. 
Given that our DTC business is key to the future growth of our company, we've restructured our media and entertainment businesses. By separating content creation from distribution, we've been able to streamline our processes and better align the organization towards these important strategic objectives as we accelerate our pivot to a DTC-first business model. We intend to build upon the success we've achieved thus far and look forward to sharing more of our plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day. 
While the pandemic continues to impact our company, resulting in an adjusted loss of $0.20 a share in the fourth quarter, the prolonged situation has prompted us to find new and innovative ways to deal with the difficult and often unpredictable challenges we're facing. We successfully made adjustments and have resumed many of our operations, clearly demonstrating the resiliency The Walt Disney Company is known for. 
While many of our productions were shut down beginning in March due to COVID, our animation teams were able to work remotely and have continued production uninterrupted during the pandemic. We were also fortunate to keep other parts of our creative pipeline active and to continue post-production work for our Media Networks, studios and Disney+. 
We've been able to develop processes and institute health and safety measures that have made it possible to resume live-action production as well. Of course, the unpredictability of COVID may result in unforeseen impacts to current and future productions. 
On the studio side, we have restarted or completed production on all of the projects previously impacted by COVID, including ones from our Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Disney Live-Action and Lucasfilm, and we anticipate having 8 new projects up and running by January. 
On TV side, we now have more than 100 live-action scripted and unscripted projects in active production with dozens more in various stages of pre or post production. Across all platforms, there has been a great response to our content. A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian to rave reviews and incredible social buzz. There's been much excitement surrounding the announcement that Disney Pixar's Soul will be debuting on Disney+ on Christmas Day. 
And on the broadcasting side, ABC is now ranked #1, delivering some of the most popular and most watched shows on television, including Dancing with the Stars and The Conners. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our incredible local and national ABC News teams for the outstanding work they continue to do under very difficult circumstances. They've been working around the clock making sure viewers nationwide have access to the most important and accurate information, particularly as it pertains to the COVID pandemic. And they've also done an outstanding job reporting on the election in an informative and balanced way. From Good Morning America holding its spot as the #1 morning news cast for the eighth straight year to World News Tonight with David Muir consistently ranking as the #1 evening newscast as well as the #1 program on all broadcast cable television in the U.S. over the summer, there is no question, ABC News is America's #1 news source. 
On the park side, we've proven over many months that we're able to operate our parks responsibly following strictly enforced guidelines provided by health care experts, successfully reopening our parks in Orlando, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We've also reopened Disneyland Paris for several months, although the resort is now temporarily closed due to President Macron's recent lockdown order in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in Europe. 
People have shown a willingness to visit our parks, which I believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the measures we've taken. And we are very encouraged by the positive news earlier this week on the progress of potential vaccines. 
Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed that the State of California continues to keep Disneyland closed despite our proven track record. Our health and safety protocols are all science-based and have the support of labor unions representing 99% of our hourly cast members. 
Frankly, as we and other civic leaders have stated before, we believe state leadership should look objectively at what we've achieved successfully at our parks around the world, all based on science as opposed to setting an arbitrary standard that is precluding our cast members from getting back to work while decimating small businesses in the local community. 
Our ability to operate responsibly in this pandemic environment extends beyond our theme parks. I'm proud to say that we were successfully able to host the NBA and MLS at Walt Disney World in Orlando. It's been a huge undertaking and a great achievement. Just consider the NBA, for example: 94 days, 22 teams, 172 games, players, broadcast partners, referees, media, support staff and Disney employees, all in the bubble. 
It was also a big win for ESPN, which broadcast the games, along with a packed schedule of other sports offerings, including the WNBA, college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. As you look at the most watched cable shows on TV this year, more than half have been live sports, proving that sports are a powerful draw despite the disruption of the pandemic. 
ESPN Digital and ESPN+ have also performed exceptionally well, with September being the best month ever for ESPN streaming video. ESPN+ continues its positive subscriber growth, reaching more than 10 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter, nearly tripling in size over the past year. 
As you can see, even during these most uncertain times, here's The Walt Disney Company. We are finding ways to not only operate our businesses effectively but also take the necessary bold steps for our future growth. 
And we are more committed than ever to investing in our businesses, in particular, our DTC strategy, which we see as the key driver of significant long-term value for our company. We look forward to sharing details of our plans with you at our Investor Day next month. We also can't wait for you to see the extraordinary content that's being created for our full portfolio of streaming services: Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. It's just fantastic. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine."
191564,690787531,2140692,"The Walt Disney Company, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 12, 2020",2020-11-12,"Earnings Calls","The Walt Disney Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20, and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued to",1914,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20, and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued to reflect significant impacts from COVID-19, which we estimate adversely impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $3.1 billion. 
Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was again the most severely affected with an estimated adverse impact of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We estimate that Media Networks operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $500 million due to COVID largely due to higher rights costs at ESPN associated with programming in the fourth quarter that was delayed from prior quarters. 
Another factor that affected our Q4 results was the 53rd week. While last quarter we guided to the 53rd week having a modest adverse impact on operating results, the additional week of operations actually resulted in a benefit. There were a few reasons behind this variance, but the largest driver was related to the timing of sports rights costs. 
I'll now turn to our results by segment. At Parks, Experiences and Products, financial results in the quarter were significantly impacted by restricted capacity and closures. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $1.1 billion. This reflects the closures of Disneyland Resort in California and our cruise line business for the entirety of the quarter. 
Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the full quarter after reopening in May, while Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris reopened in mid-July. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for a couple of weeks at the beginning and end of the quarter. 
All of our reopened parks and resorts were operating at significantly reduced capacities during Q4. However, we are pleased to report that Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland all achieved a net positive contribution in the quarter, which means we generated revenue that exceeded the variable costs associated with reopening. 
At Walt Disney World, we are also encouraged by the booking trends we are seeing. Park reservations at our reduced capacity limits are already 77% booked for Q1 with Thanksgiving week booked close to capacity. These trends provide us with further confidence around underlying consumer demand for our parks and experiences. 
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 as theaters were closed in many key markets, both domestically and internationally. With no significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a difficult comparison against the strong performance of the Lion King and Toy Story 4 in the prior year quarter. The decrease was partially offset by lower marketing expenses. 
Lower home entertainment results were driven by lower unit sales, also partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Unit sales were lower in the quarter as there were no comparable releases versus the prior year performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin and Captain Marvel. 
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the fourth quarter due to higher results at Broadcasting, partially offset by lower results at Cable Networks. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was primarily due to affiliate revenue growth and lower programming, production and marketing costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns and cancellations of network programming, the shift of college football games to fiscal 2021 and a delay in airing new season premieres. 
Lower results at Cable Networks were driven by decreases at ESPN, partially offset by increases at FX networks and the domestic Disney channels. ESPN results were lower as affiliate and advertising revenue growth were more than offset by higher programming and production costs. 
At ESPN, higher programming and production costs were largely due to COVID-related shifts of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball into the fourth quarter. This included 2 NBA finals games and 16 MLB postseason games that fell into the 53rd week. 
Total ESPN advertising revenue was up 26% in the fourth quarter, including the benefit of the 53rd week. The return of live sports events drove higher rates, slightly offset by viewership declines. So far this quarter, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing below the prior year primarily due to shifts in college football schedules, particularly for the Big 10 and the Pac 12. Given the timing of programming remaining in the quarter, we currently expect that ESPN advertising revenue will end the first quarter higher versus the prior year. 
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 12% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points from the 53rd week and 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The decrease in subscribers benefited by about 2 points from the launch of the ATC Network. 
At Direct-to-Consumer & International, an operating loss of $580 million in the quarter was an improvement of approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. This improvement was driven by higher results at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by costs associated with the ongoing rollout of Disney+ and a decrease at our international channels. 
At Hulu, the improvement was primarily due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. The improvement at ESPN+ was due to subscriber growth as well as increased pay-per-view income from UFC events. 
Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 36.6 million paid subscribers, and ESPN+ ended the quarter with 10.3 million paid subscribers. Disney+ ended Q4 with 73.7 million paid subscribers or an increase of over 16 million subscribers versus Q3. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions were the largest contributor to this increase driven by the start of the delayed IPL season. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers now account for a little over 1/4 of our global subscriber base. 
Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.52. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.30. On our last earnings call, we said that we expected the fourth quarter operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter. Our results came in better than that guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300 million versus the prior year due to better-than-expected performance across all 3 of our streaming services. 
I will note that we do not plan to further update any of our subscriber numbers until our Investor Day on December 10. At our international channels, lower results were due to lower affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in costs. 
Switching gears, I want to take a moment to give you an update on our 21CF acquisition. We previously stated our expectation that the deal would be accretive to EPS, excluding the impact of purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. While COVID certainly had an impact on these numbers, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu were accretive in both Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. 
As a practical matter, given our recent reorganization and the successful and complete integration of these assets into The Walt Disney Company, it is no longer practical nor do we believe it would be insightful into our businesses to break out 21CF performance. Therefore, we do not intend to discuss legacy Fox results or accretion on a go-forward basis. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, while our liquidity position remains strong, we are continuing to manage our leverage with a long-term commitment to return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. As part of that commitment and given limited visibility due to COVID and our decision to prioritize investment in our DTC initiatives, the Board has decided to forego payment of a semiannual dividend in January 2021. 
Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize investing in the growth of our businesses, particularly in the direct-to-consumer space. However, we anticipate the payment of a dividend will remain a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy following the return to a normalized operating environment. 
As we look forward, we expect that our results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our visibility is limited and will be influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the recovery of theatrical exhibition, confidence in consumer travel and the continued resumption of live sports. 
But as we sit here today, there are a few items we would like to highlight that may help frame expectations for the first quarter. Our Parks and Experiences business continues to be impacted by COVID-19, and we do not have visibility into how long these impacts will last. While some of our parks are open with limited capacity, we currently anticipate Disneyland Resort will remain closed at least through the end of the fiscal first quarter. Disneyland Paris is also currently closed. 
Because we have no significant tentpole theatrical releases planned for Q1, we expect that our theatrical results will be meaningfully below the prior year, during which we released Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2. We also anticipate that home entertainment, stage play and studio TV SVOD results will be meaningfully lower year-over-year. 
Similarly, at Consumer Products, we expect merchandise licensing results in Q1 to be adversely impacted due to comparisons versus Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in the prior year. At ESPN, first quarter results will be significantly impacted by higher rights and production costs due to the shift of 4 NBA finals games and 3 additional college football playoff games into quarter, along with incremental regular season college football rights costs shifting into the quarter. This impact is partially offset by an expected delayed start to the 2020-2021 NBA season. 
We expect the Q1 operating results of our DTC businesses to decline by approximate $100 million relative to the prior year quarter driven by continued investment in Disney+, partially offset by improved results at both ESPN+ and Hulu. At our international channels business, we expect first quarter operating results to decline by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter driven by a combination of higher sports rights costs due to timing shifts, COVID-related impacts and channel closures. 
Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were approximately $4 billion, down about $850 million from the prior year due to decreased spending at our domestic parks and resorts. We expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be $550 million higher versus fiscal year 2020 due to increased investments at our media and entertainment distribution businesses and at corporate, partially offset by reduced spending at Parks, Experiences and Products. 
As we've previously noted, we will start reporting under our new organizational structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. While our reporting segments will change, we intend to provide key financial and supplemental information, including much of what we report today, particularly as it relates to our Direct-to-Consumer businesses. As always, our goal is to provide the needed transparency into our businesses. We remain very excited about our future, and we also look forward to sharing more details on our evolving DTC strategy at our December 10 virtual Investor Day. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

You'd announced some cost cuts, but I wondered if the company is taking a fresh look at their content rights needs and if there's any kind of update on the willingness to maybe cut back on some of the rights you've had previously? How do you think about that? 
And then secondly for whoever you want to send it to, over the years, Disney made a pretty smart decision to cut back the number of films they release every year to focus on quality and franchises. And I just wonder now with the reorganization and the new game plan at DTC, how will kind of the quality of the franchises and the content output be managed as it's increased, right? So it looks like it's a change in terms of the output of the organization. Just want to hear about the quality management of that."

Michael, in terms of ESPN and the cost cuts, we are obviously watching our costs across all of our operating units very carefully in light of the adversity that we're facing with the pandemic. But long term, as we look at our content rights, we're looking at it from a shareholder standpoint. If it's accretive to shareholder value, then there are decisions that we make going forward in terms of looking at new rights as they expire and what we want to put on to our service. So we're being very deliberate, and we're being very careful and analyzing everything to make sure that it would be something that would be additive to us. 
And I might say that we've got very good relationships with all the leagues, and it's important. We continue to believe in sports. As a matter of fact, in 2019, 93 of the top 100 programs in viewership on television were sports. And as you know, we've got the most trusted brand out there in the world in terms of sports. So we believe that's a nice recipe for future success, but we realize that the world is changing, and there's a lot of dynamics at play, but we'll only do continue rights deals as long as they add shareholder value. 
In terms of the second question, in terms of the -- looking at the number of films and the amount of content that we put into the system, you're right. Over time, we've been very, very discriminate in terms of what types of films we make and how many we make. And I think that's really benefited the company. 
We're in a world, though, now in a subscription business where we're managing churn. And we've got a unique combination of assets in this company that are all at play right now in Disney+, where we've not only got the most desirable library in the world, but we realize, and that really helps, by the way, minimize churn, but we also realize that new content that we put add subscribers. It's very clear to us that new content adds subscribers. So I think you'll see a continued increase in investment in our direct-to-consumer platforms and that will then fuel some of the growth that Christine will talk about at the investor conference that we expect on December 10."

So any thoughts there?

And as you remember, that was our very first foray into a strategy like premier access. Unfortunately, that title met with some controversy, both in the U.S. and internationally, shortly after we released it. But we saw enough very positive results before that controversy started to know that we've got something here in terms of the premier access strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the investor conference in December. 
In terms of Soul, we also realized, though, that part of the lifeblood of Disney+ is providing great content to the base level subscribers that are in there in premier or in Disney+. And so the idea is that we thought it was a really nice gesture to our subscribers to take Soul during the holiday period and provide that as part of the service. 
But I think what we've learned with Mulan on is that there's going to be a role for it strategically with our portfolio of offerings. And again, we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference in December. 
In terms of our opportunities to continue to improve parks, we're actually very encouraged by what we're seeing right now in our parks across the world. There's really 2 dynamics that are going on. Number one, our partner operators, which, as you know, are the best in the world, are becoming much more efficient and effective operating under COVID guidelines. And we've been able to pretty materially increase our capacity and still stay within the guidelines that local governments are giving us, for example, 6-foot social distancing. And this is happening across our parks across the world. 
In fact, Walt Disney World, which was at a 25% capacity constraint, which was our industrial engineering estimates to keep 6-foot social distancing now has been able to increase to 35% of capacity. So almost a 50% increase in the number of guests that we can allow in and still adhere to the local guidelines and the guidelines that are stipulated by the CDC with the 6-foot social distancing. So we're very pleased by how we've become adept at operating under these constraints. 
But the second thing that's even more encouraging is the demanding -- demand that's growing for our parks across the world. I think it says 2 different things. Number one, shows the love that guests have for our experiences that we have within our parks and the tremendous IP that we have as a company have. But I also think it speaks to the trust that people have, given the track record that we now have after months of operating across the globe with very stringent guidelines. And we're very pleased with our track record. And I think people are now, through forward bookings and reservations, showing some very encouraging signs about their willingness to come and spend time with us at a Disney park."

And then probably for Bob. Bob, I know you're saving a lot for December 10, but you announced a pretty substantial reorganization of the company in a year that's obviously already had a lot of disruption, particularly around the Direct-to-Consumer business with Kevin leaving, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your motivation there, kind of the reaction you've gotten from your senior executives. Many have had their roles shifted pretty substantially, including giving up kind of P&L accountability. I was wondering if you could talk about your confidence that you -- you're going to get what you want out of this from a company perspective and that you can manage the risk of separating content production decisions from monetization decisions because it's a pretty substantial change."

And we did meet -- actually, we exceeded that $2 billion number. And so we feel really good about the momentum we have on the efficiency side. And we're also going to take the opportunity to continue looking for operational efficiencies. 
The one thing we've learned in this COVID environment is there are ways of being more efficient, and we'll continue to mine those. And it actually has really helped us not only in segments like our parks business that are directly impacted but throughout the entire company. So we'll continue to drive towards greater efficiencies. 
And when the -- you asked about how much do we incur in the restructuring charges related to Fox. Overall, Fox restructuring charges were $1.7 billion. And $1.2 billion of that was incurred in fiscal '19. So $500 million was done this year. And in this quarter, where we had about a little under $400 million of restructuring charges, a portion of that was also populated. It comes out to about a little over 30 -- a little less than 30%. So the balance was related to our cuts at -- reductions in force at parks."

I think we have 100% buy in because we have clarity on accountability, which everyone really likes. And we separate out roles to what people tend to do best. 
Content does what they do best and same with distribution. So distribution, who manages the P&L, will set the parameters for our annual and long-term budget framework that's been agreed to on the slate with the content creators. And then the content creators then green light the individual projects that then shepherd development and production. So essentially, distribution is now able to optimize the commercialization without maybe too much unnecessary regard for legacy distribution platforms. But at the same time, our creatives, who, as you know, are the best in the world, are really free to do what they do. And that's just make the best content and storytelling possible. A lot of collaboration between the 2 groups, but ultimately, some level of independence in terms of each being what they can be and doing their jobs best."

In terms of sports ratings, sports ratings, we feel that in context of everything that's happening, are actually holding up quite well. But we would be careful not to draw any conclusions about the ultimate health of sports, sort of the long-term impact that you suggested during this pandemic. We really think that we're sort of looking at apples and oranges here. 
I think the best comp we probably have is the NFL, which has been relatively flat. Our Monday night football viewership has been down 4%, relatively modest despite all the headwinds. I mean, we've got the risk of seasons not finishing. To your point, we don't have fans in the stands. We have the risk of games individually every week being canceled. We have election news as competition. And we really can't have our fans doing what they like to do the best, which is watch in a communal setting. They pretty much are watching by themselves. 
Despite all those headwinds, the fact that our Monday night football business is relatively flat in terms of viewership is really, I think, really encouraging. And if you adjust, if you will, viewership over the last couple of months for the amount of available content, you see that they kind of slide together. So we actually don't have any concerns about the long-term health of sports. Obviously, we've got some headwinds as it pertains to short-term challenges and hurdles. But we think that all in all, in context, the health of sports is pretty decent, given everything that's going on. 
In terms of India, obviously, we have an executive there, Uday Shankar, who we love, and we wish him well. He gave us some indication several months ago that he was thinking of moving on. We've got a really deep bench there. And we feel that we have all kinds of opportunities and a lot of success so far with Disney+. And we have no reason to believe that, that success won't continue and even accelerate going forward."

But the main question is, having re-upped some Disney+ distribution deals, what changes are you seeing now, now that you are of the uncertain launch phase and the value on both sides is better defined for you and for the distributor, does the economics of those deals change? Or should we think about the cost of that marketing channel as locked in?

And they really entail some really high hurdles in terms of not only testing by the potential guests that we host on the ships but also a process that has to happen in order to certify our first sailings. Those will necessarily result in delays beyond what we had hoped in terms of getting our ships back in service and making magic for our guests. 
I guess the best news out of all of it is that we now do see some light at the end of the tunnel. I think we have an opportunity to create sort of a Disney bubble, if you want -- if you would, on each one of our cruise ships. And demand is very, very strong for our cruise ships. We're seeing extremely strong demand in the back half of FY '21 and all of '22 in terms of of bookings. 
That said, that then creates the demand for the new ships that you asked about. And right now, we're anticipating delivering our first new ship, The Wish, in summer of '22. And then we have our next 2 ships in '24 and '25. And so after a slight delay of roughly 6 months on those ships, we think that we're going to be able to bring them on to service. We hope and expect that the world will back to normal by then and anticipate having a fine time trying to fill up the demand of those ships. And we think there's going to be so much pent-up demand that we don't expect to have much issues, given the love that our guests have for Disney Cruise Lines. 
In terms of the distribution deals and sort of the changing the landscape over time with those, we're really pleased with our partnerships to date. We try to limit them. We don't do too many, but we use them to strategically pursue growth of our subscriber base and lower subscriber acquisition costs. So as you know, we have 1 or 2 of these in each market. That's about it. But it really does help us sort of provide a base during our growth phase, and we've got full flexibility over time to either ramp those up or ramp those down as we see fit."

And of course, we've got our linear networks that we're managing. We've made some reductions just this last week at ESPN as we manage the transition from linear to more of a digital experience and direct-to-consumer experience.

I'm a personal big fan of it. I use it. And it's really slick. It's very elegant, and it really is a big solution provider. It's really the complete solution, I think.

As we close out the fourth quarter and reflect back on the year, I think we'd all agree it's been a year unlike any other in our lifetimes and certainly in the history of The Walt Disney Company. Despite the many challenges and hardships, I'm proud to say we have been steadfast in effectively managing our businesses under enormously difficult circumstances. We haven't just persevered during these tough times. We've also taken a number of deliberate steps and smart risks that have positioned our company for greater long-term growth. And the impressive resilience Disney has demonstrated while looking past today's challenges to set the stage for an even brighter future is a direct reflection of our outstanding team. They've done and continue to do an admirable job balancing the needs of our cast, our shareholders and our guests.  
Of course, the real bright spot amidst the pandemic has been our direct-to-consumer business. 1 year ago today, we launched Disney+, and it has quickly exceeded our highest expectations. We have since rolled out the service in more than 20 countries worldwide. And on Tuesday, we will launch in Latin America, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina followed by more overseas markets in the coming year. The response from consumers has been overwhelmingly positive. Everywhere that we've launched Disney+, audiences have embraced the wide array of high-quality entertainment, both original and library content. And I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the fourth quarter, Disney+ had more than 73 million paid subscribers, far surpassing our expectations in just its first year, and we're continuing to see positive trends. During our Investor Day presentation on December 10, we will provide an update of our global subscriber numbers.  
The growth of Disney+ speaks volumes about the strength of our IP, our unparalleled brands and franchises and our amazing content creators, all part of the Disney difference that sets us apart from everyone else. And when you look across our full suite of streaming service, we have exceeded 120 million paid subscriptions worldwide, with impressive subscriber gains for ESPN+ and Hulu, including the rapidly growing Hulu + Live TV. We expect the international launch of our Star-branded general entertainment offering will enable us to grow our business even further in the years ahead. Given that our DTC business is key to the future growth of our company, we've restructured our media and entertainment businesses. By separating content creation from distribution, we've been able to streamline our processes and better align the organization towards these important strategic objectives as we accelerate our pivot to a DTC-first business model. We intend to build upon the success we've achieved thus far and look forward to sharing more of our plans with you at our upcoming Investor Day.  
While the pandemic continues to impact our company, resulting in an adjusted loss of $0.20 a share in the fourth quarter, the prolonged situation has prompted us to find new and innovative ways to deal with the difficult and often unpredictable challenges we're facing. We successfully made adjustments and have resumed many of our operations, clearly demonstrating the resiliency The Walt Disney Company is known for.  
While many of our productions were shut down beginning in March due to COVID, our animation teams were able to work remotely and have continued production uninterrupted during the pandemic. We were also fortunate to keep other parts of our creative pipeline active and to continue post-production work for our Media Networks studios and Disney+. We've been able to develop processes and institute health and safety measures that have made it possible to resume live-action production as well. Of course, the unpredictability of COVID may result in unforeseen impacts to current and future productions. 
On the studio side, we have restarted or completed production on all of the projects previously impacted by COVID, including ones from our Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Disney Live Action and Lucasfilm, and we anticipate having 8 new projects up and running by January. 
On the TV side, we now have more than 100 live-action scripted and unscripted projects in active production with dozens more in various stages of pre- or post-production. Across all platforms, there has been a great response to our content. A couple of weeks ago, we rolled out the highly anticipated second season of The Mandalorian to rave reviews and incredible social buzz. There's been much excitement surrounding the announcement that Disney/Pixar's Soul will be debuting on Disney+ on Christmas Day.
And on the broadcasting side, ABC is now ranked #1, delivering some of the most popular and most watched shows on television, including Dancing with the Stars and The Conners. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our incredible local and national ABC News teams for the outstanding work they continue to do under very difficult circumstances. They've been working around the clock, making sure viewers nationwide have access to the most important and accurate information particularly as it pertains to the COVID pandemic. And they've also done an outstanding job reporting on the election in an informative and balanced way. From Good Morning America holding its spot as the #1 morning newscast for the eighth straight year to World News Tonight with David Muir consistently ranking as the #1 evening newscast as well as the #1 program on all broadcast and cable television in the U.S. over the summer, there is no question ABC News is America's #1 news source.  
On the park side, we've proven over many months that we're able to operate our parks responsibly, following strictly enforced guidelines provided by health care experts, successfully reopening our parks in Orlando, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong. We've also reopened Disneyland Paris for several months, although the resort is now temporarily closed due to President Macron's recent lockdown order in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in Europe. People have shown a willingness to visit our parks, which I believe is a testament to the fact that they feel confident in the measures we've taken. And we are very encouraged by the positive news earlier this week on the progress of potential vaccines. Unfortunately, we are extremely disappointed that the State of California continues to keep Disneyland closed despite our proven track record. Our health and safety protocols are all science-based and have the support of labor unions representing 99% of our hourly cast members. Frankly, as we and other civic leaders have stated before, we believe state leadership should look objectively at what we've achieved successfully at our parks around the world all based on science as opposed to setting an arbitrary standard that is precluding our cast members from getting back to work while decimating small businesses in the local community.  
Our ability to operate responsibly in this pandemic environment extends beyond our theme parks. I'm proud to say that we were successfully able to host the NBA and MLS at Walt Disney World in Orlando. It's been a huge undertaking and a great achievement. Just consider the NBA for example: 94 days, 22 teams, 172 games, players, broadcast partners, referees, media, support staff and Disney employees all in the bubble. It was also a big win for ESPN, which broadcast the games along with a packed schedule of other sports offerings, including the WNBA, college football, Major League Baseball and the NFL. As you look at the most watched cable shows on TV this year, more than half have been live sports, proving that sports are a powerful draw despite the disruption of the pandemic. ESPN Digital and ESPN+ have also performed exceptionally well, with September being the best month ever for ESPN streaming video. ESPN+ continues its positive subscriber growth, reaching more than 10 million paid subscribers as of the end of the quarter, nearly tripling in size over the past year.  
As you can see, even during these most uncertain times, here at The Walt Disney Company, we are finding ways to not only operate our businesses effectively but also take the necessary bold steps for our future growth. And we are more committed than ever to investing in our businesses, in particular our DTC strategy, which we see as the key driver of significant long-term value for our company. We look forward to sharing details of our plans with you at our Investor Day next month. We also can't wait for you to see the extraordinary content that's being created for our full portfolio of streaming services, Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Star. It's just fantastic.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to Christine."

Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20, and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. Our financial results continued",1914,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the fiscal fourth quarter's diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.20, and our full year fiscal 2020 diluted EPS was $2.02. 
Our financial results continued to reflect significant impacts from COVID-19, which we estimate adversely impacted segment operating income in Q4 by $3.1 billion. Our Parks, Experiences and Products segment was again the most severely affected with an estimated adverse impact of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. We estimate that Media Networks operating income was negatively impacted by approximately $500 million due to COVID largely due to higher rights costs at ESPN associated with programming in the fourth quarter that was delayed from prior quarters.  
Another factor that affected our Q4 results was the 53rd week. While last quarter we guided to the 53rd week having a modest adverse impact on operating results, the additional week of operations actually resulted in a benefit. There were a few reasons behind this variance, but the largest driver was related to the timing of sports rights costs.  
I'll now turn to our results by segment. At Parks, Experiences and Products, financial results in the quarter were significantly impacted by restricted capacity and closures. Operating income at Parks, Experiences and Products declined significantly versus the prior year to an operating loss of $1.1 billion. This reflects the closures of Disneyland Resort in California and our cruise line business for the entirety of the quarter. Shanghai Disney Resort was open for the full quarter after reopening in May, while Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Paris reopened in mid-July. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort was opened for a couple of weeks at the beginning and end of the quarter. 
All of our reopened parks and resorts were operating at significantly reduced capacities during Q4. However, we are pleased to report that Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland all achieved a net positive contribution in the quarter, which means we generated revenue that exceeded the variable costs associated with reopening. At Walt Disney World, we are also encouraged by the booking trends we are seeing. Park reservations at our reduced capacity limits are already 77% booked for Q1, with Thanksgiving week booked close to capacity. These trends provide us with further confidence around underlying consumer demand for our parks and experiences.  
At Studio Entertainment, operating income decreased in the quarter due to lower theatrical distribution and home entertainment results. Worldwide theatrical results continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 as theaters were closed in many key markets, both domestically and internationally. With no significant worldwide theatrical releases in the quarter, we faced a difficult comparison against the strong performance of The Lion King and Toy Story 4 in the prior year quarter. The decrease was partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Lower home entertainment results were driven by lower unit sales, also partially offset by lower marketing expenses. Unit sales were lower in the quarter as there were no comparable releases versus the prior year performance of Avengers: Endgame, Aladdin and Captain Marvel.  
Turning to Media Networks. Operating income was up in the fourth quarter due to higher results at Broadcasting, partially offset by lower results at Cable Networks. At Broadcasting, the increase in operating income was primarily due to affiliate revenue growth and lower programming, production and marketing costs. The decrease in programming and production costs was largely driven by COVID-19-related production shutdowns and cancellations of network programming, the shift of college football games to fiscal 2021 and a delay in airing new season premieres. Lower results at Cable Networks were driven by decreases at ESPN, partially offset by increases at FX Networks and the Domestic Disney Channels. ESPN results were lower as affiliate and advertising revenue growth were more than offset by higher programming and production costs.  
At ESPN, higher programming and production costs were largely due to COVID-related shifts of rights costs for the NBA and Major League Baseball into the fourth quarter. This included 2 NBA Finals games and 16 MLB postseason games that fell into the 53rd week. Total ESPN advertising revenue was up 26% in the fourth quarter, including the benefit of the 53rd week. The return of live sports events drove higher rates, slightly offset by viewership declines. So far this quarter, ESPN domestic linear cash ad sales are pacing below the prior year primarily due to shifts in college football schedules particularly for the Big Ten and the Pac-12. Given the timing of programming remaining in the quarter, we currently expect that ESPN advertising revenue will end the first quarter higher versus the prior year.  
Total Media Networks affiliate revenue increased 12% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points from the 53rd week and 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers. The decrease in subscribers benefited by about 2 points from the launch of the ACC Network. 
At Direct-to-Consumer & International, an operating loss of $580 million in the quarter was an improvement of approximately $170 million compared to the prior year. This improvement was driven by higher results at Hulu and ESPN+, partially offset by costs associated with the ongoing rollout of Disney+ and a decrease at our international channels. At Hulu, the improvement was primarily due to both subscriber and advertising revenue growth, partially offset by higher programming and production costs. The improvement at ESPN+ was due to subscriber growth as well as increased pay-per-view income from UFC events. 
Hulu ended the fourth quarter with 36.6 million paid subscribers, and ESPN+ ended the quarter with 10.3 million paid subscribers. Disney+ ended Q4 with 73.7 million paid subscribers or an increase of over 16 million subscribers versus Q3. Disney+ Hotstar subscriber additions were the largest contributor to this increase, driven by the start of the delayed IPL season. Disney+ Hotstar subscribers now account for a little over 1/4 of our global subscriber base. Disney+'s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.52. However, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $5.30. 
On our last earnings call, we said that we expected the fourth quarter operating results of our DTC businesses to improve by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter. Our results came in better than that guidance, with operating income at our DTC businesses improving by approximately $300 million versus the prior year due to better-than-expected performance across all 3 of our streaming services. I will note that we do not plan to further update any of our subscriber numbers until our Investor Day on December 10. At our international channels, lower results were due to lower affiliate and advertising revenues, partially offset by a decrease in costs. 
Switching gears. I want to take a moment to give you an update on our 21CF acquisition. We previously stated our expectation that the deal would be accretive to EPS, excluding the impact of purchase accounting for fiscal 2021. While COVID certainly had an impact on these numbers, we estimate the acquisition of 21CF and the impact of taking full operational control of Hulu were accretive in both Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of purchase accounting. As a practical matter, given our recent reorganization and the successful and complete integration of these assets into The Walt Disney Company, it is no longer practical nor do we believe it would be insightful into our businesses to break out 21CF performance. Therefore, we do not intend to discuss legacy Fox results or accretion on a go-forward basis. 
As we've discussed on prior calls, while our liquidity position remains strong, we are continuing to manage our leverage with a long-term commitment to return to levels consistent with a single A credit rating. As part of that commitment and given limited visibility due to COVID and our decision to prioritize investment in our DTC initiatives, the Board has decided to forego payment of a semiannual dividend in January 2021. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize investing in the growth of our businesses, particularly in the direct-to-consumer space. However, we anticipate the payment of a dividend will remain a part of our long-term capital allocation strategy following the return to a normalized operating environment. 
As we look forward, we expect that our results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Our visibility is limited and will be influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the recovery of theatrical exhibition, confidence in consumer travel and the continued resumption of live sports. But as we sit here today, there are a few items we would like to highlight that may help frame expectations for the first quarter. 
Our parks and experiences business continues to be impacted by COVID-19, and we do not have visibility into how long these impacts will last. While some of our parks are open with limited capacity, we currently anticipate Disneyland Resort will remain closed at least through the end of the fiscal first quarter. Disneyland Paris is also currently closed. 
Because we have no significant tentpole theatrical releases planned for Q1, we expect that our theatrical results will be meaningfully below the prior year, during which we released Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2. We also anticipate that home entertainment, stage play and studio TV SVOD results will be meaningfully lower year-over-year. Similarly, at consumer products, we expect merchandise licensing results in Q1 to be adversely impacted due to comparisons versus Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in the prior year. 
At ESPN, first quarter results will be significantly impacted by higher rights and production costs due to the shift of 4 NBA Finals games and 3 additional college football playoff games into quarter, along with incremental regular season college football rights costs shifting into the quarter. This impact is partially offset by an expected delayed start to the 2020-2021 NBA season. 
We expect the Q1 operating results of our DTC businesses to decline by approximately $100 million relative to the prior year quarter driven by continued investment in Disney+, partially offset by improved results at both ESPN+ and Hulu. At our international channels business, we expect first quarter operating results to decline by approximately $300 million versus the prior year quarter driven by a combination of higher sports rights costs due to timing shifts, COVID-related impacts and channel closures. 
Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 were approximately $4 billion, down about $850 million from the prior year due to decreased spending at our domestic parks and resorts. We expect CapEx in fiscal year 2021 to be $550 million higher versus fiscal year 2020 due to increased investments at our media and entertainment distribution businesses and at corporate, partially offset by reduced spending at Parks, Experiences and Products. 
As we've previously noted, we will start reporting under our new organizational structure in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. While our reporting segments will change, we intend to provide key financial and supplemental information, including much of what we report today, particularly as it relates to our direct-to-consumer businesses. As always, our goal is to provide the needed transparency into our businesses. We remain very excited about our future, and we also look forward to sharing more details on our evolving DTC strategy at our December 10 virtual Investor Day. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions."

How do you think about that? 
And then secondly for whoever you want to send it to, over the years, Disney made a pretty smart decision to cut back the number of films they release every year to focus on quality and franchises. And I just wonder now with the reorganization and the new game plan at DTC, how will kind of the quality of the franchises and the content output be managed as it's increased, right?

Michael, in terms of ESPN and the cost cuts, we are obviously watching our costs across all of our operating units very carefully in light of the adversity that we're facing with the pandemic. But long term, as we look at our content right needs, we're looking at it from a shareholder standpoint. If it's accretive to shareholder value, then there are decisions that we make going forward in terms of looking at new rights as they expire and what we want to put on to our service. So we're being very deliberate and we're being very careful and analyzing everything to make sure that it would be something that would be additive to us. And I might say that we've got very good relationships with all the leagues, and it's important. We continue to believe in sports. As a matter of fact, in 2019, 93 of the top 100 programs in viewership on television were sports. And as you know, we've got the most trusted brand out there in the world in terms of sports. So we believe that's a nice recipe for future success, but we realize that the world is changing and there's a lot of dynamics at play, but we'll only do continue rights deals as long as they add shareholder value. 
In terms of the second question in terms of the -- looking at the number of films and the amount of content that we put into the system, you're right. Over time, we've been very, very discriminate in terms of what types of films we make and how many we make. And I think that's really benefited the company. We're in a world though now in a subscription business where we're managing churn. And we've got a unique combination of assets in this company that are all at play right now in Disney+, where we've not only got the most desirable library in the world but we realize -- and that really helps, by the way, minimize churn, but we also realize that new content that we put add subscribers. It's very clear to us that new content adds subscribers. So I think you'll see a continued increase in investment in our direct-to-consumer platforms, and that will then fuel some of the growth that Christine will talk about at the investor conference that we expect on December 10."

And as you remember, that was our very first foray into a strategy like premier access. Unfortunately, that title met with some controversy, both in the U.S. and internationally, shortly after we released it. But we saw enough very positive results before that controversy started to know that we've got something here in terms of the premier access strategy. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the investor conference in December. In terms of Soul, we also realized though that part of the lifeblood of Disney+ is providing great content to the base-level subscribers that are in there in premier -- or in Disney+. And so the idea is that we thought it was a really nice gesture to our subscribers to take Soul during the holiday period and provide that as part of the service. But I think what we've learned with Mulan is that there's going to be a role for it strategically with our portfolio of offerings. And again, we're going to talk more about that at the investor conference in December. 
In terms of our opportunities to continue to improve parks, we're actually very encouraged by what we're seeing right now in our parks across the world. There's really 2 dynamics that are going on. Number one, our park operators, which, as you know, are the best in the world, are becoming much more efficient and effective in operating under COVID guidelines. And we've been able to pretty materially increase our capacity and still stay within the guidelines that local governments are giving us, for example, 6-foot social distancing. And this is happening across our parks across the world. In fact, Walt Disney World, which was at a 25% capacity constraint, which was our industrial engineering estimates to keep 6-foot social distancing, now has been able to increase to 35% of capacity, so almost a 50% increase in the number of guests that we can allow in and still adhere to the local guidelines and the guidelines that are stipulated by the CDC with the 6-foot social distancing. So we're very pleased by how we've become adept at operating under these constraints. 
But the second thing that's even more encouraging is the demanding -- demand that's growing for our parks across the world. I think it says 2 different things: number one, shows the love that guests have for our experiences that we have within our parks and the tremendous IP that we have -- as a company have; but I also think it speaks to the trust that people have, given the track record that we now have after months of operating across the globe with very stringent guidelines. And we're very pleased with our track record. And I think people are now, through forward bookings and reservations, showing some very encouraging signs about their willingness to come and spend time with us at a Disney park."

And then probably for Bob. Bob, I know you're saving a lot for December 10, but you announced a pretty substantial reorganization of the company in a year that's obviously already had a lot of disruption particularly around the direct-to-consumer business with Kevin leaving, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your motivation there, kind of the reaction you've gotten from your senior executives. Many have had their roles shift pretty substantially, including giving up kind of P&L accountability. Just wondering if you could talk about your confidence that you're going to get what you want out of this from a company perspective and that you can manage the risk of separating content production decisions from monetization decisions because it's a pretty substantial change."

And we're also going to take the opportunity to continue looking for operational efficiencies. The one thing we've learned in this COVID environment is there are ways of being more efficient, and we'll continue to mine those. And it actually has really helped us not only in segments like our parks business that are directly impacted but throughout the entire company. So we'll continue to drive towards greater efficiencies. 
And with the -- you asked about how much do we incur in the restructuring charges related to Fox. Overall, Fox restructuring charges were $1.7 billion. And $1.2 billion of that was incurred in fiscal '19. So $500 million was done this year. And in this quarter, where we had about a little under $400 million of restructuring charges, a portion of that was also Fox-related. It comes out to about a little over -- a little less than 30%. So the balance was related to our cuts at -- reductions in force at parks."

I think we have 100% buy-in because we have clarity on accountability, which everyone really likes, and we separate out roles to what people tend to do best. Content does what they do best and the same with distribution. So distribution, who manages the P&L, will set the parameters for our annual and long-term budget framework that's been agreed to on the slate with the content creators. And then the content creators then green light the individual projects and then shepherd development and production. So essentially, distribution is now able to optimize the commercialization without maybe too much unnecessary regard for legacy distribution platforms. But at the same time, our creatives, who, as you know, are the best in the world, are really free to do what they do and that's just make the best content and storytelling possible. A lot of collaboration between the 2 groups but ultimately some level of independence in terms of each being what they can be and doing their jobs best."

In terms of sports ratings, sports ratings, we feel that in context of everything that's happening, are actually holding up quite well. But we would be careful not to draw any conclusions about the ultimate health of sports, sort of the long-term impact that you suggested during this pandemic. We really think that we're sort of looking at apples and oranges here. 
I think the best comp we probably have is the NFL, which has been relatively flat. Our Monday night football viewership has been down 4%, relatively modest despite all the headwinds. I mean we've got the risk of seasons not finishing. To your point, we don't have fans in the stands. We have the risk of games individually every week being canceled. We have election news as competition. And we really can't have our fans doing what they like to do the best, which is watch in a communal setting. They pretty much are watching by themselves. Despite all those headwinds, the fact that our Monday night football business is relatively flat in terms of viewership is really -- I think really encouraging. And if you adjust, if you will, viewership over the last couple of months for the amount of available content, you see that they kind of slide together. So we actually don't have any concerns about the long-term health of sports. Obviously, we've got some headwinds as it pertains to short-term challenges and hurdles, but we think that all in all, in context, the health of sports is pretty decent given everything that's going on. 
In terms of India, obviously, we have an executive there, Uday Shankar, who we love, and we wish him well. He gave us some indication several months ago that he was thinking of moving on. We've got a really deep bench there. And we feel that we have all kinds of opportunities and a lot of success so far with Disney+. And we have no reason to believe that, that success won't continue and even accelerate going forward."

But the main question is, having re-upped some Disney+ distribution deals, what changes are you seeing now? Now that you are out of the uncertain launch phase and the value on both sides is better defined for you and for the distributor, does the economics of those deals change? Or should we think about the cost of that marketing channel as locked in?

And they really entail some really high hurdles in terms of not only testing by -- the potential guests that we host on the ships but also a process that has to happen in order to certify our first sailings. Those will necessarily result in delays beyond what we had hoped in terms of getting our ships back in service and making magic for our guests. I guess the best news out of all of it is that we now do see some light at the end of the tunnel. I think we have an opportunity to create sort of a Disney bubble, if you want -- if you would, on each one of our cruise ships. And demand is very, very strong for our cruise ships. We're seeing extremely strong demand in the back half of fiscal year '21 and all of '22 in terms of bookings. That said, that then creates the demand for the new ships that you asked about. And right now, we're anticipating delivering our first new ship, the Wish, in summer of '22. And then we have our next 2 ships in '24 and '25. And so after a slight delay of roughly 6 months on those ships, we think that we're going to be able to bring them on to service. We hope and expect that the world will back to normal by then and anticipate having a fine time trying to fill up the demand of those ships. And we think there's going to be so much pent-up demand that we don't expect to have much issues, given the love that our guests have for Disney Cruise Line. 
In terms of the distribution deals and sort of changing the landscape over time with those, we're really pleased with our partnerships to date. We try to limit them. We don't do too many, but we use them to strategically pursue growth of our subscriber base and lower subscriber acquisition costs. So as you know, we have 1 or 2 of these in each market. That's about it, but it really does help us sort of provide a base during our growth phase. And we've got full flexibility over time to either ramp those up or ramp those down as we see fit."
