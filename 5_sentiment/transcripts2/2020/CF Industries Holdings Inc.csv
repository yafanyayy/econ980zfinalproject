Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over $900 million in free cash for the year. As shown on Slide 6 and 7 of our materials, we are the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team. We have planned extremely well all year, and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we produced more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all this safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year-end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement, and I want to thank everyone at CF who make safety their top priority every day.
In 2019, we delivered a 1-year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for total shareholder returns, and we were the single best-performing company overall, but 1 of these time periods. We believe this consistent long-term outperformance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. Our structural advantages are clear. We provide a nutrient that is nondiscretionary and for which, demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas, and we operated import-dependent regions. We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America, and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in North America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best positioned company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. Looking forward to 2020, we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 million and 20 million product tons each year, and we expect to do this with 1 of the lowest controllable cost structures per product ton in our industry.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about current market conditions and our outlook. Then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressured global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot, highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the start-up of new capacity. This demand, along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates, brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020 with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019, supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.
Just like the rest of the world, North America saw a lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values at New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Large prices appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase, prices today are still lower year-over-year. Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs.
We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming drilling application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year, we saw record prevent plant acres in the U.S. and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income has improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planted corn acres as a whole over 2019 as farmers see typical planting conditions.
We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. Crop futures continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We are well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion. Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices. Looking ahead to 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should be -- this should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices.
Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $915 million. In 2019, we continued to deploy capital in line with our long-standing priorities. We redeemed $750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends, and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Given our significantly reduced fixed charges and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through the cycle.
Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business. Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares, as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry.
Returning to investment-grade also remains a priority. We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced our fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment-grade. We will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."
22357184,653146244,1909045,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2020",2020-02-13,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris.

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company. As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods, and we expect this trend to continue through the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs, but our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs, as you can see on Slide 13.
So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results, but our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA. And as a reminder, in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that, we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment-grade while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.
Longer term, our company remains among the best position in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only nondiscretionary nutrient, nitrogen. We have access to low-cost North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.
With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

We believe that it is a very good product due to its flexibility and adaptability and blendability, and we're seeing that growth taking place in South America, as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market or the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019 last year. We exported -- we continue to export into Europe. And this year, I don't think we will, and that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result, and we think that there will be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was, but what that has caused is a disruption in the flows. And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. We've been focused on that end of the situation developing different markets since we brought up the production in 2000 -- or before we brought up the production in 2017. So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those, and not much of that existed outside of Argentina 5 years ago. And we project that, that will be a million-ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out. When you look at UAN as a balanced product to CF portfolio, well, we start with ammonia, then we make different subproducts, and so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in constructing the new facilities was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or subproducts like DEF and nitric acid, and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN in the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the East and West Coast, developing some new terminals in interior as well as what I just explained in South America. So we're -- we feel like we're well prepared. You're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities, and we believe that UAN is a very good product. And on a price differential, where it's under urea today, we believe that, over time, we'll rebalance and be equal to or greater than urea."

Channel inventories, we think are adequate, especially for the first round as product starts moving to the ground. But when you look at what we've -- what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block, not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community, ammonia has always been a baseload for the eye states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states, and that has generally been about a 4 million-ton product per year, moves through our terminals and the other providers terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that end needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia, around that 4 million-ton range; urea, around 11 million to 12 million; UAN, exceeding 15 million tons. And so for a global market, North America is 3/4 of the U.N. demand today, right around that number. And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much UAN into the market, and that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so what do we need to balance, well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2 million-ton requirement of UAN imports, and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing. Urea, we're importing 4 million to 5 million tons. And if you look at what it brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet, and we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on, and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just-in-time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior."

And as long as you've got a creditworthy off-taker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your products wants to do it. I think if you are the back-end of the ammonia process, it's less clear as to this project actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors, who are the off-takers from air products, suggest that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today, Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well. But it's a bet on the come, and based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that, that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today, and it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of people stepping up in line to double down on that."

And that was delayed in the south, but then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really, throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa is okay. What we expect is that for a precise number. I would say, several 100,000 tons need to move into spring, and probably that will be made up with upgraded products. We're expecting a normal spring for ammonia, which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher, and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices, farmers will apply in 2019, and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well."

And when that is advantageous to the company, we've chosen to export. So a combination of all those factors have put us in a good spot."

If the ability to operate the demands today that are being made to please show up to work from the Chinese government for your national duty is troubling when you're risking potential injury to you or your family members. So our take on the virus today, its impact is on logistics and production. Will the mines open their short coal today? And inventory levels from our reports are at low levels, and so the ability to move and to keep that moving, and then that extends into feed and just-in-time deliveries of feed for protein growth, and so the potential is you will unravel this thing, where does urea shipments to exports rank in the pantheon of needs is probably not very high. And so I think it's going to be not much urea comes out of the Hubei province, it's more phosphate. So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway, and this will just further exacerbate that situation, and that's why we're more comfortable and confident with the tightening of the market. China was the marginal producer, and more tons did come out than we had expected in 2019. We don't see that repeating in 2020."

Or do you play it the daily or a combination thereof? And that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There is a time period during the year where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team, and that's winter. November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March, we have cold weather and high demand, and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes, basis blows out like we've seen in these polar vortex years, where it could be $50 to $100 over the spot price. And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent but a combination of realizing that there is excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand in power generation or LNG exports materialize.

The other issue, though, is in terms of the forward curve, you can't lock 2 years out or 3 years out at today's values because the curve starts increasing.

And a potential outcome clearly would be increased because the question was if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need and then move that into the market as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now, that would be a yield impact of corn wheat and vegetables and fruits, therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. Regarding your question on -- yes, increased end production happened as well as increased output and exports in that export curve, but as a combination or a reflection of higher prices, as we enter 2019, NOLA price was $275. As we enter 2020, it was $220 for urea. The Chinese tons that came out and went to India, at 1 tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB. The next tender was $260, a metric ton FOB. So energy prices were lower, and product prices were higher. And guess what happened over time, product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough, we believe, for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore, a correction takes place and a slowdown, which we're seeing in production. China has run based on, let's say, 78 million tons of static capacity, has run between 55% and 70%, and that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that and some other questions, I think, with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down, and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in this low-valued LNG, will correct the market. And so I just think that's where we're going to be and where our expectation is to trade at higher values as we progress year-on-year."

And we do participate in the export market, and we've built some great relationships, but we utilize that as an arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low demand period in some of those places are in higher demand periods. So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years, before our capacity expansion, there are areas due to logistical difficulties, we had -- we weren't able to reach. And so we added capacity, we have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets and then started targeting places where we should participate, and we're adding some tanks in California, converting some tanks and other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks and other areas where we think we should be participating, and Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati today. We're -- it's several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that, utilizing our domestically-produced tons where we're logistically-favored and then the remainder is what we'll export. So we feel pretty good about that. We work with our customers. We have an extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to 1 million tons per year. And you're right, that conversation is, we want our customers to make money. They need to make money, and that's for the business that they're in, is serving the farmer. We serve, the wholesaler, the retailer, the co-ops that serve those farmers. And so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports, that is our competitor, and the physician and then our marginal ton and some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that."

I mean, I think in I'll give you sort of my quick take and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this 1 is the companies that are -- or the region that is probably the most at-risk from an economic standpoint, I think, is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off, and the renegotiation with NGC has happened at higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually closed as a result of not being competitive anymore. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants. Relative to Russian production and in the U.S., we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still well superior to that of ammonia. And on a dollar per nutrient ton, it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. The -- I think anyone though that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types like we do into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN, that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well. So our view is over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer, you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer-term because it is a more capital-intensive process to make UAN that it is urea, you've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital, otherwise, people stop investing in it. And so we would expect margins to kind of -- once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to, as Bert said earlier, kind of a neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17 where the new capacity came on and it took 1 year to for triples to rebalance and for us to really kind of get the legs under us, and the same things going on right now globally with UAN in the European anti-dumping situation.

And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the 3 producers, and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively -- given a weak fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks. So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than 1 turn in the spring, it's going to push over toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to from the ammonia system. That said, given the weak fall, we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go, so I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for.

And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use. And net-net, the world is a much lower carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's #1, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of negative. The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on, you've got Chinese coal-based plants that shut down and that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is 1 of those questions you have to ask, writ large instead of very locally. Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the 4-hour plus program, which is teaching farmers, best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitric oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon intensity perspective. And then finally, we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce it what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary. Yes, ESG standpoint, and we're reporting on a comprehensive GRI basis from a transparency and disclosure perspective, we'll have a very few number of companies that actually reports on the GRI Index on a comprehensive basis instead of just on a spot or a line item basis. So we feel very good about our ESG profile."

And so even with the increased production in 2019 -- or run rates, they have been fairly stable in their production, really, over the last 5 to 8 years.

And so our business model is all around asset utilization. Our uptime and production efficiency and onstream factor is among the highest in the world and certainly, the highest in the U.S. And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the asset utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first. And on a full year basis, last year, we still generated 21% gross margin in our ammonia segment, which is pretty remarkable that in a lot of businesses to talk about, that being a depressing situation for an industrial business to achieve 21% gross margin for the full year is a pretty outstanding result."

Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over $900 million in free cash for the year. 
As shown on Slides 6 and 7 of our materials, we are the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team. We operated our plants extremely well all year and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we produced more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all these safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year-end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement, and I want to thank everyone at CF who makes safety their top priority every day.
In 2019, we delivered a 1-year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for total shareholder returns, and we were the single best-performing company overall but one of these time periods. We believe this consistent long-term outperformance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. 
Our structural advantages are clear. We provide a nutrient that is nondiscretionary and for which demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. 
We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America, and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. 
Looking forward to 2020, we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 million and 20 million product tons each year, and we expect to do this with one of the lowest controllable cost structures per product ton in our industry.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about current market conditions and our outlook, then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressured global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot, highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. 
India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the start-up of new capacity. This demand, along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates, brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020, with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019, supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia-urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.
Just like the rest of the world, North America saw a lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values at New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Barge prices appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase, prices today are still lower year-over-year. Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs.
We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming spring application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year, we saw record prevent plant acres in the U.S. and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income has improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planted corn acres as a whole over 2019 as farmers see typical planting conditions. We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. 
Crop futures continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen-consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We are well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. 
While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion. Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices. 
Looking ahead to 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should be -- this should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $915 million. 
In 2019, we continued to deploy capital in line with our long-standing priorities. We redeemed $750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends, and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Given our significantly reduced fixed charges and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through this cycle.
Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business. Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares, as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry. 
Returning to investment-grade also remains a priority. We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced our fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment-grade. We will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company. 
As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods, and we expect this trend to continue through the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs, but our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs, as you can see on Slide 13.
So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results, but our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA. And as a reminder, in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that, we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment-grade while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.
Longer term, our company remains among the best positioned in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only nondiscretionary nutrient, nitrogen. We have access to low-cost North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.

We believe that it is a very good product due to its flexibility and adaptability and blendability, and we're seeing that growth taking place in South America, as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market are the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019. 
Last year, we exported -- we continued to export into Europe. And this year, I don't think we will, and that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result, and we think that there'll be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was. But what that has caused is a disruption in the flows. And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. 
We've been focused on that end of the situation, developing different markets since we brought up the production in 2000 -- or before we brought up the production in 2017. So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those. And not much of that existed outside of Argentina 5 years ago. And we project that, that will be a 1-million ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out. 
When you look at UAN as a balanced product to CF's portfolio -- well, we start with ammonia then we make different subproducts. And so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in construction -- constructing the new facilities was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or subproducts like DEF and nitric acid, and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN into the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the East and West Coasts, developing some new terminals in interior as well as what I just explained in South America. 
So we're -- we feel like we're well prepared. You're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities, and we believe that UAN is a very good product. And on a price differential, where it's under urea today, we believe that, over time, we'll rebalance and be equal to or greater than urea."

So it's a combination of what you just explained. Channel inventories, we think, are adequate, especially for the first round as products starts moving to the ground. 
But when you look at what we've -- what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block, not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community, ammonia has always been a baseload for the I states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states. And that has generally been about a 4-million ton product per year, moves through our terminals and the other providers' terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that N needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia, around that 4-million ton range; urea, around 11 million to 12 million tons; UAN, exceeding 15 million tons. And so for a global market, North America is 3/4 of UAN demand today, right around that number. 
And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much UAN into the market, and that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so what do we need to balance? Well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2-million ton requirement of UAN imports, and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing. 
Urea, we're importing 4 million to 5 million tons. And if you look at what's been brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet, and we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on, and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just-in-time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior."

My perspective is that if you're air products, this is a great project because they get to get better utilization of their existing hydrogen production along the pipeline to get to expand their pipeline and build a new SCR. And as long as you've got a credit-worthy offtaker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your products wants to do it. 
I think if you are the back-end of the ammonia process, it's less clear as to this project to actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors, who are the offtakers from air products, suggest that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today, Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. 
So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well, but it's a bet on the come. And based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that. But that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today, and it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of people stepping up in line to double down on that."

And that was delayed in the south, but then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really, throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa is okay. 
What we expect is that for a precise number. I would say, several hundred thousand tons need to move into spring, and probably that will be made up with upgraded products. We're expecting a normal spring for ammonia, which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher, and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices farmers will apply in 2019, and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well."

That really helps with focus on -- if urea or UAN, those product leaders are more focused on what's better for CF. We have that conversation every day. 
The other issue is the river. And there have been logistical issues, which we identified early or have been able to capitalize on later because of our distribution system and unique logistical assets. And so it helps to put the company in that position as we prepared it in the past. And then -- so what we're seeing is we have differentiated production in Canada and Northern Iowa as well as the Donaldsonville, so that we have arbitraged exports against imports. And when that is advantageous to the company, we've chosen to export. So a combination of all those factors have put us in a good spot."

It's the ability to operate the demands today that are being made to please show up to work from the Chinese government for your national duty is troubling when you're risking potential injury to you or your family members. 
So our take on the virus today -- its impact is on logistics and production. Will the mines open their short coal today? And inventory levels from our reports are at low levels. And so the ability to move and to keep that moving -- and then that extends into feed and just-in-time deliveries of feed for protein growth. And so the potential as you unravel this thing, where does urea shipments-to-exports rank in the pantheon of needs is probably not very high. 
And so I think it's going to be not much urea comes out of the Hubei province, it's more phosphate. So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway, and this will just further exacerbate that situation. And that's why we're more comfortable and confident with the tightening of the market. China was the marginal producer and more tons did come out than we had expected in 2019.

But you're right. The question is, do you lock in? Or do you play it -- the daily or a combination thereof? And that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There's a time period during the year where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team, and that's winter. November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March, we have cold weather and high demand, and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes basis blows out, like we've seen in these polar vortex years, where it could be $50 to $100 over the spot price. 
And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent, but a combination of realizing that there -- excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand in power generation or LNG exports materialize.

And a potential outcome clearly would be increased -- because the question was if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need and then move that into the market as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now, that would be a yield impact of corn wheat and vegetables and fruits, therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value -- carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. 
Regarding your question on -- yes, increased N production happened as well as increased output and exports in that export curve, but as a combination or a reflection of higher prices. As we enter 2019, the NOLA price was $275. As we enter 2020, it was $220 for urea. The Chinese tons that came out and went to India at 1 tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB. The next tender was $260 a metric ton FOB. 
So energy prices were lower and product prices were higher. And guess what happened? Over time, product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough, we believe, for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore, a correction takes place and a slowdown, which we're seeing in production. China has run based on, let's say, 78 million tons of static capacity, has run between 55% and 70%. 
And that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that, and some other questions, I think, with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down, and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in this low-value LNG, will correct the market.

A large 90-plus percent of our volume is directed, focused and attended to this market. And we do participate in the export market, and we've built some great relationships. But we utilize that as arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low-demand period in some of those places or in higher-demand periods. 
So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years, before our capacity expansion, there are areas due to logistical difficulties, we had -- we weren't able to reach. And so we added capacity. We have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets, and then started targeting places where we should participate. And we're adding some tanks in California, converting some tanks in other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks in other areas where we think we should be participating. 
And Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati. Today, we're -- it's several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that, utilizing our domestically produced tons where we're logistically favored, and then the remainder is what we'll export. So we feel pretty good about that. 
We work with our customers. We have extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to 1 million tons per year. And you're right, that conversation is we want our customers to make money. They need to make money, and that's because the business that they're in is serving the farmer. We serve the wholesaler, the retailer, the co-ops that serve those farmers. 
And so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports. That is our competitor. And the position -- and then our marginal ton in some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with, Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that."

I mean, I think -- Adam, I'll give you sort of my quick take, and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this one is the companies that are -- or the region that is probably the most at risk from an economic standpoint, I think, is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas-indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off and the renegotiation with NGC has happened at higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually close as a result of not being competitive anymore. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants. 
Relative to Russian production and in the U.S., we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still, well, superior to that of ammonia. And on a dollar per nutrient ton, it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. The -- I think anyone, though, that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types, like we do, into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN, that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well. 
So our view is the -- over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer, you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer-term because it is a more capital-intensive process to make UAN than it is urea. You've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital, otherwise, people stop investing in it. 
And so we would expect margins to kind of -- once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to, as Bert said earlier, kind of net neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17, where the new capacity came on and it took 1 year or 2 to -- for trade flows to rebalance and for us to really kind of get our sea legs under us. And the same thing is going on right now globally with UAN in the European anti-dumping situation. Bert?"

Coke, Nutrien and CF are the ones that have the cryogenic storage tanks or terminals in-market. And while there's some storage at plant locations, generally speaking, it's not more than 50,000 or 100,000 tons. 
And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the 3 producers, and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively -- given a weak fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks. So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than 1 turn in the spring, it's going to push farmers toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to -- from the ammonia system. 
That said, given the weak fall, we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go. So I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for. And if you have a situation like we had last spring, you're not going to see anywhere close to 4 million tons go down."

I mean, I think from an ESG perspective, there's 4 or 5 plants here that we're focused on. The first is that nitrogen is actually a product that is very beneficial to, from a global perspective, carbon emissions. And the reason for that is, even though agriculture, sort of, it depends upon which agency you look at, is estimated somewhere between 25% and 30% of -- responsible for 25% to 30% of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, the vast majority of that comes from land use. And so as you are cutting down carbon sequestering for us in order to cultivate those acres, you're releasing a lot of carbon and you furthermore don't have the mechanism to further sequester carbon going forward. 
And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that, in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use. And net-net, the world is a much lower-carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's #1, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of negative. 
The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon-intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on, you've got Chinese coal-based plants that shut down and that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is one of those questions you have to ask writ large instead of very locally. 
Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the 4-hour plus program, which is teaching farmers best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitrous oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon-intensity perspective. 
And then finally, we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary, yes, ESG standpoint. And we're reporting on a comprehensive GRI basis from a transparency and disclosure perspective. We're one of a very few number of companies that actually reports on the GRI index on a comprehensive basis instead of just on a spot or line item basis. So we feel very good about our ESG profile."

That said, the real marginal production costs globally is still Chinese anthracite coal. And Brent price does not really affect the Chinese anthracite coal price directly. And in fact, as Bert indicated, whether it's coronavirus or other things going on, you've seen actual coal price strengthen a little bit.

So when I look at -- we look at, going forward, we expect another tender, probably in late March, early April and kind of running on the same pattern, whether being equal of continued import and being the largest importing country in the world. 
There are 2 plants that are set to come onstream at the -- kind of this year, early next year. And generally, those plants have been late. And then there have been issues with feedstock supplies, and so not sure when that overall production will come on. But there are some old -- especially the naphtha-based plants, are suspect. And so even with the increased production in 2019 -- or run rates, they have been fairly stable in their production, really, over the last 5 to 8 years.

And so our business model is all around asset utilization. Our uptime and production efficiency and onstream factor is among the highest in the world and, certainly, the highest in the U.S. And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the asset utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. 
And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we're -- we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over $900 million in free cash for the year. 
As shown on Slides 6 and 7 of our materials, we are the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team. We operated our plants extremely well all year and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we produced more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all these safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year-end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement, and I want to thank everyone at CF who makes safety their top priority every day.
In 2019, we delivered a 1-year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for total shareholder returns, and we were the single best-performing company overall but one of these time periods. We believe this consistent long-term outperformance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. 
Our structural advantages are clear. We provide a nutrient that is nondiscretionary and for which demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. 
We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America, and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in North America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. 
Looking forward to 2020, we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 million and 20 million product tons each year, and we expect to do this with one of the lowest controllable cost structures per product ton in our industry.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about current market conditions and our outlook, then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability.

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressured global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot, highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. 
India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the start-up of new capacity. This demand, along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates, brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020, with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019, supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia-urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.
Just like the rest of the world, North America saw a lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values at New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Barge prices have appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase, prices today are still lower year-over-year. Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs.
We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming spring application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year, we saw record prevent plant acres in the U.S. and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income has improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planted corn acres as a whole over 2019 as farmers see typical planting conditions.  We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. 
Crop futures continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen-consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We are well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. 
While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion. Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices. 
Looking ahead to 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should be -- this should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices.  Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $915 million. 
In 2019, we continued to deploy capital in line with our long-standing priorities. We redeemed $750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends, and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Given our significantly reduced fixed charges and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through this cycle.
Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business. Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares, as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry.  
Returning to investment grade also remains a priority. We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced our fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment-grade. We will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."
22357184,653146244,1911393,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 13, 2020",2020-02-13,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris.

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company. 
As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods, and we expect this trend to continue through the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs, but our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs, as you can see on Slide 13.
So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results, but our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA. And as a reminder, in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that, we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment grade while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.
Longer term, our company remains among the best positioned in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only nondiscretionary nutrient, nitrogen. We have access to low-cost North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.

We believe that it is a very good product due to its flexibility and adaptability and blendability, and we're seeing that growth taking place in South America, as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market are the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019. 
Last year, we exported -- we continued to export into Europe. And this year, I don't think we will, and that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result, and we think that there'll be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was. But what that has caused is a disruption in the flows. And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. 
We've been focused on that end of the situation, developing different markets since we brought up the production in 2000 -- or before we brought up the production in 2017.  So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those. And not much of that existed outside of Argentina 5 years ago. And we project that, that will be a 1-million ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out. 
When you look at UAN as a balanced product to CF's portfolio -- well, we start with ammonia then we make different subproducts. And so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in construction -- constructing the new facilities was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or subproducts like DEF and nitric acid, and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN into the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the East and West Coasts, developing some new terminals in interior as well as what I just explained in South America. 
So we're -- we feel like we're well prepared. You're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities, and we believe that UAN is a very good product. And on a price differential, where it's under urea today, we believe that, over time, we'll rebalance and be equal to or greater than urea."

So it's a combination of what you just explained. Channel inventories, we think, are adequate, especially for the first round as products starts moving to the ground. 
But when you look at what we've -- what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block, not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community, ammonia has always been a baseload for the I states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states. And that has generally been about a 4-million ton product per year, moves through our terminals and the other providers' terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that N needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia, around that 4-million ton range; urea, around 11 million to 12 million tons; UAN, exceeding 15 million tons. And so for a global market, North America is 3/4 of UAN demand today, right around that number. 
And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much UAN into the market, and that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so what do we need to balance? Well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2-million ton requirement of UAN imports, and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing. 
Urea, we're importing 4 million to 5 million tons. And if you look at what's been brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet, and we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on, and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just-in-time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior."

My perspective is that if you're air products, this is a great project because they get to get better utilization of their existing hydrogen production along the pipeline to get to expand their pipeline and build a new SCR. And as long as you've got a credit-worthy offtaker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your products wants to do it. 
I think if you are the back-end of the ammonia process, it's less clear as to this project to actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors, who are the offtakers from air products, suggest that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today, Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. 
So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well, but it's a bet on the come. And based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that. But that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today, and it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of people stepping up in line to double down on that."

And that was delayed in the south, but then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really, throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa is okay. 
What we expect is that for a precise number. I would say, several hundred thousand tons need to move into spring, and probably that will be made up with upgraded products. We're expecting a normal spring for ammonia, which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher, and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices farmers will apply in 2019, and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well."

So our take on the virus today -- its impact is on logistics and production. Will the mines open their short coal today? And inventory levels from our reports are at low levels. And so the ability to move and to keep that moving -- and then that extends into feed and just-in-time deliveries of feed for protein growth. And so the potential as you unravel this thing, where does urea shipments-to-exports rank in the pantheon of needs is probably not very high. 
And so I think it's going to be not much urea comes out of the Hubei province, it's more phosphate.  So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway, and this will just further exacerbate that situation. And that's why we're more comfortable and confident with the tightening of the market. China was the marginal producer and more tons did come out than we had expected in 2019. We don't see that repeating in 2020."

But you're right.  The question is, do you lock in? Or do you play it -- the daily or a combination thereof? And that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There's a time period during the year where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team, and that's winter. November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March, we have cold weather and high demand, and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes basis blows out, like we've seen in these polar vortex years, where it could be $50 to $100 over the spot price. 
And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent, but a combination of realizing that there -- excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand in power generation or LNG exports materialize. Net-net, we're at the positive end of that curve.

The other issue, though, is in terms of the forward curve, you can't lock 2 years out or 3 years out at today's values because the curve starts increasing. And so that's why, as Bert said, there's a bit of a mixed bag in terms of how you approach it. But structurally, we're very optimistic about low gas costs through the balance of the year."

And a potential outcome clearly would be increased -- because the question was if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need and then move that into the market as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now, that would be a yield impact of corn, wheat and vegetables and fruits, therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value -- carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. 
Regarding your question on -- yes, increased N production happened as well as increased output and exports in that export curve, but as a combination or a reflection of higher prices. As we enter 2019, the NOLA price was $275. As we enter 2020, it was $220 for urea. The Chinese tons that came out and went to India at 1 tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB. The next tender was $260 a metric ton FOB. 
So energy prices were lower and product prices were higher. And guess what happened? Over time, product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough, we believe, for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore, a correction takes place and a slowdown, which we're seeing in production. China has run based on, let's say, 78 million tons of static capacity, has run between 55% and 70%. 
And that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that, and some other questions, I think, with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down, and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in this low-value LNG, will correct the market. And so I just think that's where we're going to be and where our expectations to trade at higher values as we progress year-on-year."

But we utilize that as arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low-demand period in some of those places or in higher-demand periods. 
So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years, before our capacity expansion, there are areas due to logistical difficulties, we had -- we weren't able to reach. And so we added capacity. We have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets, and then started targeting places where we should participate. And we're adding some tanks in California, converting some tanks in other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks in other areas where we think we should be participating. 
And Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati. Today, we're -- it's several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that, utilizing our domestically produced tons where we're logistically favored, and then the remainder is what we'll export. So we feel pretty good about that. 
We work with our customers. We have extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to 1 million tons per year. And you're right, that conversation is we want our customers to make money. They need to make money, and that's because the business that they're in is serving the farmer. We serve the wholesaler, the retailer, the co-ops that serve those farmers. 
And so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports. That is our competitor. And the position -- and then our marginal ton in some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with, Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that."

I mean, I think -- Adam, I'll give you sort of my quick take, and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this one is the companies that are -- or the region that is probably the most at risk from an economic standpoint, I think, is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas-indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off and the renegotiation with NGC has happened at higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually close as a result of not being competitive anymore. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants. 
Relative to Russian production and in the U.S., we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still, well, superior to that of ammonia. And on a dollar per nutrient ton, it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. The -- I think anyone, though, that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types, like we do, into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN, that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well. 
So our view is the -- over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer, you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer-term because it is a more capital-intensive process to make UAN than it is urea. You've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital, otherwise, people stop investing in it. 
And so we would expect margins to kind of -- once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to, as Bert said earlier, kind of net neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17, where the new capacity came on and it took 1 year or 2 to -- for trade flows to rebalance and for us to really kind of get our sea legs under us. And the same thing is going on right now globally with UAN in the European anti-dumping situation. Bert?"

And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the 3 producers, and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively -- given a weak fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks. So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than 1 turn in the spring, it's going to push farmers toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to -- from the ammonia system. 
That said, given the weak fall, we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go. So I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for.

I mean, I think from an ESG perspective, there's 4 or 5 plants here that we're focused on. The first is that nitrogen is actually a product that is very beneficial to, from a global perspective, carbon emissions. And the reason for that is, even though agriculture, sort of, it depends upon which agency you look at, is estimated somewhere between 25% and 30% of -- responsible for 25% to 30% of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, the vast majority of that comes from land use. And so as you are cutting down carbon sequestering for us in order to cultivate those acres, you're releasing a lot of carbon and you furthermore don't have the mechanism to further sequester carbon going forward. 
And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that, in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use. And net-net, the world is a much lower-carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's #1, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of negative. 
The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon-intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on, you've got Chinese coal-based plants that shut down and that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is one of those questions you have to ask writ large instead of very locally. 
Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the 4-hour plus program, which is teaching farmers best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitrous oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon-intensity perspective. 
And then finally, we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary, yes, ESG standpoint.

That said, the real marginal production costs globally is still Chinese anthracite coal. And Brent price does not really affect the Chinese anthracite coal price directly. And in fact, as Bert indicated, whether it's coronavirus or other things going on, you've seen actual coal price strengthen a little bit. So the high end of the cost curve has gone up or stayed flat relative to what looks like a bit of a windfall for some other people in more third or early fourth quartile.

And some exciting things are taking place in India with the Modi government regarding investments, infrastructure and in terms of an educated population, a growing population. So when I look at -- we look at, going forward, we expect another tender, probably in late March, early April and kind of running on the same pattern, whether being equal of continued import and being the largest importing country in the world. 
There are 2 plants that are set to come onstream at the -- kind of this year, early next year. And generally, those plants have been late. And then there have been issues with feedstock supplies, and so not sure when that overall production will come on. But there are some old -- especially the naphtha-based plants, are suspect. And so even with the increased production in 2019 -- or run rates, they have been fairly stable in their production, really, over the last 5 to 8 years. 
And so we see good things. And we've mentioned both India and Brazil in our prepared remarks on -- in terms of growth, growth of demand and not necessarily too much of an increase in supply."

And there is enough production out there on a global basis that, if we were to curtail, I wouldn't expect that to move the market a bit because there's sufficient supply elsewhere in the world. 
And so our business model is all around asset utilization. Our uptime and production efficiency and onstream factor is among the highest in the world and, certainly, the highest in the U.S. And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the asset utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. 
And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we're -- we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first. And on a full year basis, last year, we still generated 21% gross margin in our ammonia segment, which is pretty remarkable that -- in a lot of businesses that talk about that being a depressing situation, for an industrial business to achieve 21% gross margin for the full year is pretty outstanding result."

Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over $900 million in free cash for the year. 
As shown on Slides 6 and 7 of our materials, we are the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team. We operated our plants extremely well all year and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we produced more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all these safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year-end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement, and I want to thank everyone at CF who makes safety their top priority every day.
In 2019, we delivered a 1-year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for total shareholder returns, and we were the single best-performing company overall but one of these time periods. We believe this consistent long-term outperformance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. 
Our structural advantages are clear. We provide a nutrient that is nondiscretionary and for which demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. 
We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America, and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in North America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. 
Looking forward to 2020, we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 million and 20 million product tons each year, and we expect to do this with one of the lowest controllable cost structures per product ton in our industry.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about current market conditions and our outlook, then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability.

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressured global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot, highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. 
India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the start-up of new capacity. This demand, along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates, brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020, with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019, supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia-urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.
Just like the rest of the world, North America saw a lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values at New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Barge prices have appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase, prices today are still lower year-over-year. Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs.
We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming spring application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year, we saw record prevent plant acres in the U.S. and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income has improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planted corn acres as a whole over 2019 as farmers see typical planting conditions.  We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. 
Crop futures continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen-consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We are well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. 
While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion. Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices. 
Looking ahead to 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should be -- this should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices.  Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $915 million. 
In 2019, we continued to deploy capital in line with our long-standing priorities. We redeemed $750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends, and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Given our significantly reduced fixed charges and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through this cycle.
Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business. Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares, as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry.  
Returning to investment grade also remains a priority. We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced our fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment-grade. We will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company. 
As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods, and we expect this trend to continue through the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs, but our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs, as you can see on Slide 13.
So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results, but our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA. And as a reminder, in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that, we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment grade while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.
Longer term, our company remains among the best positioned in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only nondiscretionary nutrient, nitrogen. We have access to low-cost North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.

We believe that it is a very good product due to its flexibility and adaptability and blendability, and we're seeing that growth taking place in South America, as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market are the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019. 
Last year, we exported -- we continued to export into Europe. And this year, I don't think we will, and that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result, and we think that there'll be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was. But what that has caused is a disruption in the flows. And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. 
We've been focused on that end of the situation, developing different markets since we brought up the production in 2000 -- or before we brought up the production in 2017.  So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those. And not much of that existed outside of Argentina 5 years ago. And we project that, that will be a 1-million ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out. 
When you look at UAN as a balanced product to CF's portfolio -- well, we start with ammonia then we make different subproducts. And so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in construction -- constructing the new facilities was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or subproducts like DEF and nitric acid, and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN into the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the East and West Coasts, developing some new terminals in interior as well as what I just explained in South America. 
So we're -- we feel like we're well prepared. You're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities, and we believe that UAN is a very good product.

So it's a combination of what you just explained. Channel inventories, we think, are adequate, especially for the first round as products starts moving to the ground. 
But when you look at what we've -- what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block, not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community, ammonia has always been a baseload for the I states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states. And that has generally been about a 4-million ton product per year, moves through our terminals and the other providers' terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that N needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia, around that 4-million ton range; urea, around 11 million to 12 million tons; UAN, exceeding 15 million tons. And so for a global market, North America is 3/4 of UAN demand today, right around that number. 
And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much UAN into the market, and that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so what do we need to balance? Well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2-million ton requirement of UAN imports, and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing. 
Urea, we're importing 4 million to 5 million tons. And if you look at what's been brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet, and we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on, and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just-in-time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior."

My perspective is that if you're air products, this is a great project because they get to get better utilization of their existing hydrogen production along the pipeline to get to expand their pipeline and build a new SCR. And as long as you've got a credit-worthy offtaker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your products wants to do it. 
I think if you are the back-end of the ammonia process, it's less clear as to this project to actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors, who are the offtakers from air products, suggest that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today, Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. 
So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well, but it's a bet on the come. And based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that. But that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today, and it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of people stepping up in line to double down on that."

And that was delayed in the south, but then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really, throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa is okay. 
What we expect is that for a precise number. I would say, several hundred thousand tons need to move into spring, and probably that will be made up with upgraded products. We're expecting a normal spring for ammonia, which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher, and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices farmers will apply in 2019, and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well."

That really helps with focus on -- if urea or UAN, those product leaders are more focused on what's better for CF. We have that conversation every day. 
The other issue is the river. And there have been logistical issues, which we identified early or have been able to capitalize on later because of our distribution system and unique logistical assets. And so it helps to put the company in that position as we prepared it in the past. And then -- so what we're seeing is we have differentiated production in Canada and Northern Iowa as well as the Donaldsonville, so that we have arbitraged exports against imports. And when that is advantageous to the company, we've chosen to export. So a combination of all those factors have put us in a good spot."

So our take on the virus today -- its impact is on logistics and production. Will the mines open their short coal today? And inventory levels from our reports are at low levels. And so the ability to move and to keep that moving -- and then that extends into feed and just-in-time deliveries of feed for protein growth. And so the potential as you unravel this thing, where does urea shipments-to-exports rank in the pantheon of needs is probably not very high. 
And so I think it's going to be not much urea comes out of the Hubei province, it's more phosphate.  So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway, and this will just further exacerbate that situation. And that's why we're more comfortable and confident with the tightening of the market. China was the marginal producer and more tons did come out than we had expected in 2019.

But you're right.  The question is, do you lock in? Or do you play it -- the daily or a combination thereof? And that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There's a time period during the year where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team, and that's winter. November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March, we have cold weather and high demand, and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes basis blows out, like we've seen in these polar vortex years, where it could be $50 to $100 over the spot price. 
And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent, but a combination of realizing that there -- excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand in power generation or LNG exports materialize.

And a potential outcome clearly would be increased -- because the question was if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need and then move that into the market as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now, that would be a yield impact of corn, wheat and vegetables and fruits, therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value -- carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. 
Regarding your question on -- yes, increased N production happened as well as increased output and exports in that export curve, but as a combination or a reflection of higher prices. As we enter 2019, the NOLA price was $275. As we enter 2020, it was $220 for urea. The Chinese tons that came out and went to India at 1 tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB. The next tender was $260 a metric ton FOB. 
So energy prices were lower and product prices were higher. And guess what happened? Over time, product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough, we believe, for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore, a correction takes place and a slowdown, which we're seeing in production. China has run based on, let's say, 78 million tons of static capacity, has run between 55% and 70%. 
And that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that, and some other questions, I think, with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down, and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in this low-value LNG, will correct the market. And so I just think that's where we're going to be and where our expectations to trade at higher values as we progress year-on-year."

A large 90-plus percent of our volume is directed, focused and attended to this market. And we do participate in the export market, and we've built some great relationships. But we utilize that as arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low-demand period in some of those places or in higher-demand periods. 
So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years, before our capacity expansion, there are areas due to logistical difficulties, we had -- we weren't able to reach. And so we added capacity. We have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets, and then started targeting places where we should participate. And we're adding some tanks in California, converting some tanks in other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks in other areas where we think we should be participating. 
And Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati. Today, we're -- it's several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that, utilizing our domestically produced tons where we're logistically favored, and then the remainder is what we'll export. So we feel pretty good about that. 
We work with our customers. We have extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to 1 million tons per year. And you're right, that conversation is we want our customers to make money. They need to make money, and that's because the business that they're in is serving the farmer. We serve the wholesaler, the retailer, the co-ops that serve those farmers. 
And so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports. That is our competitor. And the position -- and then our marginal ton in some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with, Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that."

I mean how do we think about capacity rationalization there that might be getting forced at these price levels and/or, just on the other side, the demand response domestically of UAN trading at such a big discount to urea? I'm just trying to think about how this price disparity kind of closes over time."

I mean, I think -- Adam, I'll give you sort of my quick take, and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this one is the companies that are -- or the region that is probably the most at risk from an economic standpoint, I think, is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas-indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off and the renegotiation with NGC has happened at higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually close as a result of not being competitive anymore. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants. 
Relative to Russian production and in the U.S., we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still, well, superior to that of ammonia. And on a dollar per nutrient ton, it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. The -- I think anyone, though, that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types, like we do, into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN, that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well. 
So our view is the -- over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer, you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer-term because it is a more capital-intensive process to make UAN than it is urea. You've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital, otherwise, people stop investing in it. 
And so we would expect margins to kind of -- once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to, as Bert said earlier, kind of net neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17, where the new capacity came on and it took 1 year or 2 to -- for trade flows to rebalance and for us to really kind of get our sea legs under us. And the same thing is going on right now globally with UAN in the European anti-dumping situation. Bert?"

Coke, Nutrien and CF are the ones that have the cryogenic storage tanks or terminals in-market. And while there's some storage at plant locations, generally speaking, it's not more than 50,000 or 100,000 tons. 
And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the 3 producers, and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively -- given a weak fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks. So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than 1 turn in the spring, it's going to push farmers toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to -- from the ammonia system. 
That said, given the weak fall, we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go. So I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for. And if you have a situation like we had last spring, you're not going to see anywhere close to 4 million tons go down."

I mean, I think from an ESG perspective, there's 4 or 5 plants here that we're focused on. The first is that nitrogen is actually a product that is very beneficial to, from a global perspective, carbon emissions. And the reason for that is, even though agriculture, sort of, it depends upon which agency you look at, is estimated somewhere between 25% and 30% of -- responsible for 25% to 30% of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, the vast majority of that comes from land use. And so as you are cutting down carbon sequestering for us in order to cultivate those acres, you're releasing a lot of carbon and you furthermore don't have the mechanism to further sequester carbon going forward. 
And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that, in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use. And net-net, the world is a much lower-carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's #1, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of negative. 
The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon-intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on, you've got Chinese coal-based plants that shut down and that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is one of those questions you have to ask writ large instead of very locally. 
Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the 4-hour plus program, which is teaching farmers best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitrous oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon-intensity perspective. 
And then finally, we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary, yes, ESG standpoint. And we're reporting on a comprehensive GRI basis from a transparency and disclosure perspective. We're one of a very few number of companies that actually reports on the GRI index on a comprehensive basis instead of just on a spot or line item basis. So we feel very good about our ESG profile."

And in fact, as Bert indicated, whether it's coronavirus or other things going on, you've seen actual coal price strengthen a little bit.

So when I look at -- we look at, going forward, we expect another tender, probably in late March, early April and kind of running on the same pattern, whether being equal of continued import and being the largest importing country in the world. 
There are 2 plants that are set to come onstream at the -- kind of this year, early next year. And generally, those plants have been late. And then there have been issues with feedstock supplies, and so not sure when that overall production will come on. But there are some old -- especially the naphtha-based plants, are suspect. And so even with the increased production in 2019 -- or run rates, they have been fairly stable in their production, really, over the last 5 to 8 years.

Our uptime and production efficiency and onstream factor is among the highest in the world and, certainly, the highest in the U.S. And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the asset utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. 
And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we're -- we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over $900 million in free cash for the year. 
As shown on Slides 6 and 7 of our materials, we are the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team. We operated our plants extremely well all year and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, we produced more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all these safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year-end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement, and I want to thank everyone at CF who makes safety their top priority every day.
In 2019, we delivered a 1-year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for total shareholder returns, and we were the single best-performing company overall but one of these time periods. We believe this consistent long-term outperformance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. 
Our structural advantages are clear. We provide a nutrient that is nondiscretionary and for which demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. 
We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America, and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in North America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.
Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best-positioned company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. 
Looking forward to 2020, we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 million and 20 million product tons each year, and we expect to do this with one of the lowest controllable cost structures per product ton in our industry.
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about current market conditions and our outlook, then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?"

Since the start of the second half of 2019, low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressured global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot, highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. 
India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the start-up of new capacity. This demand, along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates, brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020, with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019, supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia-urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.
Just like the rest of the world, North America saw a lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values at New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Barge prices have appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase, prices today are still lower year-over-year. Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs.
We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming spring application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year, we saw record prevent plant acres in the U.S. and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income has improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planted corn acres as a whole over 2019 as farmers see typical planting conditions.  We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. 
Crop futures continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen-consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We are well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. 
While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion. Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices. 
Looking ahead to 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should be -- this should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices.  Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $915 million. 
In 2019, we continued to deploy capital in line with our long-standing priorities. We redeemed $750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends, and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet. Given our significantly reduced fixed charges and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through this cycle.
Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business. Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares, as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry.  
Returning to investment grade also remains a priority. We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced our fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment-grade. We will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company. 
As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods, and we expect this trend to continue through the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs, but our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs, as you can see on Slide 13.
So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results, but our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA. And as a reminder, in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that, we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment grade while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.
Longer term, our company remains among the best positioned in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only nondiscretionary nutrient, nitrogen. We have access to low-cost North American natural gas, and we operate in import-dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.

We believe that it is a very good product due to its flexibility and adaptability and blendability, and we're seeing that growth taking place in South America, as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market are the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019. 
Last year, we exported -- we continued to export into Europe. And this year, I don't think we will, and that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result, and we think that there'll be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was. But what that has caused is a disruption in the flows. And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. 
We've been focused on that end of the situation, developing different markets since we brought up the production in 2000 -- or before we brought up the production in 2017.  So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those. And not much of that existed outside of Argentina 5 years ago. And we project that, that will be a 1-million ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out. 
When you look at UAN as a balanced product to CF's portfolio -- well, we start with ammonia then we make different subproducts. And so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in construction -- constructing the new facilities was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or subproducts like DEF and nitric acid, and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN into the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the East and West Coasts, developing some new terminals in interior as well as what I just explained in South America. 
So we're -- we feel like we're well prepared. You're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities, and we believe that UAN is a very good product. And on a price differential, where it's under urea today, we believe that, over time, we'll rebalance and be equal to or greater than urea."

So it's a combination of what you just explained. Channel inventories, we think, are adequate, especially for the first round as products starts moving to the ground. 
But when you look at what we've -- what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block, not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community, ammonia has always been a baseload for the I states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states. And that has generally been about a 4-million ton product per year, moves through our terminals and the other providers' terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that N needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia, around that 4-million ton range; urea, around 11 million to 12 million tons; UAN, exceeding 15 million tons. And so for a global market, North America is 3/4 of UAN demand today, right around that number. 
And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much UAN into the market, and that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so what do we need to balance? Well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2-million ton requirement of UAN imports, and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing. 
Urea, we're importing 4 million to 5 million tons. And if you look at what's been brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet, and we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on, and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just-in-time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior."

And as long as you've got a credit-worthy offtaker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your products wants to do it. 
I think if you are the back-end of the ammonia process, it's less clear as to this project to actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors, who are the offtakers from air products, suggest that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today, Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. 
So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well, but it's a bet on the come. And based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that. But that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today, and it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of people stepping up in line to double down on that."

And that was delayed in the south, but then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really, throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa is okay. 
What we expect is that for a precise number. I would say, several hundred thousand tons need to move into spring, and probably that will be made up with upgraded products. We're expecting a normal spring for ammonia, which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher, and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices farmers will apply in 2019, and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well."

So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway, and this will just further exacerbate that situation.

So -- and as Bert says, whether it's coalmines or urea plants, those are the places where I think you're going to see a reduction in labor hours. So we would expect it to be kind of -- nothing like this is ever a net positive. But from a humanity perspective, but relative to urea supply, it probably will tighten it up."

So it's a very nice place to be, and we're very thankful for being a North American producer locking in North American gas. 
But you're right.  The question is, do you lock in? Or do you play it -- the daily or a combination thereof? And that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There's a time period during the year where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team, and that's winter. November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March, we have cold weather and high demand, and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes basis blows out, like we've seen in these polar vortex years, where it could be $50 to $100 over the spot price. 
And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent, but a combination of realizing that there -- excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand in power generation or LNG exports materialize. Net-net, we're at the positive end of that curve.

In our view, there's probably a price pressure coming instead of this is the low point. And so we're -- we are very positive in terms of buying daily or month ahead as opposed to taking long-term lock positions. 
The other issue, though, is in terms of the forward curve, you can't lock 2 years out or 3 years out at today's values because the curve starts increasing. And so that's why, as Bert said, there's a bit of a mixed bag in terms of how you approach it. But structurally, we're very optimistic about low gas costs through the balance of the year."

And a potential outcome clearly would be increased -- because the question was if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need and then move that into the market as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now, that would be a yield impact of corn, wheat and vegetables and fruits, therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value -- carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. 
Regarding your question on -- yes, increased N production happened as well as increased output and exports in that export curve, but as a combination or a reflection of higher prices. As we enter 2019, the NOLA price was $275. As we enter 2020, it was $220 for urea. The Chinese tons that came out and went to India at 1 tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB. The next tender was $260 a metric ton FOB. 
So energy prices were lower and product prices were higher. And guess what happened? Over time, product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough, we believe, for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore, a correction takes place and a slowdown, which we're seeing in production. China has run based on, let's say, 78 million tons of static capacity, has run between 55% and 70%. 
And that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that, and some other questions, I think, with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down, and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in this low-value LNG, will correct the market. And so I just think that's where we're going to be and where our expectations to trade at higher values as we progress year-on-year."

But we utilize that as arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low-demand period in some of those places or in higher-demand periods. 
So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years, before our capacity expansion, there are areas due to logistical difficulties, we had -- we weren't able to reach. And so we added capacity. We have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets, and then started targeting places where we should participate. And we're adding some tanks in California, converting some tanks in other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks in other areas where we think we should be participating. 
And Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati. Today, we're -- it's several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that, utilizing our domestically produced tons where we're logistically favored, and then the remainder is what we'll export. So we feel pretty good about that. 
We work with our customers. We have extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to 1 million tons per year. And you're right, that conversation is we want our customers to make money. They need to make money, and that's because the business that they're in is serving the farmer. We serve the wholesaler, the retailer, the co-ops that serve those farmers. 
And so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports. That is our competitor. And the position -- and then our marginal ton in some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with, Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that."

I mean, I think -- Adam, I'll give you sort of my quick take, and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this one is the companies that are -- or the region that is probably the most at risk from an economic standpoint, I think, is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas-indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off and the renegotiation with NGC has happened at higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually close as a result of not being competitive anymore. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants. 
Relative to Russian production and in the U.S., we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still, well, superior to that of ammonia. And on a dollar per nutrient ton, it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. The -- I think anyone, though, that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types, like we do, into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN, that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well. 
So our view is the -- over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer, you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer-term because it is a more capital-intensive process to make UAN than it is urea. You've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital, otherwise, people stop investing in it. 
And so we would expect margins to kind of -- once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to, as Bert said earlier, kind of net neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17, where the new capacity came on and it took 1 year or 2 to -- for trade flows to rebalance and for us to really kind of get our sea legs under us. And the same thing is going on right now globally with UAN in the European anti-dumping situation. Bert?"

Coke, Nutrien and CF are the ones that have the cryogenic storage tanks or terminals in-market. And while there's some storage at plant locations, generally speaking, it's not more than 50,000 or 100,000 tons. 
And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the 3 producers, and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively -- given a weak fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks. So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than 1 turn in the spring, it's going to push farmers toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to -- from the ammonia system. 
That said, given the weak fall, we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go. So I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for.

I mean, I think from an ESG perspective, there's 4 or 5 plants here that we're focused on. The first is that nitrogen is actually a product that is very beneficial to, from a global perspective, carbon emissions. And the reason for that is, even though agriculture, sort of, it depends upon which agency you look at, is estimated somewhere between 25% and 30% of -- responsible for 25% to 30% of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, the vast majority of that comes from land use. And so as you are cutting down carbon sequestering for us in order to cultivate those acres, you're releasing a lot of carbon and you furthermore don't have the mechanism to further sequester carbon going forward. 
And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that, in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use. And net-net, the world is a much lower-carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's #1, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of negative. 
The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon-intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on, you've got Chinese coal-based plants that shut down and that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is one of those questions you have to ask writ large instead of very locally. 
Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the 4-hour plus program, which is teaching farmers best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitrous oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon-intensity perspective. 
And then finally, we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary, yes, ESG standpoint. And we're reporting on a comprehensive GRI basis from a transparency and disclosure perspective. We're one of a very few number of companies that actually reports on the GRI index on a comprehensive basis instead of just on a spot or line item basis. So we feel very good about our ESG profile."

That said, the real marginal production costs globally is still Chinese anthracite coal. And Brent price does not really affect the Chinese anthracite coal price directly. And in fact, as Bert indicated, whether it's coronavirus or other things going on, you've seen actual coal price strengthen a little bit. So the high end of the cost curve has gone up or stayed flat relative to what looks like a bit of a windfall for some other people in more third or early fourth quartile. So it's not really affecting global pricing today, the fact that Brent has come down. Bert, you want to deal with the Indian situation?"

Big country, and they've got to feed themselves. 
And some exciting things are taking place in India with the Modi government regarding investments, infrastructure and in terms of an educated population, a growing population. So when I look at -- we look at, going forward, we expect another tender, probably in late March, early April and kind of running on the same pattern, whether being equal of continued import and being the largest importing country in the world. 
There are 2 plants that are set to come onstream at the -- kind of this year, early next year. And generally, those plants have been late. And then there have been issues with feedstock supplies, and so not sure when that overall production will come on. But there are some old -- especially the naphtha-based plants, are suspect. And so even with the increased production in 2019 -- or run rates, they have been fairly stable in their production, really, over the last 5 to 8 years. 
And so we see good things. And we've mentioned both India and Brazil in our prepared remarks on -- in terms of growth, growth of demand and not necessarily too much of an increase in supply."

And so our assets should be the last ones to turn off, not the first. And there is enough production out there on a global basis that, if we were to curtail, I wouldn't expect that to move the market a bit because there's sufficient supply elsewhere in the world. 
And so our business model is all around asset utilization. Our uptime and production efficiency and onstream factor is among the highest in the world and, certainly, the highest in the U.S. And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the asset utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. 
And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we're -- we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first. And on a full year basis, last year, we still generated 21% gross margin in our ammonia segment, which is pretty remarkable that -- in a lot of businesses that talk about that being a depressing situation, for an industrial business to achieve 21% gross margin for the full year is pretty outstanding result."

And so we've utilized that now for the second time at different points, and it's, I think, a unique forum to have that conversation that sparks further conversations.

Before we jump into commentary about the quarter and our outlook, I just want to say how good it feels to be here today. It's a beautiful sunny day in Chicago, and is both my privilege and my pleasure to be sitting around our conference table with all of the Deerfield based senior leadership team. 
Of course, we're maintaining appropriate social distance. But it's been almost 10 weeks since we closed our headquarters office, and although we have a standing conference call every day, it's great to be back together again in the same room as a team. This team has done an amazing job of not only keeping their organizations engaged in executing our business, but also keeping our people safe. 
Globally, we're an organization of 3,000 people, and we've only had a total of 4 employees test positive for COVID-19. At the end of March, 3 of our employees tested positive in our Donaldsonville plant and all spent the month of April at home recovering. I'm delighted to say all 3 have fully recovered and are back at work. 
The other individual is a very recent event and works at our Deerfield headquarters. Given this result today, I'm particularly proud of the processes and procedures this team has established to make sure we keep our people safe and our operations running. 
Lastly, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $318 million, approximately 4% higher than the same period a year ago. These results reflect the impact of higher sales volumes and lower natural gas costs, partially offset by lower product prices across all segments. The underlying story of the quarter, however, is the CF team. Our facilities are part of the critical infrastructure in all regions where we operate because we serve a vital role in helping to feed the world. Our operations employees continue to come into our facilities and run our plants while our non operations employees are supporting them remotely. The whole team is performing exceptionally well under the difficult circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We produced 2.7 million tons of ammonia in the first quarter. This is the second highest quarterly volume in the company's history and continues to demonstrate our outstanding track record of asset utilization. Most importantly, we are working safely. 
As of March 31, we achieved our lowest ever 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.34 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. As we've said many times, we evaluate the company based on full year and half year performance rather than on individual quarters. This is because weather can significantly shift volume from 1 quarter to another. Those temporary shifts tend to smooth out over longer periods. That said, we're fortunate that 2020 has started with strong volumes in Q1 and good demand in shipments so far through Q2. 
So at this point, we have good visibility on the first half of the year. As Bert will describe, we see strong nitrogen demand for the spring in North America and the U.K. 
Compared to the last couple of years through this point in the calendar, the weather has been significantly better for fieldwork and planting. And to date, we have not experienced any significant disruption to our business from the pandemic. We feel good about how the second quarter is progressing and we expect our first half 2020 total product sales volumes to be similar to the previous 3 years. 
Looking forward, there is more than the typical amount of uncertainty for the second half of the year and into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not been impacted directly by the pandemic, and we are seeing very strong agricultural demand as the global economy contracts, industrial demand does soften. However, I'd like to provide some context for the magnitude of the uncertainty we're talking about. 
First, nitrogen is the only nondiscretionary plant nutrient. Unlike potash and phosphate, which can be reduced or skipped entirely for a year, nitrogen must be applied. 
Second, our plants are some of the most efficient, lowest cost operations in the world, and we're on the very low end of the global cost curve. Further, we produce in import-dependent regions, so our logistics cost to get our products in the market are lower than imports. 
Third, North America has some of the most productive fertile farmland in the world. Additionally, the U.S. government has historically supported agriculture in times of distress. And already, there has been $19 billion of aid approved with more expected to come in the future. 
Given this, we continue to expect our full year production sales volumes will be between 19.5 million tons and 20 million tons, just like it's been in the last several years in a row. So the uncertainty is not about our sales volume, it tends to be more about price realization. And while it is true that energy prices are generally lower globally, Chinese-based anthracite coal remains the high cost marginal production in the industry. Chinese anthracite coal is currently over $7 per MMBtu on an equivalent basis. So with our gas costs currently trading below $2, we have a significant built in margin structure. 
Additionally, we're beginning to see somewhat of a supply side response with announced curtailments in -- or closures in Europe, Asia and South America. Particularly for those plants that we're principally serving industrial demand, which has softened. I said on our last conference call that we expect 2020 full year EBITDA to come in somewhere between 2018 and 2019's performance. So far this year, our first quarter results are pacing ahead of 2019. 
As I said, we also expect good volume movement in Q2 this year, but we are comping against an all-time record Q2 volume from 2019. Furthermore, prevailing prices are lower than last year, and given the additional uncertainty for the second half of this year, that leads to me to think we are likely to be more in the range of 2018's full year financial performance. 
Now there is a lot of the year still to play for, and we are off to a strong start with the business running well. So we feel really good about our situation compared to many companies in the industries out there today. 
Given the uncertainty we face in the second half of the year, we are focusing our efforts on controlling those things we can control. 
First and foremost, as always, our top priority is protecting the health and well-being of our employees and contractors at our locations. Next, we remain focused on operating safely and achieving high asset utilization. 
As you can see on Slide 6 of our materials, the CF team has delivered consistently strong performance. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced 10.3 million tons of ammonia, and sales volumes have exceeded 20 million tons, both of which are company records. 
Finally, we continue to manage the company responsibly for both the short and the long term. As Chris will describe, we are ensuring that our capital expenditures, manufacturing controllable costs and SG&A expense all reflect the broader economic environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market, then Chris will talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,664412841,1975690,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers. This allowed a strong spring ammonia application season to develop at the end of March through April. 
As we noted in our press release, we have moved the highest volume of ammonia for agricultural application for the month of April since 2015. On this day -- on 1 day this past month, we had more than 1,600 ammonia trucks, pick up over 32,000 tons of ammonia from our facilities, the highest single day volume in about 5 years. 
We believe that this level of activity and our order book going forward supports our projection for an increase in nitrogen consuming corn and coarse grain planted acres in North America. We continue to anticipate 92 million to 94 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2020. This is lower than the U.S. Department of Agricultural estimate of 97 million acres from March but it will be about 2 million to 4 million acres higher than in 2019. 
To meet this demand, we have been in constant conversations with our customers and transportation partners as we collectively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. 
From our perspective, the fertilizer supply chain is operating efficiently. This is due to the professionalism and dedication of everyone involved, including our rail and barge carriers, trucking companies and truckers, and distributors and retailers who provide these essential materials to farmers. 
We believe that global demand for agricultural use remains strong overall for 2020 growing seasons led by increased corn and wheat acres here in North America and demand in India and Brazil for urea imports. India just issued its second urea tender of the year, which we expect results for soon. The country likely won't reach last year's urea import levels, but we expect it to continue to drive market sentiment in the second half. 
Demand for urea imports in Brazil should also be positive in 2020, given that domestic production in that country is not expected to operate this year and currency devaluation makes growing corn profitable. 
As Tony said, there's a great deal of uncertainty ahead due to the negative impact to the global economy of the pandemic. We are monitoring how the pandemic will affect the global nitrogen market in the rest of the year and into 2021. 
Some of the impacts are clear today. Demand for nitrogen for industrial use such as explosives and emission abatement has declined along with economic activity. We expect demand for these products to increase as economic activity increases. In the meantime, we can leverage the flexibility of our system to change our product mix. For example, producing as much diesel -- exhaust fluid and urea liquor, as we do today, we can granulate more urea. We're also watching closely the economic impact on farmers. Challenging conditions for ethanol and feed industries have caused crop future prices to fall. We do not believe the challenges those industries face today have affected significantly planting decisions for 2020. Should those challenges persist, we would expect an impact on planting decisions for 2021. However, those decisions are at least 6 to 10 months away and will be based on conditions then, a forecast that would be difficult to make today. Additionally, any government efforts to protect farm income and the impact of crop insurance payments, will also factor into farmer planting decisions in the fall. 
Because we are seeing such high demand now, we expect to end the first half with low inventories. This will give us a great deal of flexibility for fill programs in the second half based on economic and demand considerations as farmers, customers and the industry at large, adapt to the challenges caused by the pandemic. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,664412841,1975690,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

As the pandemic developed in early 2020, we constantly evaluated our financial position to ensure we have the flexibility we needed to manage the uncertainty that we anticipated ahead. 
As we sit here today, we feel we are well positioned for this unprecedented event, both operationally and financially. This starts with the actions management has taken over the last 3 years to create a strong and flexible balance sheet. This includes reducing our gross debt by nearly $2 billion and fixed charges by $190 million compared to the beginning of 2017. We also benefit from our operational and structural advantages that support our cash generation capability. 
For the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $68 million or $0.31 per diluted share. EBITDA was $314 million and adjusted EBITDA was $318 million. 
As Tony noted in his remarks, these results reflect the positive impact of higher volumes and lower realized natural gas costs that were partially offset by lower product prices. 
For the first quarter, our cost of natural gas and our cost of sales was more than $1 lower than the same period in 2019. 
Looking ahead to the rest of 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to benefit the company and offset in part the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. 
Our trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $912 million. We remain the most efficient converter of EBITDA into free cash flow in the industry, and we expect to continue to generate substantial cash flow through the remainder of the year. We also have the liquidity we need to manage the company through the pandemic. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had about $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $753 million on the balance sheet, and $250 million available on the revolver. 
As we noted in the press release, we drew $500 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We repaid the revolver in full on April 20 when it became apparent, the credit markets had stabilized. Today, our cash balance is $500 million, and our total liquidity is over $1.2 billion, including the now undrawn revolver. 
We also continue to focus on managing our spending during this uncertain time. Our manufacturing controllable cost per ton were 10% lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we reduced certain activity in light of the pandemic, contributing to lower SG&A spending in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We expect that trend to continue throughout the year. 
We have also adjusted our capital spending plans. In line with our focus on protecting the health and well-being of our employees, we are deferring certain activities scheduled for 2020 that would have brought hundreds of contractors onto our sites. These activities may also have faced delays in receiving equipment fabricated in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as Italy. This is why we lowered our estimated range for capital expenditures in 2020 from $400 million to $450 million to $350 million to $400 million. We will not forgo any activities critical to our ability to operate safely. And we expect our capital expenditures to return to the $400 million to $450 million range annually in 2021 and beyond. 
Our capital deployment focus remains the same. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We also continue to view share repurchases as our primary way of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
As Tony and Bert both pointed out, there is uncertainty ahead. With our strong capital structure, substantial free cash flow generation and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue to do what is best for the long-term health of the company throughout the pandemic. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

What we achieved, the team did a very good job of positioning product and moving product, working with our transportation partners and terminaling system in Q1 to have product in position when it was ready to go. And we caught a wave where the urea price and then the end price valued increase in value during that March, April time period, and we sold into that. So I do think that there will still be a very healthy carry going into -- through Q2 for those inland positions just because of the logistical difficulties of getting products for this volume of acreage that needs to be planted and fertilized through June. So I would expect that the normal premiums we see, let's say, $30 for the interior will probably be extended, and expanded and continue that for the quarter. Our expectations for fill. We've done a lot of different things in fill programs over the years in terms of when they start, duration, volume. And what -- when we look at those things, it's -- with the view of an economic value, what is the value to the company and what is the value and value at risk to our customers and trying to incorporate many of those questions and variability together to put together a package. It's been as small as a month of volume and as large as 6 months in volume. And so when we get to that point and again, depending on our inventory, which we expect to be low, which gives us a lot of flexibility going into that program. If the global price is low, you'll see a smaller program. If the global price and then the NOLA price is better, you'll see a bigger program. And then we'll flex the production mix accordingly."

So in terms of the shape of the cost curve or the supply curve, it's pretty clear that there's been some massive dislocations in the energy market lately when you've got for a period of time, oil trading at on a spot basis, negative numbers. And things just cratering. Obviously, there's been a lot of craziness going on out there. But sort of the longer-term dynamics that we firmly believe in is now that oil is back in the, call it, $30 range. The LNG based contracts that are linked against oil are well above where Henry Hub is priced today. And then the spot price of LNG on the sort of extraneous cargoes, there's been some sloppiness in there. So we've actually paid, believe it or not, some days in this last quarter, U.K. gas cost below what we've been paying at Henry Hub, and that is almost unprecedented from -- at least from my time in this industry. So there has been some strange occurrences, but we think that, that's really just sloppiness in terms of inventory working its way through the system on the LNG side. So again, oil index contracts are trading well above where our hub is. And eventually, the inventory of LNG works its way through the system and replacement economics because all of that spot gas is coming from NOLA has to trade at NOLA Plus. So our view is as you see beginnings of the economy on a global basis, kind of recovering, you'll see energy prices kind of stabilize and come back up a bit. And then the rest of the world from a spot LNG standpoint will be above where NOLA is. So we'll continue to operate at the very low end, and you'll probably see some increase in terms of the slope of the curve. Now the high end of the curve has been established by Chinese anthracite. As I said in my remarks, that's above $7 or $7.25 or something today on an equivalent basis. Even if it softens a little bit, we still have a really substantial cushion with less than $2 at hub today. And then we got basis differentials that put us at lower cost yet still inland. And in our view is with gas at the $30 range or maybe even strengthening a bit, there's an awful lot of wet gas plays that come back into profitability at that point. So we're not taking a doom and gloom view of where U.S. natural gas trades. And we think the rest of the world will likely be paying higher prices compared to where we are over the mid-to-long term."

I think last year, total exports were in the range of about 5 million tons. This year, we're expecting somewhere in the 3 million to 4 million tons coming out of China. So we actually think there's going to be a reduction in the amount of materials coming out of China this year. I think part of what's going on with the -- with the softening in urea pricing is given the fact that we've had really favorable early spring weather in the U.K. and also in the U.S. There's been a lot of field work that's happened earlier in the year and what people are afraid of in the channel is ending up with inventory and material that cascades over past planting into the -- into the fall. So I think you're seeing kind of a lot of just-in-time purchases where they can do back-to-back and get it out the door again because they don't want to be holding material and that's led to a little bit of softening. Prompt shipments is much stronger than if you're talking about plus 60 days in terms of pricing, and I think that, that's tended to weigh on things a little bit. But we're very constructive in terms of -- on the supply side, we think you're not going to see some of the new plant start-ups that had originally been planned for the year.

And so the total tonnage that we produce is very consistent, and we can really only sell what we make, right? So our sales volumes don't shift much. The change between $19.3 million, $19.5 million, $20 million, a lot of that has to do with product mix because the more ammonia and urea you sell, the more nutrient content is going out the door. So the less total number of tons you're selling. The more UAN, you sell, the more product tons throughout the door. So as Bert tweak the dials on what the product mix is, it changes our volumes a little bit, but it's very consistent, right in that range. So the -- the change in expectations for the year is all being driven off of the price side. And that's -- if you look at where our pricing is today versus where it was a year ago, we're softer across the board. And even though gas prices down a lot relative to where it was. And as Chris mentioned, our controllable costs across all segments are down quite a bit relative to where they were.

Steve, one of the things is the costs are allocated on a manufacturing cost basis. As you know, everything starts with ammonia. So the ammonia cost structure just flows through to the other products, and then we go from there. So it's not a cost allocation piece. It really is a couple of things, 1 of which is ag ammonia tends to be pretty good pricing and industrial ammonia, particularly right now, if you look at where Black Sea price is and even Tampa price is, very low price. And that's why you're seeing industrial contract based ammonia production around the world shut in because it's not competitive. And so in quarters where we're doing less ag ammonia, you'd expect ammonia gross margins to be compressed because the sales volume is going to be driven off of the industrial sales. And again, as we talked about deepwater traded, industrial kind of ammonia is cheap. In quarters where we have a much higher percentage of our ammonia business being done by ag, then you'll see that margin expand back out again. And ag application of ammonia, it's a very seasonal thing. And so you get a little bit of it in Q1, that spreads into Q2. The really big days of shipment that Bert was talking about where April day is. So we're going to have more ag shipments of ammonia in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter. And then sometimes we see a little bit in Q4 as well. But largely, Q3 is almost 100% of it than a little bit of side dress here and there, almost 100% industrial, and a big chunk of Q1 is also industrial. So the product that's going to have the most variability and seasonality across the year is going to be ammonia. And that's also one for which the U.S. is really the biggest and almost only market for direct application for agricultural use. So there's not a lot of other places to take that product other than here. So we're very fortunate that we've got our big terminaling and distribution network across the U.S. It represents a great value to farmers. It's one of the reasons why they put ammonia down because it tends to be the cheapest form of nutrients that they can apply to their fields. So it's a good value to them. And we're pleased with that."

And that's really a couple of fold there, similar to what I talked about with our own CapEx. That being a lot of the fabricators that produce the vessels and the equipment for these particular projects have been in lockdown mode. Some of which are beginning to come back on in Northern Italy. But then additionally, with that, it's the amount of contract workers that come on site. So I think our expectations over and above the general delays that we see just by these projects running longer than what people estimate is going to be that there's just going to be an overall shift along with probably continued curtailments, specifically for those that are oriented towards industrial production."

But obviously, a lot of uncertainties as to the outlook for corn next year given feed and ethanol outlook. So how do you see those 2 playing out this year? Do you think it's going to be above trend fall season for ammonia in the U.S.? And then just one cash flow question. Are share repurchases off the table in the interim, just given some of the uncertainty out there in the market right now?"

Regarding the fall season, you're correct, we are seeing -- and with the planting information that just came out this week, we are ahead, at over 50%. I expect that trend to continue with the weather we're seeing. And so looking towards fall with a good dry out. We would see the beans and corn coming off of those with corn on corn or following beans with corn. We would expect to see -- you talk about the season, what is a healthy fall season because we've had several be interrupted by bad weather or different circumstances. And so we are looking forward to the fall, and we think ammonia will be priced attractively. And those who are -- who have been able to apply to have been rewarded with being able to get in the fields on time and plant for spring. So we expect probably a healthy ammonia season for the fall. And the outlook for corn, I think when you look at where we are today on the board with kind of the harvest price at $3.30 to $3.35 today. You're getting close to a low number with -- or a number that is -- you get below $3, it's difficult for any rented land to be profitable. When you throw back in government payments, and like Tony said, $19 billion to date, we're expecting more on top of that. When you throw in all of the costs for a farmer and all of the revenue options with revenue guarantee program that said in the February at $370 million. You can make a pretty good case for this year's harvest and the profitability coming off the farm. And then next year with what acres would be being hopefully above this level. So like we said, we're structurally positive for this year and then watching but anticipating, not as bad as what everybody is thinking or saying for 2021."

And particularly given where the share price is and the fact that, that is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, it's something that we're spending a lot of time talking about. I will say, just given the broader uncertain global economic outlook, we're probably going to air a little bit on the side of caution. But I think it's certainly available to us. And as the balance of the year unfolds, if fill program comes in, in somewhat of a normal fashion, although that's kind of a -- an oxymoron, given that every single year in fill is different from the previous year. So I'm not quite sure what normal looks like. But as long as we're comfortable in terms of cash flow generation and where the year is trending.

We've moderated production a little bit for increased urea. But what we've done and what we're going to do is continue to expand our terminal operation where we can reach markets. We probably weren't that focused on, like California, the P&W and the East Coast and plan to continue to do that. So for what we're seeing in UAN overall on demand, is some positive things in South America and Brazil and Argentina and as well as in the United States. In production, with what Akron has done, dropping in a urea granulation unit, we anticipate fewer tons coming from the -- from Russia into North America over time. And that makes sense as we stay around the 90 million-acre plus or minus range, the demand for UAN is about $15 million. We should be importing about 2 million tons, and we will be an import-dependent market, and that can be supplied by a few of the suppliers that we have today."

Let me -- we can only talk about the maintenance aspect of it. So for instance, as Chris mentioned in his remarks earlier, we've got some new vessels, replacement vessels on things like high-temperature shift and so forth that are being fabricated in Northern Italy because those are some of the premier shops in the world that do this kind of work. And obviously, with Northern Italy went on locked down, they noticed force majeure that all those deliveries were going to get extended out in time. And so part of the issue is critical spares or critical equipment that was coming to us to be installed during turnaround activity didn't reach us. And the other piece was we didn't want to have 500 contractors in sort of a relatively hot spot area of NOLA in the Gulf Coast show up in our facilities and put our employees at risk. And so for us, what we're doing is not really deferring. We're just waiting until we get the right equipment. And until we feel we can bring people into the facility in a manner that's safe. And I think that, that probably more of that is happening than last on a global basis. So I would think now for us, because we're very much focused on high uptime, high onstream. We do preventative maintenance. We don't run stuff until it breaks. I think we're going to be fine relative to not having any kind of unusual outages relative to our plants equipment. I think other people that run a little closer to the edge could well see significant downtime. And that's another piece that doesn't always get calced into the supply side equation, but there's a lot of companies that don't really run their asset plants on a basis that is really long-term thinking about high onstream. And so as you start deferring some of this maintenance or putting it out, you're going to get a lot more kind of break fix issues, which tend to lead to a lot of up and downtime. So overall, I would expect industry operating rates to drop over the next couple of years for that reason. And it's not obvious that things are going to return to normal anytime soon. So it could -- this trend could push out not just from '20 into '21, but it could be sort of a cascade effect over the next couple of years, I think. Chris, or."

So having seen this beginning to go and even prior to that, we started to take a focus on really what are the essential projects we need to be working on and only working on the critical projects. So you saw less maintenance spending because of the asset utilization, but less engineering and professional services spent because of the focus we had on what we really needed to be focusing on. So the expectation is that we'll probably continue with the lower controllable costs than what we've had in the previous year for over the next quarters. In addition to that, one of the elements that I talked about also in the remarks was on SG&A, too, just given the level of travel. As you look at Q1, we were down about $4 million quarter-over-quarter. And that was really before any impact of the closed office. As Tony mentioned, we didn't close the office until mid-March. So the expectations would be our run rate on Q1 SG&A, maybe a little south of that, too, that will provide us some cushion.

Before we jump into commentary about the quarter and our outlook, I just want to say how good it feels to be here today. It's a beautiful sunny day in Chicago, and it is both my privilege and my pleasure to be sitting around our conference table with all of the Deerfield-based senior leadership team. Of course, we're maintaining appropriate social distance. But it's been almost 10 weeks since we closed our headquarters office, and although we have a standing conference call every day, it's great to be back together again in the same room as a team. 
This team has done an amazing job of not only keeping their organizations engaged in executing our business, but also keeping our people safe. Globally, we're an organization of 3,000 people, and we've only had a total of 4 employees test positive for COVID-19. At the end of March, 3 of our employees tested positive in our Donaldsonville plant and all spent the month of April at home recovering. I'm delighted to say all 3 have fully recovered and are back at work. The other individual is a very recent event and works in our Deerfield headquarters. Given this result today, I'm particularly proud of the processes and procedures this team has established to make sure we keep our people safe and our operations running. 
Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2020 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $318 million, approximately 4% higher than the same period a year ago. These results reflect the impact of higher sales volumes and lower natural gas costs, partially offset by lower product prices across all segments. 
The underlying story of the quarter, however, is the CF team. Our facilities are part of the critical infrastructure in all regions where we operate because we serve a vital role in helping to feed the world. Our operations employees continue to come into our facilities and run our plants while our non-operations employees are supporting them remotely. The whole team is performing exceptionally well under the difficult circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We produced 2.7 million tons of ammonia in the first quarter. This is the second highest quarterly volume in the company's history and continues to demonstrate our outstanding track record of asset utilization. Most importantly, we are working safely. As of March 31, we achieved our lowest-ever 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.34 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. 
As we've said many times, we evaluate the company based on full year and half year performance rather than on individual quarters. This is because weather can significantly shift volume from one quarter to another. Those temporary shifts tend to smooth out over longer periods. That said, we're fortunate that 2020 has started with strong volumes in Q1 and good demand in shipments so far through Q2. 
So at this point, we have good visibility on the first half of the year. As Bert will describe, we see strong nitrogen demand for the spring in North America and the U.K. Compared to the last couple of years through this point in the calendar, the weather has been significantly better for fieldwork and planting. And to date, we have not experienced any significant disruption to our business from the pandemic. We feel good about how the second quarter is progressing, and we expect our first half 2020 total product sales volumes to be similar to the previous 3 years. 
Looking forward, there is more than the typical amount of uncertainty for the second half of the year and into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not been impacted directly by the pandemic, and we are seeing very strong agricultural demand as the global economy contracts, industrial demand does soften. However, I'd like to provide some context for the magnitude of the uncertainty we're talking about. 
First, nitrogen is the only nondiscretionary plant nutrient. Unlike potash and phosphate, which can be reduced or skipped entirely for a year, nitrogen must be applied. Second, our plants are some of the most efficient, lowest-cost operations in the world, and we're on the very low end of the global cost curve. Further, we produce in import-dependent regions, so our logistics cost to get our products in the market are lower than imports. 
Third, North America has some of the most productive, fertile farmland in the world. Additionally, the U.S. government has historically supported agriculture in times of distress. And already, there has been $19 billion of aid approved with more expected to come in the future. Given this, we continue to expect our full year production sales volumes will be between 19.5 million and 20 million tons, just like it's been in the last several years in a row. 
So the uncertainty is not about our sales volume, it tends to be more about price realization. And while it is true that energy prices are generally lower globally, Chinese-based anthracite coal remains the high-cost marginal production in the industry. Chinese anthracite coal is currently over $7 per MMBtu on an equivalent basis. So with our gas costs currently trading below $2, we have a significant built-in margin structure. Additionally, we're beginning to see somewhat of a supply-side response with announced curtailments in -- or closures in Europe, Asia and South America, particularly for those plants that were principally serving industrial demand, which has softened. 
I said on our last conference call that we expect 2020 full year EBITDA to come in somewhere between 2018 and 2019's performance. So far this year, our first quarter results are pacing ahead of 2019. As I said, we also expect good volume movement in Q2 this year, but we are comping against an all-time record Q2 volume from 2019. Furthermore, prevailing prices are lower than last year, and given the additional uncertainty for the second half of this year, that leads to me to think we are likely to be more in the range of 2018's full year financial performance. 
Now there is a lot of the year still to play for, and we are off to a strong start with the business running well. So we feel really good about our situation compared to many companies in the industries out there today. 
Given the uncertainty we face in the second half of the year, we are focusing our efforts on controlling those things we can control. First and foremost, as always, our top priority is protecting the health and well-being of our employees and contractors at our locations. Next, we remain focused on operating safely and achieving high asset utilization. 
As you can see on Slide 6 of our materials, the CF team has delivered consistently strong performance. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced 10.3 million tons of ammonia, and sales volumes have exceeded 20 million tons, both of which are company records. 
Finally, we continue to manage the company responsibly for both the short and the long term. As Chris will describe, we are ensuring that our capital expenditures, manufacturing controllable costs and SG&A expense all reflect the broader economic environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market, then Chris will talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers.

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers. This allowed a strong spring ammonia application season to develop at the end of March through April. 
As we noted in our press release, we have moved the highest volume of ammonia for agricultural application for the month of April since 2015. On this day -- on 1 day this past month, we had more than 1,600 ammonia trucks pick up over 32,000 tons of ammonia from our facilities, the highest single-day volume in about 5 years. 
We believe that this level of activity and our order book going forward supports our projection for an increase in nitrogen-consuming corn and coarse grain-planted acres in North America. We continue to anticipate 92 million to 94 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2020. This is lower than the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of 97 million acres from March but it will be about 2 million to 4 million acres higher than in 2019. 
To meet this demand, we have been in constant conversations with our customers and transportation partners as we collectively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. From our perspective, the fertilizer supply chain is operating efficiently. This is due to the professionalism and dedication of everyone involved, including our rail and barge carriers, trucking companies and truckers, and distributors and retailers who provide these essential materials to farmers. 
We believe that global demand for agricultural use remains strong overall for 2020 growing seasons led by increased corn and wheat acres here in North America and demand in India and Brazil for urea imports. India just issued its second urea tender of the year, which we expect results for soon. The country likely won't reach last year's urea import levels, but we expect it to continue to drive market sentiment in the second half. Demand for urea imports in Brazil should also be positive in 2020, given that domestic production in that country is not expected to operate this year and currency devaluation makes growing corn more profitable. 
As Tony said, there's a great deal of uncertainty ahead due to the negative impact to the global economy of the pandemic. We are monitoring how the pandemic will affect the global nitrogen market in the rest of the year and into 2021. 
Some of the impacts are clear today. Demand for nitrogen for industrial use, such as explosives and emission abatement, has declined along with economic activity. We expect demand for these products to increase as economic activity increases. In the meantime, we can leverage the flexibility of our system to change our product mix. For example, producing as much diesel exhaust fluid and urea liquor, as we do today, we can granulate more urea. 
We're also watching closely the economic impact on farmers. Challenging conditions for ethanol and feed industries have caused crop future prices to fall. We do not believe the challenges those industries face today have affected significantly planting decisions for 2020. Should those challenges persist, we would expect an impact on planting decisions for 2021. However, those decisions are at least 6 to 10 months away and will be based on conditions then, a forecast that would be difficult to make today. Additionally, any government efforts to protect farm income and the impact of crop insurance payments will also factor into farmer planting decisions in the fall. 
Because we are seeing such high demand now, we expect to end the first half with low inventories. This will give us a great deal of flexibility for fill programs in the second half based on economic and demand considerations as farmers, customers and the industry at large, adapt to the challenges caused by the pandemic. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,664412841,1977103,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

As the pandemic developed in early 2020, we constantly evaluated our financial position to ensure we have the flexibility we needed to manage the uncertainty that we anticipated ahead. 
As we sit here today, we feel we are well positioned for this unprecedented event, both operationally and financially. This starts with the actions management has taken over the last 3 years to create a strong and flexible balance sheet. This includes reducing our gross debt by nearly $2 billion and fixed charges by $190 million compared to the beginning of 2017. 
We also benefit from our operational and structural advantages that support our cash generation capability. For the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $68 million or $0.31 per diluted share. EBITDA was $314 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $318 million. As Tony noted in his remarks, these results reflect the positive impact of higher volumes and lower realized natural gas costs that were partially offset by lower product prices. For the first quarter, our cost of natural gas and our cost of sales was more than $1 lower than the same period in 2019. Looking ahead to the rest of 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to benefit the company and offset in part the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. 
Our trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $912 million. We remain the most efficient converter of EBITDA into free cash flow in the industry, and we expect to continue to generate substantial cash flow through the remainder of the year. We also have the liquidity we need to manage the company through the pandemic. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had about $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $753 million on the balance sheet, and $250 million available on the revolver. As we noted in the press release, we drew $500 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We repaid the revolver in full on April 20 when it became apparent the credit markets had stabilized. Today, our cash balance is $500 million, and our total liquidity is over $1.2 billion, including the now undrawn revolver. 
We also continue to focus on managing our spending during this uncertain time. Our manufacturing controllable cost per ton were 10% lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we reduced certain activity in light of the pandemic, contributing to lower SG&A spending in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We expect that trend to continue throughout the year. 
We have also adjusted our capital spending plans. In line with our focus on protecting the health and well-being of our employees, we are deferring certain activities scheduled for 2020 that would have brought hundreds of contractors onto our sites. These activities may also have faced delays in receiving equipment fabricated in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as Italy. This is why we lowered our estimated range for capital expenditures in 2020 from $400 million to $450 million to $350 million to $400 million. We will not forgo any activities critical to our ability to operate safely. And we expect our capital expenditures to return to the $400 million to $450 million range annually in 2021 and beyond. 
Our capital deployment focus remains the same. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We also continue to view share repurchases as our primary way of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
As Tony and Bert both pointed out, there is uncertainty ahead. With our strong capital structure, substantial free cash flow generation and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue to do what is best for the long-term health of the company throughout the pandemic. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Most of all, I want to congratulate them for their tremendous safety achievements. The CF team brings our do-it-right value to life every day, which continues to drive our success as a company. 
Since I've been with CF, we have faced 2 other periods of challenging conditions: first, during the financial crisis of 2008 and '09 and then the cyclical lows our industry faced in 2016 and '17. Today, CF is better positioned for the uncertain conditions associated with the pandemic than at any other time since I've been here. We have the best team and the best assets in the industry. We remain among the lowest-cost and most-efficient producers in the world, and our balance sheet and cash generation is strong.

What we achieved, the team did a very good job of positioning product and moving product, working with our transportation partners and terminaling system in Q1 to have product in position when it was ready to go. And we caught a wave where the urea price and then the N price valued increased in value during that March, April time period, and we sold into that. 
So I do think that there will still be a very healthy carry going into -- through Q2 for those inland positions just because of the logistical difficulties of getting product for this volume of acreage that needs to be planted and fertilized through June. So I would expect that the normal premiums we see, let's say, $30 for the interior, will probably be extended and expanded and continue that for the quarter. 
Our expectations for fill, we've done a lot of different things in fill programs over the years in terms of when they start, duration, volume. And what -- when we look at those things, it's with the view of an economic value, what is the value to the company and what is the value and value at risk to our customers, and trying to incorporate many of those questions and variabilities together to put together a package. It's been as small as a month of volume and as large as 6 months in volume. And so when we get to that point -- and again, depending on our inventory, which we expect to be low, which gives us a lot of flexibility going into that program. If the global price is low, you'll see a smaller program. If the global price and then the NOLA price is better, you'll see a bigger program. And then we'll flex the production mix accordingly."

Obviously, there's been a lot of craziness going on out there. 
But sort of the longer-term dynamics that we firmly believe in is now that oil is back in the, call it, $30 range, the LNG-based contracts that are linked against oil are well above where Henry Hub is priced today. And then the spot price of LNG on the sort of extraneous cargoes, there's been some sloppiness in there. So we've actually paid, believe it or not, some days in this last quarter, U.K. gas cost below what we've been paying at Henry Hub. And that is almost unprecedented from -- at least from my time in this industry. 
So there has been some strange occurrences, but we think that, that's really just sloppiness in terms of inventory working its way through the system on the LNG side. So again, the oil index contracts are trading well above where hub is. And eventually, the inventory of LNG works its way through the system and replacement economics because all of that spot gas that's coming from NOLA has to trade at NOLA plus. 
So our view is as you see beginnings of the economy on a global basis, kind of recovering, you'll see energy prices kind of stabilize and come back up a bit. And then the rest of the world, from a spot LNG standpoint, will be above where NOLA is. So we'll continue to operate at the very low end, and you'll probably see some increase in terms of the slope of the curve. 
Now the high end of the curve has been established by Chinese anthracite. As I said in my remarks, that's above $7 or $7.25 or something today on an equivalent basis. Even if it softens a little bit, we still have a really substantial cushion with less than $2 at hub today. And then we got basis differentials that put us at lower cost yet still inland. And in our view is with gas at the $30 range or maybe even strengthening a bit, there's an awful lot of wet gas plays that come back into profitability at that point. So we're not taking a doom-and-gloom view of where U.S. natural gas trades. And we think the rest of the world will likely be paying higher prices compared to where we are over the mid- to long term."

I think last year, total exports were in the range of about 5 million tons. This year, we're expecting somewhere in the 3 million to 4 million tons coming out of China. So we actually think there's going to be a reduction in the amount of material coming out of China this year. 
I think part of what's going on with the softening in urea pricing is given the fact that we've had really favorable early spring weather in the U.K. and also in the U.S., now there's been a lot of field work that's happened earlier in the year. And what people are afraid of in the channel is ending up with inventory and material that cascades over past planting into the -- into the fall. So I think you're seeing kind of a lot of just-in-time purchases where they can do back-to-back and get it out the door again because they don't want to be holding material, and that's led to a little bit of softening. Prompt shipments is much stronger than if you're talking about plus 60 days in terms of pricing, and I think that, that tended to weigh on things a little bit. 
But we're very constructive in terms of -- on the supply side. We think you're not going to see some of the new plant start-ups that had originally been planned for the year. As I said, you have seen some announcements on curtailments or shutdowns, particularly on industrial-focused plants around the world.

And so the total tonnage that we produce is very consistent, and we can really only sell what we make, right? So our sales volumes don't shift much. The change between $19.3 million, $19.5 million, $20 million, a lot of that has to do with product mix because the more ammonia and urea you sell, the more nutrient content is going out the door, so the less total number of tons you're selling. The more UAN, you sell, the more product tons go out the door. So as Bert tweaks the dials on what the product mix is, it changes our volumes a little bit, but it's very consistent, right in that range. So the change in expectations for the year is all being driven off of the price side. And that's -- if you look at where our pricing is today versus where it was a year ago, we're softer across the board. And even though gas price is down a lot relative to where it was, and as Chris mentioned, our controllable costs across all segments are down quite a bit relative to where they were, there's a lot more leverage on the price side than there is the cost side of this equation. So when prices are softer, you can't really make all of that back up on the cost side. But look, we feel very good about where we are.

One of the things is the costs are allocated on a manufacturing cost basis. As you know, everything starts with ammonia. So the ammonia cost structure just flows through to the other products, and then we go from there. So it's not a cost-allocation",398,"Yes. One of the things is the costs are allocated on a manufacturing cost basis. As you know, everything starts with ammonia. So the ammonia cost structure just flows through to the other products, and then we go from there. So it's not a cost-allocation piece. It really is a couple of things, one of which is ag ammonia tends to be pretty good pricing, and industrial ammonia, particularly right now, if you look at where Black Sea price is and even Tampa price is, very low price. And that's why you're seeing industrial contract-based ammonia production around the world shut in because it's not competitive. And so in quarters where we're doing less ag ammonia, you'd expect ammonia gross margins to be compressed because the sales volume is going to be driven off of the industrial sales. And again, as we talked about, deepwater-traded, industrial kind of ammonia is cheap. 
In quarters where we have a much higher percentage of our ammonia business being done by ag, then you'll see that margin expand back out again. And ag application of ammonia, it's a very seasonal thing. And so you get a little bit of it in Q1, that spreads into Q2. The really big days of shipment that Bert was talking about where April day is. So we're going to have more ag shipments of ammonia in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter, and then sometimes we see a little bit in Q4 as well. But largely, Q3 is almost 100% other than a little bit of side dress here and there, almost 100% industrial, and a big chunk of Q1 is also industrial. 
So the product that's going to have the most variability and seasonality across the year is going to be ammonia. And that's also one for which the U.S. is really the biggest and almost only market for direct application for agricultural use. So there's not a lot of other places to take that product other than here. So we're very fortunate that we've got our big terminaling and distribution network across the U.S. It represents a great value to farmers. It's one of the reasons why they put ammonia down because it tends to be the cheapest form of nutrients that they can apply to their fields. So it's a good value to them, and we're pleased with it."

That being a lot of the fabricators that produce the vessels and the equipment for these particular projects have been in lockdown mode, some of which are beginning to come back on in Northern Italy. But then additionally, with that, it's the amount of contract workers that come on site. So I think our expectations over and above the general delays that we see just by these projects running longer than what people estimate is going to be that there's just going to be an overall shift along with probably continued curtailments, specifically for those that are oriented towards industrial production."

Regarding the fall season, you're correct, we are seeing -- and with the planting information that just came out this week, we are ahead at over 50%. I expect that trend to continue with the weather we're seeing. And so looking towards fall with a good dry out. We would see the beans and corn coming off of those with corn on corn or following beans with corn. We would expect to see -- you talk about the season, what is a healthy fall season because we've had several be interrupted by bad weather or different circumstances. And so we are looking forward to the fall, and we think ammonia will be priced attractively. And those who are -- who have been able to apply have been rewarded with being able to get in the fields on time and plant for spring. So we expect probably a healthy ammonia season for the fall. 
And the outlook for corn, I think when you look at where we are today on the board with kind of a harvest price at $3.30 to $3.35 today, you're getting close to a low number with -- or a number that is -- you get below $3, it's difficult for any rented land to be profitable. When you throw back in government payments -- and like Tony said, $19 billion to date, we're expecting more on top of that. When you throw in all of the costs for a farmer and all of the revenue options with revenue guarantee program that's said in the February at $3.70, you can make a pretty good case for this year's harvest and the profitability coming off the farm and then next year with what acres would be being hopefully above this level. So like we said, we're structurally positive for this year and then watching but anticipating, not as bad as what everybody is thinking or saying for 2021."

We've moderated production a little bit for increased urea. But what we've done and what we're going to do is continue to expand our terminal operation where we can reach markets we probably weren't that focused on, like California, the PNW and the East Coast and plan to continue to do that. 
So for what we're seeing in UAN overall on demand is some positive things in South America and Brazil and Argentina and as well as in the United States. In production, with what Acron has done, dropping in a urea granulation unit, we anticipate fewer tons coming from the -- from Russia into North America over time, and that makes sense. As we stay around the 90 million-acre plus or minus range, the demand for UAN is about 15 million. We should be importing about 2 million tons, and we will be an import-dependent market, and that can be supplied by a few of the suppliers that we have today."

Let me -- we can only talk about the maintenance aspect of it. So for instance, as Chris mentioned in his remarks earlier, we've got some new vessels, replacement vessels on things like high-temperature shift and so forth that are being fabricated in northern Italy because those are some of the premier shops in the world that do this kind of work. And obviously, when northern Italy went on lockdown, they noticed force majeure that all those deliveries were going to get extended out in time. And so part of the issue is critical spares or critical equipment that was coming to us to be installed during turnaround activity didn't reach us. 
And the other piece was we didn't want to have 500 contractors in sort of a relatively hot spot area of NOLA in the Gulf Coast show up in our facilities and put our employees at risk. And so for us, what we're doing is not really deferring. We're just waiting until we get the right equipment and until we feel we can bring people into the facility in a manner that's safe. And I think that probably more of that is happening than last on a global basis. So I would think for us, because we're very much focused on high uptime, high onstream, we do preventative maintenance, we don't run stuff until it breaks, I think we're going to be fine relative to not having any kind of unusual outages relative to our plants and equipment. I think other people that run a little closer to the edge could well see significant downtime. And that's another piece that doesn't always get calc-ed into the supply-side equation, but there's a lot of companies that don't really run their asset, plants on a basis that is really long-term thinking about high onstream. And so as you start deferring some of this maintenance or putting it out, you're going to get a lot more kind of break-fix issues, which tend to lead to a lot of up and downtime. So overall, I would expect industry operating rates to drop over the next couple of years for that reason. And it's not obvious that things are going to ""return to normal"" anytime soon. So it could -- this trend could push out not just from '20 into '21, but it could be sort of a cascade effect over the next couple of years, I think. Chris, or..."

Obviously, it's the asset utilization that we had during the quarter, that being high, producing more tons. But then it's also on the spending. So having seen this beginning to go and even prior to that, we started to take a focus on really what are the essential projects we need to be working on, and only working on the critical projects. So you saw less maintenance spending because of the asset utilization, but less engineering and professional services spent because of the focus we had on what we really needed to be focusing on. So the expectation is that we'll probably continue with the lower controllable costs than what we've had in the previous year over the next quarters. 
In addition to that, one of the elements that I talked about also in the remarks was on SG&A, too, just given the level of travel. As you look at Q1, we were down about $4 million quarter-over-quarter, and that was really before any impact of the closed office. As Tony mentioned, we didn't close the office until mid-March. So the expectations would be our run rate on Q1 SG&A, maybe a little south of that, too. That will provide us some cushion. So everything that we can control, back to Tony's comments, we're focused on controlling."

Before we jump into commentary about the quarter and our outlook, I just want to say how good it feels to be here today. It's a beautiful sunny day in Chicago, and it is both my privilege and my pleasure to be sitting around our conference table with all of the Deerfield-based senior leadership team. Of course, we're maintaining appropriate social distancing. But it's been almost 10 weeks since we closed our headquarters office, and although we have a standing conference call every day, it's great to be back together again in the same room as a team. 
This team has done an amazing job of not only keeping their organizations engaged and executing our business, but also keeping our people safe. Globally, we're an organization of 3,000 people, and we've only had a total of 4 employees test positive for COVID-19. At the end of March, 3 of our employees tested positive in our Donaldsonville plant and all spent the month of April at home recovering. I'm delighted to say all 3 have fully recovered and are back at work. The other individual is a very recent event and works in our Deerfield headquarters. Given this result today, I'm particularly proud of the processes and procedures this team has established to make sure we keep our people safe and our operations running. 
Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2020 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $318 million, approximately 4% higher than the same period a year ago. These results reflect the impact of higher sales volumes and lower natural gas costs, partially offset by lower product prices across all segments. 
The underlying story of the quarter, however, is the CF team. Our facilities are part of the critical infrastructure in all regions where we operate because we serve a vital role in helping to feed the world. Our operations employees continue to come into our facilities and run our plants, while our non-operations employees are supporting them remotely. The whole team is performing exceptionally well under the difficult circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We produced 2.7 million tons of ammonia in the first quarter. This is the second highest quarterly volume in the company's history and continues to demonstrate our outstanding track record of asset utilization. Most importantly, we are working safely. As of March 31, we achieved our lowest-ever 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.34 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. 
As we've said many times, we evaluate the company based on full year and half year performance rather than on individual quarters. This is because weather can significantly shift volume from one quarter to another. Those temporary shifts tend to smooth out over longer periods. That said, we're fortunate that 2020 has started with strong volumes in Q1 and good demand in shipments so far through Q2. 
So at this point, we have good visibility on the first half of the year. As Bert will describe, we see strong nitrogen demand for the spring in North America and the U.K. Compared to the last couple of years through this point in the calendar, the weather has been significantly better for fieldwork and planting. And to date, we have not experienced any significant disruption to our business from the pandemic. We feel good about how the second quarter is progressing, and we expect our first half 2020 total product sales volumes to be similar to the previous 3 years. 
Looking forward, there is more than the typical amount of uncertainty for the second half of the year and into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not been impacted directly by the pandemic, and we are seeing very strong agricultural demand as the global economy contracts, industrial demand does soften. However, I'd like to provide some context for the magnitude of the uncertainty we're talking about. 
First, nitrogen is the only nondiscretionary plant nutrient. Unlike potash and phosphate, which can be reduced or skipped entirely for a year, nitrogen must be applied. Second, our plants are some of the most efficient, lowest-cost operations in the world, and we're on the very low-end of the global cost curve. Further, we produce in import-dependent regions, so our logistics cost to get our products in the market are lower than imports. 
Third, North America has some of the most productive, fertile farmland in the world. Additionally, the U.S. government has historically supported agriculture in times of distress. And already, there has been $19 billion of aid approved with more expected to come in the future. Given this, we continue to expect our full year production sales volumes will be between 19.5 million and 20 million tons, just like it's been in the last several years in a row. 
So the uncertainty is not about our sales volume, it tends to be more about price realization. And while it is true that energy prices are generally lower globally, Chinese-based anthracite coal remains the high-cost marginal production in the industry. Chinese anthracite coal is currently over $7 per MMBtu on an equivalent basis. So with our gas costs currently trading below $2, we have a significant built-in margin structure. Additionally, we're beginning to see somewhat of a supply-side response with announced curtailments in -- or closures in Europe, Asia and South America, particularly for those plants that were principally serving industrial demand, which has softened. 
I said on our last conference call that we expect 2020 full year EBITDA to come in somewhere between 2018 and 2019's performance. So far this year, our first quarter results are pacing ahead of 2019. As I said, we also expect good volume movement in Q2 this year, but we are comping against an all-time record Q2 volume from 2019. Furthermore, prevailing prices are lower than last year, and given the additional uncertainty for the second half of this year, that leads me to think we are likely to be more in the range of 2018's full year financial performance. 
Now there is a lot of the year still to play for, and we are off to a strong start with the business running well. So we feel really good about our situation compared to many companies in the industries out there today. 
Given the uncertainty we face in the second half of the year, we are focusing our efforts on controlling those things we can control. First and foremost, as always, our top priority is protecting the health and well-being of our employees and contractors at our locations. Next, we remain focused on operating safely and achieving high asset utilization. 
As you can see on Slide 6 of our materials, the CF team has delivered consistently strong performance. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced 10.3 million tons of ammonia, and sales volumes have exceeded 20 million tons, both of which are company records. 
Finally, we continue to manage the company responsibly for both the short and the long term. As Chris will describe, we are ensuring that our capital expenditures, manufacturing controllable costs and SG&A expense all reflect the broader economic environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market, then Chris will talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,664412841,2011154,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony. For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers.

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers. This allowed a strong spring ammonia application season to develop at the end of March through April. 
As we noted in our press release, we have moved the highest volume of ammonia for agricultural application for the month of April since 2015. On this day -- on 1 day this past month, we had more than 1,600 ammonia trucks pick up over 32,000 tons of ammonia from our facilities, the highest single-day volume in about 5 years. 
We believe that this level of activity and our order book going forward supports our projection for an increase in nitrogen-consuming corn and coarse grain-planted acres in North America. We continue to anticipate 92 million to 94 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2020. This is lower than the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of 97 million acres from March but it will be about 2 million to 4 million acres higher than in 2019. 
To meet this demand, we have been in constant conversations with our customers and transportation partners as we collectively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. From our perspective, the fertilizer supply chain is operating efficiently. This is due to the professionalism and dedication of everyone involved, including our rail and barge carriers, trucking companies and truckers, and distributors and retailers who provide these essential materials to farmers. 
We believe that global demand for agricultural use remains strong overall for 2020 growing seasons, led by increased corn and wheat acres here in North America and demand in India and Brazil for urea imports. India just issued its second urea tender of the year, which we expect results for soon. The country likely won't reach last year's urea import levels, but we expect it to continue to drive market sentiment in the second half. Demand for urea imports in Brazil should also be positive in 2020, given that domestic production in that country is not expected to operate this year and currency devaluation makes growing corn more profitable. 
As Tony said, there's a great deal of uncertainty ahead due to the negative impact to the global economy of the pandemic. We are monitoring how the pandemic will affect the global nitrogen market in the rest of the year and into 2021. 
Some of the impacts are clear today. Demand for nitrogen for industrial use, such as explosives and emission abatement, has declined along with economic activity. We expect demand for these products to increase as economic activity increases. In the meantime, we can leverage the flexibility of our system to change our product mix. For example, producing as much diesel exhaust fluid and urea liquor, as we do today, we can granulate more urea. 
We're also watching closely the economic impact on farmers. Challenging conditions for ethanol and feed industries have caused crop future prices to fall. We do not believe the challenges those industries face today have affected significantly planting decisions for 2020. Should those challenges persist, we would expect an impact on planting decisions for 2021. However, those decisions are at least 6 to 10 months away and will be based on conditions then, a forecast that would be difficult to make today. Additionally, any government efforts to protect farm income and the impact of crop insurance payments will also factor into farmer planting decisions in the fall. 
Because we are seeing such high demand now, we expect to end the first half with low inventories. This will give us a great deal of flexibility for fill programs in the second half based on economic and the demand considerations as farmers, customers and the industry at large, adapt to the challenges caused by the pandemic. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,664412841,2011154,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 07, 2020",2020-05-07,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert.

As the pandemic developed in early 2020, we constantly evaluated our financial position to ensure we have the flexibility we needed to manage the uncertainty that we anticipated ahead. 
As we sit here today, we feel we are well positioned for this unprecedented event, both operationally and financially. This starts with the actions management has taken over the last 3 years to create a strong and flexible balance sheet. This includes reducing our gross debt by nearly $2 billion and fixed charges by $190 million compared to the beginning of 2017. 
We also benefit from our operational and structural advantages that support our cash generation capability. For the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $68 million or $0.31 per diluted share. EBITDA was $314 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $318 million. As Tony noted in his remarks, these results reflect the positive impact of higher volumes and lower realized natural gas costs that were partially offset by lower product prices. For the first quarter, our cost of natural gas and our cost of sales was more than $1 lower than the same period in 2019. Looking ahead to the rest of 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to benefit the company and offset in part the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. 
Our trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $912 million. We remain the most efficient converter of EBITDA into free cash flow in the industry, and we expect to continue to generate substantial cash flow through the remainder of the year. We also have the liquidity we need to manage the company through the pandemic. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had about $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $753 million on the balance sheet, and $250 million available on the revolver. As we noted in the press release, we drew $500 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We repaid the revolver in full on April 20, when it became apparent, the credit markets had stabilized. Today, our cash balance is $500 million, and our total liquidity is over $1.2 billion, including the now undrawn revolver. 
We also continue to focus on managing our spending during this uncertain time. Our manufacturing controllable cost per ton were 10% lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we reduced certain activity in light of the pandemic, contributing to lower SG&A spending in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We expect that trend to continue throughout the year. 
We have also adjusted our capital spending plans. In line with our focus on protecting the health and well-being of our employees, we are deferring certain activities scheduled for 2020 that would have brought hundreds of contractors onto our sites. These activities may also have faced delays in receiving equipment fabricated in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as Italy. This is why we lowered our estimated range for capital expenditures in 2020 from $400 million to $450 million to $350 million to $400 million. We will not forgo any activities critical to our ability to operate safely. And we expect our capital expenditures to return to the $400 million to $450 million range annually in 2021 and beyond. 
Our capital deployment focus remains the same. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We also continue to view share repurchases as our primary way of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
As Tony and Bert both pointed out, there is uncertainty ahead. With our strong capital structure, substantial free cash flow generation and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue to do what is best for the long-term health of the company throughout the pandemic. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

What we achieved, the team did a very good job of positioning product and moving product, working with our transportation partners and terminaling system in Q1 to have product in position when it was ready to go. And we caught a wave where the urea price and then the N price valued, increased in value during that March, April time period, and we sold into that. 
So I do think that there will still be a very healthy carry going into -- through Q2 for those inland positions, just because of the logistical difficulties of getting product for this volume of acreage that needs to be planted and fertilized through June. So I would expect that the normal premiums we see, let's say, $30 for the interior, will probably be extended and expanded and continue that for the quarter. 
Our expectations for fill, we've done a lot of different things in fill programs over the years in terms of when they start, duration, volume. And what -- when we look at those things, it's with the view of an economic value, what is the value to the company and what is the value and value at risk to our customers, and trying to incorporate many of those questions and variabilities together to put together a package. It's been as small as a month of volume and as large as 6 months in volume. And so when we get to that point -- and again, depending on our inventory, which we expect to be low, which gives us a lot of flexibility going into that program. If the global price is low, you'll see a smaller program. If the global price and then the NOLA price is better, you'll see a bigger program. And then we'll flex the production mix accordingly."

Obviously, there's been a lot of craziness going on out there. 
But sort of the longer-term dynamics that we firmly believe in is, now that oil is back in the, call it, $30 range, the LNG-based contracts that are linked against oil are well above where Henry Hub is priced today. And then the spot price of LNG on the sort of extraneous cargoes, there's been some sloppiness in there. So we've actually paid, believe it or not, some days in this last quarter, U.K. gas cost below what we've been paying at Henry Hub. And that is almost unprecedented from -- at least from my time in this industry. 
So there has been some strange occurrences, but we think that, that's really just sloppiness in terms of inventory working its way through the system on the LNG side. So again, the oil index contracts are trading well above where hub is. And eventually, the inventory of LNG works its way through the system and replacement economics because all of that spot gas is coming from NOLA has to trade at NOLA plus. 
So our view is, as you see beginnings of the economy on a global basis, kind of recovering, you'll see energy prices kind of stabilize and come back up a bit. And then the rest of the world, from a spot LNG standpoint, will be above where NOLA is. So we'll continue to operate at the very low end, and you'll probably see some increase in terms of the slope of the curve. 
Now the high end of the curve has been established by Chinese anthracite. As I said in my remarks, that's above $7 or $7.25 or something today on an equivalent basis. Even if it softens a little bit, we still have a really substantial cushion with less than $2 at hub today. And then we got basis differentials that put us at lower cost, yet still inland. And our view is, with gas at the $30 range or maybe even strengthening a bit, there's an awful lot of wet gas plays that come back into profitability at that point. So we're not taking a doom-and-gloom view of where U.S. natural gas trades. And we think the rest of the world will likely be paying higher prices compared to where we are over the mid- to long term."

I think last year, total exports were in the range of about 5 million tons. This year, we're expecting somewhere in the 3 million to 4 million tons coming out of China. So we actually think there's going to be a reduction in the amount of material coming out of China this year. 
I think part of what's going on with the softening in urea pricing is given the fact we've had really favorable, early spring weather in the U.K. and also in the U.S., now there's been a lot of field work that's happened earlier in the year. And what people are afraid of in the channel is ending up with inventory and material that cascades over past planting into the -- into the fall. So I think you're seeing kind of a lot of just-in-time purchases, where they can do back-to-back and get it out the door again because they don't want to be holding material, and that's led to a little bit of softening. Prompt shipments is much stronger than if you're talking about plus 60 days in terms of pricing, and I think that, that tended to weigh on things a little bit. 
But we're very constructive in terms of -- on the supply side. We think you're not going to see some of the new plant start-ups had originally been planned for the year. As I said, you have seen some announcements on curtailments or shutdowns, particularly on industrial-focused plants around the world. And yet, our plants are running as well as they do every year, day in and day out. So we feel really good about, I think, the overall S&D balance. Bert, anything else you want to add?"

And so the total tonnage that we produce is very consistent, and we can really only sell what we make, right? So our sales volumes don't shift much. The change between $19.3 million, $19.5 million, $20 million, a lot of that has to do with product mix because the more ammonia and urea you sell, the more nutrient content is going out the door, so the less total number of tons you're selling. The more UAN, you sell, the more product tons go out the door. So as Bert tweaks the dials on what the product mix is, it changes our volumes a little bit, but it's very consistent, right in that range. So the change in expectations for the year is all being driven off of the price side. And that's -- if you look at where our pricing is today versus where it was a year ago, we're softer across the board. And even though gas price is down a lot relative to where it was, and as Chris mentioned, our controllable costs across all segments are down quite a bit relative to where they were, there's a lot more leverage on the price side than there is the cost side of this equation. So when prices are softer, you can't really make all of that back up on the cost side. But look, we feel very good about where we are. And even at the 2018 kind of range, we can generate a heck of a lot of free cash flow. And we're in good -- in a really good position."

So the ammonia cost structure just flows through to the other products, and then we go from there. So it's not a cost-allocation piece. It really is a couple of things, one of which is ag ammonia tends to be pretty good pricing, and industrial ammonia, particularly right now, if you look at where Black Sea price is and even Tampa price is, very low price. And that's why you're seeing industrial contract-based ammonia production around the world shut in because it's not competitive. And so in quarters where we're doing less ag ammonia, you'd expect ammonia gross margins to be compressed because the sales volume is going to be driven off of the industrial sales. And again, as we talked about, deepwater-traded, industrial kind of ammonia is cheap. 
In quarters where we have a much higher percentage of our ammonia business being done by ag, then you'll see that margin expand back out again. And ag application of ammonia, it's a very seasonal thing. And so you get a little bit of it in Q1, that spreads into Q2. The really big days of shipment that Bert was talking about, where April day is. So we're going to have more ag shipments of ammonia in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter, and then sometimes we see a little bit in Q4 as well. But largely, Q3 is almost 100% other than a little bit of side dress here and there, almost 100% industrial, and a big chunk of Q1 is also industrial. 
So the product that's going to have the most variability and seasonality across the year is going to be ammonia. And that's also one for which the U.S. is really the biggest and almost only market for direct application for agricultural use. So there's not a lot of other places to take that product, other than here. So we're very fortunate that we've got our big terminaling and distribution network across the U.S. It represents a great value to farmers. It's one of the reasons why they put ammonia down because it tends to be the cheapest form of nutrients that they can apply to their fields. So it's a good value to them, and we're pleased with it."

And those who are -- who have been able to apply have been rewarded with being able to get in the fields on time and plant for spring. So we expect probably, a healthy ammonia season for the fall. 
And the outlook for corn, I think when you look at where we are today on the board with kind of a harvest price at $3.30 to $3.35 today, you're getting close to a low number with -- or a number that is -- you get below $3, it's difficult for any rented land to be profitable. When you throw back in government payments -- and like Tony said, $19 billion to date, we're expecting more on top of that. When you throw in all of the costs for a farmer and all of the revenue options with revenue guarantee program said in the February at $3.70, you can make a pretty good case for this year's harvest and the profitability coming off the farm and then next year with what acres would be, being hopefully above this level. So like we said, we're structurally positive for this year and then, watching but anticipating, not as bad as what everybody is thinking or saying for 2021."

We think that, that's completely ample to be able to support the kind of ups and downs in the business as we move forward. And as Chris said, we've generated some good cash flow here. Year-to-date, we're at $500 million of cash on the balance sheet and an undrawn revolver today. And particularly, given where the share price is and the fact that, that is our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, it's something that we're spending a lot of time talking about. I will say, just given the broader uncertain global economic outlook, we're probably going to err a little bit on the side of caution, but I think it's certainly available to us. And as the balance of the year unfolds, if a fill program comes in, in somewhat of a normal fashion -- although that's kind of an oxymoron, given that every single year in fill is different from the previous year, so I'm not quite sure what normal looks like. But as long as we're comfortable in terms of cash flow generation and where the year is trending, I think we're going to certainly leave ourselves open to avail ourselves of taking out some price -- some shares at low prices."

We've moderated production a little bit for increased urea. But what we've done and what we're going to do is, continue to expand our terminal operation where we can reach markets, we probably weren't that focused on, like California, the PNW and the East Coast and plan to continue to do that. 
So for what we're seeing in UAN overall on demand is some positive things in South America and Brazil and Argentina and as well as in the United States. In production, with what Acron has done, dropping in a urea granulation unit, we anticipate fewer tons coming from the -- from Russia into North America over time, and that makes sense. As we stay around the 90 million-acre plus or minus range, the demand for UAN is about 15 million. We should be importing about 2 million tons, and we will be an import-dependent market, and that can be supplied by a few of the suppliers that we have today."

Let me -- we can only talk about the maintenance aspect of it. So for instance, as Chris mentioned in his remarks earlier, we've got some new vessels, replacement vessels on things like high-temperature shift and so forth that are being fabricated in northern Italy because those are some of the premier shops in the world that do this kind of work. And obviously, when northern Italy went on lockdown, they noticed force majeure that all those deliveries were going to get extended out in time. And so part of the issue is, critical spares or critical equipment that was coming to us to be installed during turnaround activity didn't reach us. 
And the other piece was, we didn't want to have 500 contractors in sort of a relatively hot spot area of NOLA and the Gulf Coast show up in our facilities and put our employees at risk. And so for us, what we're doing is, not really deferring. We're just waiting until we get the right equipment and until we feel we can bring people into the facility in a manner that's safe. And I think that probably more of that is happening than last on a global basis. So I would think for us, because we're very much focused on high uptime, high onstream, we do preventative maintenance. We don't run stuff until it breaks. I think we're going to be fine relative to, not having any kind of unusual outages, relative to our plants and equipment. I think other people that run a little closer to the edge, could well see significant downtime. And that's another piece that doesn't always get calc-ed into the supply-side equation, but there's a lot of companies that don't really run their asset, plants on a basis that is really long-term thinking about high onstream. And so, as you start deferring some of this maintenance or putting it out, you're going to get a lot more kind of break-fix issues, which tend to lead to a lot of up and downtime. So overall, I would expect industry operating rates to drop over the next couple of years for that reason. And it's not obvious that things are going to ""return to normal"" anytime soon. So it could -- this trend could push out not just from '20 into '21, but it could be sort of a cascade effect over the next couple of years, I think. Chris, or..."

Obviously, it's the asset utilization that we had during the quarter, that being high, producing more tons. But then it's also on the spending. So having seen this beginning to go and even prior to that, we started to take a focus on really what are the essential projects we need to be working on, and only working on the critical projects. So you saw less maintenance spending because of the asset utilization, but less engineering and professional services spent because of the focus we had on what we really needed to be focusing on. So the expectation is that we'll probably continue with the lower controllable costs than what we've had in the previous year over the next quarters. 
In addition to that, one of the elements that I talked about also in the remarks was on SG&A, too, just given the level of travel. As you look at Q1, we were down about $4 million quarter-over-quarter, and that was really before any impact of the closed office. As Tony mentioned, we didn't close the office until mid-March. So the expectations would be our run rate on Q1 SG&A, maybe a little south of that, too. That will provide us some cushion. So everything that we can control, back to Tony's comments, we're focused on controlling."

Before we jump into commentary about the quarter and our outlook, I just want to say how good it feels to be here today. It's a beautiful sunny day in Chicago, and it is both my privilege and my pleasure to be sitting around our conference table with all of the Deerfield-based senior leadership team. Of course, we're maintaining appropriate social distancing. But it's been almost 10 weeks since we closed our headquarters office, and although we have a standing conference call every day, it's great to be back together again in the same room as a team. 
This team has done an amazing job of not only keeping their organizations engaged and executing our business, but also keeping our people safe. Globally, we're an organization of 3,000 people, and we've only had a total of 4 employees test positive for COVID-19. At the end of March, 3 of our employees tested positive in our Donaldsonville plant and all spent the month of April at home recovering. I'm delighted to say all 3 have fully recovered and are back at work. The other individual is a very recent event and works in our Deerfield headquarters. Given this result today, I'm particularly proud of the processes and procedures this team has established to make sure we keep our people safe and our operations running. 
Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2020 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $318 million, approximately 4% higher than the same period a year ago. These results reflect the impact of higher sales volumes and lower natural gas costs, partially offset by lower product prices across all segments. 
The underlying story of the quarter, however, is the CF team. Our facilities are part of the critical infrastructure in all regions where we operate because we serve a vital role in helping to feed the world. Our operations employees continue to come into our facilities and run our plants, while our non-operations employees are supporting them remotely. The whole team is performing exceptionally well under the difficult circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We produced 2.7 million tons of ammonia in the first quarter. This is the second highest quarterly volume in the company's history and continues to demonstrate our outstanding track record of asset utilization. Most importantly, we are working safely. As of March 31, we achieved our lowest-ever 12-month recordable incident rate of 0.34 incidents per 200,000 labor hours. 
As we've said many times, we evaluate the company based on full year and half year performance rather than on individual quarters. This is because weather can significantly shift volume from one quarter to another. Those temporary shifts tend to smooth out over longer periods. That said, we're fortunate that 2020 has started with strong volumes in Q1 and good demand in shipments so far through Q2. 
So at this point, we have good visibility on the first half of the year. As Bert will describe, we see strong nitrogen demand for the spring in North America and the U.K. Compared to the last couple of years through this point in the calendar, the weather has been significantly better for fieldwork and planting. And to date, we have not experienced any significant disruption to our business from the pandemic. We feel good about how the second quarter is progressing, and we expect our first half 2020 total product sales volumes to be similar to the previous 3 years. 
Looking forward, there is more than the typical amount of uncertainty for the second half of the year and into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not been impacted directly by the pandemic, and we are seeing very strong agricultural demand as the global economy contracts, industrial demand does soften. However, I'd like to provide some context for the magnitude of the uncertainty we're talking about. 
First, nitrogen is the only nondiscretionary plant nutrient. Unlike potash and phosphate, which can be reduced or skipped entirely for a year, nitrogen must be applied. Second, our plants are some of the most efficient, lowest-cost operations in the world, and we're on the very low-end of the global cost curve. Further, we produce in import-dependent regions, so our logistics cost to get our products in the market are lower than imports. 
Third, North America has some of the most productive, fertile farmland in the world. Additionally, the U.S. government has historically supported agriculture in times of distress. And already, there has been $19 billion of aid approved with more expected to come in the future. Given this, we continue to expect our full year production sales volumes will be between 19.5 million and 20 million tons, just like it's been in the last several years in a row. 
So the uncertainty is not about our sales volume, it tends to be more about price realization. And while it is true that energy prices are generally lower globally, Chinese-based anthracite coal remains the high-cost marginal production in the industry. Chinese anthracite coal is currently over $7 per MMBtu on an equivalent basis. So with our gas costs currently trading below $2, we have a significant built-in margin structure. Additionally, we're beginning to see somewhat of a supply-side response with announced curtailments in -- or closures in Europe, Asia and South America, particularly for those plants that were principally serving industrial demand, which has softened. 
I said on our last conference call that we expect 2020 full year EBITDA to come in somewhere between 2018 and 2019's performance. So far this year, our first quarter results are pacing ahead of 2019. As I said, we also expect good volume movement in Q2 this year, but we are comping against an all-time record Q2 volume from 2019. Furthermore, prevailing prices are lower than last year, and given the additional uncertainty for the second half of this year, that leads me to think we are likely to be more in the range of 2018's full year financial performance. 
Now there is a lot of the year still to play for, and we are off to a strong start with the business running well. So we feel really good about our situation compared to many companies in the industries out there today. 
Given the uncertainty we face in the second half of the year, we are focusing our efforts on controlling those things we can control. First and foremost, as always, our top priority is protecting the health and well-being of our employees and contractors at our locations. Next, we remain focused on operating safely and achieving high asset utilization. 
As you can see on Slide 6 of our materials, the CF team has delivered consistently strong performance. In fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced 10.3 million tons of ammonia, and sales volumes have exceeded 20 million tons, both of which are company records. 
Finally, we continue to manage the company responsibly for both the short and the long term. As Chris will describe, we are ensuring that our capital expenditures, manufacturing controllable costs and SG&A expense all reflect the broader economic environment. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market, then Chris will talk about our financial position before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers.

For the first time in several years, weather patterns in North America have been relatively normal for farmers. This allowed a strong spring ammonia application season to develop at the end of March through April. 
As we noted in our press release, we have moved the highest volume of ammonia for agricultural application for the month of April since 2015. On this day -- on 1 day this past month, we had more than 1,600 ammonia trucks pick up over 32,000 tons of ammonia from our facilities, the highest single-day volume in about 5 years. 
We believe that this level of activity and our order book going forward supports our projection for an increase in nitrogen-consuming corn and coarse grain-planted acres in North America. We continue to anticipate 92 million to 94 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States in 2020. This is lower than the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of 97 million acres from March but it will be about 2 million to 4 million acres higher than in 2019. 
To meet this demand, we have been in constant conversations with our customers and transportation partners as we collectively navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. From our perspective, the fertilizer supply chain is operating efficiently. This is due to the professionalism and dedication of everyone involved, including our rail and barge carriers, trucking companies and truckers, and distributors and retailers who provide these essential materials to farmers. 
We believe that global demand for agricultural use remains strong overall for 2020 growing seasons, led by increased corn and wheat acres here in North America and demand in India and Brazil for urea imports. India just issued its second urea tender of the year, which we expect results for soon. The country likely won't reach last year's urea import levels, but we expect it to continue to drive market sentiment in the second half. Demand for urea imports in Brazil should also be positive in 2020, given that domestic production in that country is not expected to operate this year and currency devaluation makes growing corn more profitable. 
As Tony said, there's a great deal of uncertainty ahead due to the negative impact to the global economy of the pandemic. We are monitoring how the pandemic will affect the global nitrogen market in the rest of the year and into 2021. 
Some of the impacts are clear today. Demand for nitrogen for industrial use, such as explosives and emission abatement, has declined along with economic activity. We expect demand for these products to increase as economic activity increases. In the meantime, we can leverage the flexibility of our system to change our product mix. For example, producing as much diesel exhaust fluid and urea liquor, as we do today, we can granulate more urea. 
We're also watching closely the economic impact on farmers. Challenging conditions for ethanol and feed industries have caused crop future prices to fall. We do not believe the challenges those industries face today have affected significantly planting decisions for 2020. Should those challenges persist, we would expect an impact on planting decisions for 2021. However, those decisions are at least 6 to 10 months away and will be based on conditions then, a forecast that would be difficult to make today. Additionally, any government efforts to protect farm income and the impact of crop insurance payments will also factor into farmer planting decisions in the fall. 
Because we are seeing such high demand now, we expect to end the first half with low inventories. This will give us a great deal of flexibility for fill programs in the second half based on economic and the demand considerations as farmers, customers and the industry at large, adapt to the challenges caused by the pandemic. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

As the pandemic developed in early 2020, we constantly evaluated our financial position to ensure we have the flexibility we needed to manage the uncertainty that we anticipated ahead.

As the pandemic developed in early 2020, we constantly evaluated our financial position to ensure we have the flexibility we needed to manage the uncertainty that we anticipated ahead. 
As we sit here today, we feel we are well positioned for this unprecedented event, both operationally and financially. This starts with the actions management has taken over the last 3 years to create a strong and flexible balance sheet. This includes reducing our gross debt by nearly $2 billion and fixed charges by $190 million compared to the beginning of 2017. 
We also benefit from our operational and structural advantages that support our cash generation capability. For the first quarter of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $68 million or $0.31 per diluted share. EBITDA was $314 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $318 million. As Tony noted in his remarks, these results reflect the positive impact of higher volumes and lower realized natural gas costs that were partially offset by lower product prices. For the first quarter, our cost of natural gas and our cost of sales was more than $1 lower than the same period in 2019. Looking ahead to the rest of 2020, we expect natural gas costs to continue to benefit the company and offset in part the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. 
Our trailing 12 months net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $912 million. We remain the most efficient converter of EBITDA into free cash flow in the industry, and we expect to continue to generate substantial cash flow through the remainder of the year. We also have the liquidity we need to manage the company through the pandemic. 
At the end of the quarter, the company had about $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $753 million on the balance sheet, and $250 million available on the revolver. As we noted in the press release, we drew $500 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We repaid the revolver in full on April 20, when it became apparent, the credit markets had stabilized. Today, our cash balance is $500 million, and our total liquidity is over $1.2 billion, including the now undrawn revolver. 
We also continue to focus on managing our spending during this uncertain time. Our manufacturing controllable cost per ton were 10% lower in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we reduced certain activity in light of the pandemic, contributing to lower SG&A spending in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. We expect that trend to continue throughout the year. 
We have also adjusted our capital spending plans. In line with our focus on protecting the health and well-being of our employees, we are deferring certain activities scheduled for 2020 that would have brought hundreds of contractors onto our sites. These activities may also have faced delays in receiving equipment fabricated in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as Italy. This is why we lowered our estimated range for capital expenditures in 2020 from $400 million to $450 million to $350 million to $400 million. We will not forgo any activities critical to our ability to operate safely. And we expect our capital expenditures to return to the $400 million to $450 million range annually in 2021 and beyond. 
Our capital deployment focus remains the same. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured notes on or before the maturity date. We also continue to view share repurchases as our primary way of returning excess cash to shareholders. 
As Tony and Bert both pointed out, there is uncertainty ahead. With our strong capital structure, substantial free cash flow generation and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue to do what is best for the long-term health of the company throughout the pandemic. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for a strong quarter and for their commitment and dedication, continuing to work safely and responsibly to do what we can do as part of the critical infrastructure in each country where we operate. 
Most of all, I want to congratulate them for their tremendous safety achievements. The CF team brings our do-it-right value to life every day, which continues to drive our success as a company. 
Since I've been with CF, we have faced 2 other periods of challenging conditions: first, during the financial crisis of 2008 and '09 and then the cyclical lows our industry faced in 2016 and '17. Today, CF is better positioned for the uncertain conditions associated with the pandemic than in any other time since I've been here. We have the best team and the best assets in the industry. We remain among the lowest-cost and most-efficient producers in the world, and our balance sheet and cash generation is strong. By doing the things that make us an industry leader, we will serve both our customers and shareholders well in the short term and position ourselves for continued success over the long term. 
With that, operator, we will now open the call for your questions."

What we achieved, the team did a very good job of positioning product and moving product, working with our transportation partners and terminaling system in Q1 to have product in position when it was ready to go. And we caught a wave where the urea price and then the N price valued, increased in value during that March, April time period, and we sold into that. 
So I do think that there will still be a very healthy carry going into -- through Q2 for those inland positions, just because of the logistical difficulties of getting product for this volume of acreage that needs to be planted and fertilized through June. So I would expect that the normal premiums we see, let's say, $30 for the interior, will probably be extended and expanded and continue that for the quarter. 
Our expectations for fill, we've done a lot of different things in fill programs over the years in terms of when they start, duration, volume. And what -- when we look at those things, it's with the view of an economic value, what is the value to the company and what is the value and value at risk to our customers, and trying to incorporate many of those questions and variabilities together to put together a package. It's been as small as a month of volume and as large as 6 months in volume. And so when we get to that point -- and again, depending on our inventory, which we expect to be low, which gives us a lot of flexibility going into that program. If the global price is low, you'll see a smaller program. If the global price and then the NOLA price is better, you'll see a bigger program. And then we'll flex the production mix accordingly."

Obviously, there's been a lot of craziness going on out there. 
But sort of the longer-term dynamics that we firmly believe in is, now that oil is back in the, call it, $30 range, the LNG-based contracts that are linked against oil are well above where Henry Hub is priced today. And then the spot price of LNG on the sort of extraneous cargoes, there's been some sloppiness in there. So we've actually paid, believe it or not, some days in this last quarter, U.K. gas cost below what we've been paying at Henry Hub. And that is almost unprecedented from -- at least from my time in this industry. 
So there has been some strange occurrences, but we think that, that's really just sloppiness in terms of inventory working its way through the system on the LNG side. So again, the oil index contracts are trading well above where hub is. And eventually, the inventory of LNG works its way through the system and replacement economics because all of that spot gas is coming from NOLA has to trade at NOLA plus. 
So our view is, as you see beginnings of the economy on a global basis, kind of recovering, you'll see energy prices kind of stabilize and come back up a bit. And then the rest of the world, from a spot LNG standpoint, will be above where NOLA is. So we'll continue to operate at the very low end, and you'll probably see some increase in terms of the slope of the curve. 
Now the high end of the curve has been established by Chinese anthracite. As I said in my remarks, that's above $7 or $7.25 or something today on an equivalent basis. Even if it softens a little bit, we still have a really substantial cushion with less than $2 at hub today. And then we got basis differentials that put us at lower cost, yet still inland. And our view is, with gas at the $30 range or maybe even strengthening a bit, there's an awful lot of wet gas plays that come back into profitability at that point. So we're not taking a doom-and-gloom view of where U.S. natural gas trades. And we think the rest of the world will likely be paying higher prices compared to where we are over the mid- to long term."

I think last year, total exports were in the range of about 5 million tons. This year, we're expecting somewhere in the 3 million to 4 million tons coming out of China. So we actually think there's going to be a reduction in the amount of material coming out of China this year. 
I think part of what's going on with the softening in urea pricing is given the fact we've had really favorable, early spring weather in the U.K. and also in the U.S., now there's been a lot of field work that's happened earlier in the year. And what people are afraid of in the channel is ending up with inventory and material that cascades over past planting into the -- into the fall. So I think you're seeing kind of a lot of just-in-time purchases, where they can do back-to-back and get it out the door again because they don't want to be holding material, and that's led to a little bit of softening. Prompt shipments is much stronger than if you're talking about plus 60 days in terms of pricing, and I think that, that tended to weigh on things a little bit. 
But we're very constructive in terms of -- on the supply side. We think you're not going to see some of the new plant start-ups had originally been planned for the year. As I said, you have seen some announcements on curtailments or shutdowns, particularly on industrial-focused plants around the world.

And so the total tonnage that we produce is very consistent, and we can really only sell what we make, right? So our sales volumes don't shift much. The change between $19.3 million, $19.5 million, $20 million, a lot of that has to do with product mix because the more ammonia and urea you sell, the more nutrient content is going out the door, so the less total number of tons you're selling. The more UAN, you sell, the more product tons go out the door. So as Bert tweaks the dials on what the product mix is, it changes our volumes a little bit, but it's very consistent, right in that range. So the change in expectations for the year is all being driven off of the price side. 
And that's -- if you look at where our pricing is today versus where it was a year ago, we're softer across the board. And even though gas price is down a lot relative to where it was, and as Chris mentioned, our controllable costs across all segments are down quite a bit relative to where they were, there's a lot more leverage on the price side than there is the cost side of this equation. So when prices are softer, you can't really make all of that back up on the cost side. But look, we feel very good about where we are. And even at the 2018 kind of range, we can generate a heck of a lot of free cash flow. And we're in good -- in a really good position."

So the ammonia cost structure just flows through to the other products, and then we go from there. So it's not a cost-allocation piece. It really is a couple of things, one of which is ag ammonia tends to be pretty good pricing, and industrial ammonia, particularly right now, if you look at where Black Sea price is and even Tampa price is, very low price. And that's why you're seeing industrial contract-based ammonia production around the world shut in because it's not competitive. And so in quarters where we're doing less ag ammonia, you'd expect ammonia gross margins to be compressed because the sales volume is going to be driven off of the industrial sales. And again, as we talked about, deepwater-traded, industrial kind of ammonia is cheap. 
In quarters where we have a much higher percentage of our ammonia business being done by ag, then you'll see that margin expand back out again. And ag application of ammonia, it's a very seasonal thing. And so you get a little bit of it in Q1, that spreads into Q2. The really big days of shipment that Bert was talking about, where April day is. So we're going to have more ag shipments of ammonia in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter, and then sometimes we see a little bit in Q4 as well. But largely, Q3 is almost 100% other than a little bit of side dress here and there, almost 100% industrial, and a big chunk of Q1 is also industrial. 
So the product that's going to have the most variability and seasonality across the year is going to be ammonia. And that's also one for which the U.S. is really the biggest and almost only market for direct application for agricultural use. So there's not a lot of other places to take that product, other than here. So we're very fortunate that we've got our big terminaling and distribution network across the U.S. It represents a great value to farmers. It's one of the reasons why they put ammonia down because it tends to be the cheapest form of nutrients that they can apply to their fields. So it's a good value to them, and we're pleased with it."

That being a lot of the fabricators that produce the vessels and the equipment for these particular projects have been in lockdown mode, some of which are beginning to come back on in Northern Italy. But then additionally, with that, it's the amount of contract workers that come on site.

Regarding the fall season, you're correct, we are seeing -- and with the planting information that just came out this week, we are ahead at over 50%. I expect that trend to continue with the weather we're seeing. And so looking towards fall with a good dry out. We would see the beans and corn coming off of those with corn on corn or following beans with corn. We would expect to see -- you talk about the season, what is a healthy fall season because we've had several be interrupted by bad weather or different circumstances. And so we are looking forward to the fall, and we think ammonia will be priced attractively. And those who are -- who have been able to apply have been rewarded with being able to get in the fields on time and plant for spring. So we expect probably, a healthy ammonia season for the fall. 
And the outlook for corn, I think when you look at where we are today on the board with kind of a harvest price at $3.30 to $3.35 today, you're getting close to a low number with -- or a number that is -- you get below $3, it's difficult for any rented land to be profitable. When you throw back in government payments -- and like Tony said, $19 billion to date, we're expecting more on top of that. When you throw in all of the costs for a farmer and all of the revenue options with revenue guarantee program said in the February at $3.70, you can make a pretty good case for this year's harvest and the profitability coming off the farm and then next year with what acres would be, being hopefully above this level. So like we said, we're structurally positive for this year and then, watching but anticipating, not as bad as what everybody is thinking or saying for 2021."

We've moderated production a little bit for increased urea. But what we've done and what we're going to do is, continue to expand our terminal operation where we can reach markets, we probably weren't that focused on, like California, the PNW and the East Coast and plan to continue to do that. 
So for what we're seeing in UAN overall on demand is some positive things in South America and Brazil and Argentina and as well as in the United States. In production, with what Acron has done, dropping in a urea granulation unit, we anticipate fewer tons coming from the -- from Russia into North America over time, and that makes sense. As we stay around the 90 million-acre plus or minus range, the demand for UAN is about 15 million. We should be importing about 2 million tons, and we will be an import-dependent market, and that can be supplied by a few of the suppliers that we have today."

Let me -- we can only talk about the maintenance aspect of it. So for instance, as Chris mentioned in his remarks earlier, we've got some new vessels, replacement vessels on things like high-temperature shift and so forth that are being fabricated in northern Italy because those are some of the premier shops in the world that do this kind of work. And obviously, when northern Italy went on lockdown, they noticed force majeure that all those deliveries were going to get extended out in time. And so part of the issue is, critical spares or critical equipment that was coming to us to be installed during turnaround activity didn't reach us. 
And the other piece was, we didn't want to have 500 contractors in sort of a relatively hot spot area of NOLA and the Gulf Coast show up in our facilities and put our employees at risk. And so for us, what we're doing is, not really deferring. We're just waiting until we get the right equipment and until we feel we can bring people into the facility in a manner that's safe. And I think that probably more of that is happening than last on a global basis. 
So I would think for us, because we're very much focused on high uptime, high onstream, we do preventative maintenance. We don't run stuff until it breaks. I think we're going to be fine relative to, not having any kind of unusual outages, relative to our plants and equipment. I think other people that run a little closer to the edge, could well see significant downtime. And that's another piece that doesn't always get calc-ed into the supply-side equation, but there's a lot of companies that don't really run their asset, plants on a basis that is really long-term thinking about high onstream. 
And so as you start deferring some of this maintenance or putting it out, you're going to get a lot more kind of break-fix issues, which tend to lead to a lot of up and downtime. So overall, I would expect industry operating rates to drop over the next couple of years for that reason. And it's not obvious that things are going to ""return to normal"" anytime soon. So it could -- this trend could push out not just from '20 into '21, but it could be sort of a cascade effect over the next couple of years, I think. Chris, or..."

In addition to that, one of the elements that I talked about also in the remarks was on SG&A, too, just given the level of travel.

We've learned to function pretty well on Webex and Zoom and Teams, doing conference calls and so forth. So we're going to try to keep that going. 
We have provided our employees, that have to go into the facilities every day to keep the plants running, a -- kind of the equivalent of a hazard duty pay. So we've provided sort of a monthly bonus to that group of people, and we're going to keep that in place here for the foreseeable future. So there's one element of cost that's come up. But despite that, all the other costs have come down, and we're running as a result to net positive. And I'm just really proud of the team and the organization, that they've continued to run and keep everything operating, keep themselves safe. It's really been remarkable, given the conditions we're facing out there."

Last night, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $808 million. These results underscore the resilience of our business model and the outstanding performance of the CF team. In the midst of a difficult and uncertain environment, we maintained our focus on safe and reliable operations, worked closely with all of our partners to avoid disruptions due to the pandemic. And delivered company record first half sales volumes. These efforts exemplify our team's sustained operational excellence, which, along with our position on the low end of the global cost curve, drives our cash generation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced more than 10 million tons of gross ammonia, sold roughly 20 million product tons and generated $973 million in free cash flow. 
Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. Our rolling recordable incident rate at the end of June was 0.31 incidents per 200,000 waiver hours, which is a new record low for the company. Protecting the health and well-being of our employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic remains our top focus. Our safety culture, along with the safety protocols we put in place, have kept the number of employees who have tested positive for the virus to a small number, and we have not experienced any known transmission within a CF location. We continue to have in place numerous precautionary measures across our network to protect our employees and those critical contractors who come into our facilities. In contrast to the uncertain challenges facing much of the broader economy, the nitrogen industry has performed well, driven by robust demand and low energy cost. 
And over the past few months, our outlook for the next 6 to 12 months has become both clear and much more positive. 
As you'll hear from Bert, strong demand in India and Brazil is supporting the global nitrogen market, with urea prices rising significantly in recent weeks. We are also more confident that 2021 corn plantings in the U.S. will be within a normal range. 
Chinese anthracite based production remains the high cost marginal ton. And despite all the doom and gloom prognostication over the past 12 months, suggesting coal prices in China will fall, that hasn't happened. 
As you can see on Slide 13, the cost advantage per metric ton of urea remains robust for North American producers compared to the marginal production. Additionally, we expect that the cost curve which had flattened due to lower energy cost for many producers will steepen again going forward. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. LNG exports have declined significantly. 
As this works its way through the market, production costs for Europe and Asian producers should rise. As you can see on Slide 14, futures prices suggest a return to a more normal energy differentials in Europe and Asia. As this occurs, we expect margins for North American nitrogen production to increase compared to producers in these regions, which is particularly important during periods when China isn't exporting. Longer term, we expect to remain on the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost and abundant North American natural gas. That, combined with the fact that we operate in regions which are import dependent, should enable us to continue to generate substantial free cash flow in both the short and the long term. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook. Before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

We had strong production, record sales volumes and navigated the uncertainty related to the pandemic extremely well. We had robust demand across all our products, this was supported both by higher planted corn acres than in 2019 and much more favorable planting conditions, which lengthened the application season. 
Early in the second quarter, we did see a pandemic-related decline in demand for industrial uses of our products. Strong agricultural demand and our production flexibility helped mitigate sales volume impacts. Since June, industrial demand appears to have moved closer to normal levels, especially for products such as diesel exhaust fluid. As industrial activity is closely tied to the economy, we will continue to watch this area closely and are prepared to adjust our production mix, again, if needed. Because of our heavy volumes during the first half, we ended the fertilizer year in June with very low inventories of all products. In July, we conducted our prepay and fall fill programs, all of which were in line with our expectations. We believe that those who participate will see a good return in the future given the rapidly changing and improving nitrogen dynamics in North America and around the world. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Projects 92 million acres of planted corn in the U.S. for 2020, and 5 million more acres lower than its earlier forecast. This should alleviate concerns of a substantial oversupply scenario. At the same time, demand for corn globally has increased significantly led by purchases for China. Additionally, we have seen a good recovery in ethanol production and margins, supported by an increase in U.S. vehicle miles traveled. As a result, we believe planted acres in 2021 for the U.S. as well as total nitrogen use will be similar to the 10-year average. This improved North American outlook over a few months ago has been bolstered by positive demand driven developments globally. 
Current global nitrogen market sentiment is being driven by India and Brazil. Imports of urea into Brazil are up 13% through the first half of 2020, and we expect continued strong demand through the remainder of the year and into next year. In India, urea sales from April through July are up nearly 50% over 2019 due to favorable growing conditions, which could lead to a second straight year of record urea imports. Global urea prices have risen substantially with this demand as recent Indian urea tenders have secured lower-than-expected volumes. At the beginning of August, India issued its third urea tender in 22 days and at sixth since the end of March. We believe frequent urea tenders by India could continue through the end of the year. These positive demand developments have occurred alongside important, those smaller supply developments. We have seen some high-cost ammonia production in Trinidad come off-line we are also seeing profitable delays in the startup of new capacity due to the pandemic. So as we head into the second half of the year, we feel positive about industry dynamics and, in particular, about the demand outlook. 
As always, we are prepared to leverage our manufacturing and distribution network to meet any challenges and capture opportunities that arise. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $258 million or $1.20 per diluted share. EBITDA was $786 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $808 million. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and higher sales volume. Natural gas continues to be a strong tailwind for the business. For the first half of the year, our cost of natural gas and the cost of sales was lower by nearly $1 per MMBtu and or about 30% than in the same period the year before. Management focus on strengthening our balance sheet and managing controllable costs responsibly also continues to support our results and financial flexibility. 
As we have said before, our fixed charges for 2020 are approximately $190 million lower on an annualized basis compared to 2017. Additionally, controllable cost per ton were lower in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019 and even with the special bonus we provided to operational employees from March through June. This continues to support our cash generation on a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $973 million. 
Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the first half were $563 million, and our $750 million revolver is undrawn. As we look ahead, our approach to allocating capital will continue to be balanced. This is especially important given the uncertainty in the broader economy. First, we'll continue to invest in our assets to support safe and reliable operations. As we noted in the press release, we expect capital expenditures to increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of increased scheduled maintenance and turnaround activity. These activities will also somewhat reduce gross ammonia production in the second half compared to the first half of 2020. We estimate that capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $350 million. Second, our focus in the near-term is building liquidity. And given the uncertainty in the broader environment, we expect to be above our target liquidity level in the near term. In line with this approach and similar to most companies, we did not repurchase shares in the second quarter in order to increase cash on the balance sheet. We believe this will give us the flexibility as a response to the pandemic as conditions in the economy normalize, our approach will also give us additional capacity, along with our free cash flow generation to continue to create long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

Before we move on to the questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for a strong first half.

We're extremely proud of how our team has navigated the pandemic so far, and that effort continues at all wells of the business. As I said before, in the short term, we see a much stronger nitrogen outlook over the next 6 to 12 months than we did just a quarter ago. 
Global demand is strong, and we project 2021 to have our more corn acres in the U.S. longer term, CF remains among the best positioned companies in our industry. We have an unparalleled manufacturing, distribution and logistics network that underpins our consistent operational performance. We expect to remain on the low end of the global cost curve and benefit due to operating primarily in import-dependent regions. We are also the most efficient converter of EBITDA into free cash in the industry.

So Joel, we're seeing it's pretty interesting because we've come off this year of 97 million, now it's 92 million acres of corn, a little bit weaker kind of grain and oilseed market. But amazingly, we had a fill program for ammonia, which is fairly small and then started building the book for the fall application season. As you remember, those tons sit in our inventory. So whether we sell them now or sell them in the fall. We're very comfortable with our ability to move those tons and get them into position, had to navigate a few river issues, river closures. But we feel very, very good about the ammonia season for the fall. Setting up, one with how the current crop is maturing and will come off and then have time for applications, both soybeans and corn. And then just the pricing structure. 
So what we think is a fair level for ammonia is out there and has been taken up. 
The next one is UAM, which is a bigger program. And we've had different size fill programs in the past from 1 month or 1.5 months worth of supply all the way up to maybe 4 -- let's say, 4 to 6 months. And this year was right in line with the average. We had good uptake. I think prices were very attractive, and I had those in my prepared remarks about the opportunities available to some of our channel partners. 
And so you've seen us be active in the export market. So again, a balanced approach to the market. And I think fall will kind of roll out in a good way. We're expecting in the 88 million to 90 million acres of corn for next year. So there'll be good application in the corn states. And we're also seeing with, as I mentioned, globally, what's happening with the other large agricultural markets like India, Brazil, Argentina, devaluations, coupled with support and just good pull and good movement to China from the demand side for those products like corn and soybeans as well as protein, supports a nice global level. And that's why you've seen urea bounce all the way up to now in NOLA, $250 or even $255 has been done for August. So setting up, I believe, very nicely for the fall and then into 2021."

So it's certainly something that we are focused on and spending time on. As you know, we have a pretty deep relationship with TSM Krupp UDA. They built our last 2 large expansion projects. I think they're one of the world leaders right now in the electrolyzers. And so it is conversation and investigation, we're spending a lot of time on. And it would not surprise me to see us move into a situation where we have a full slate of offering at some point here in the near future with anything from conventional ammonia to blue ammonia to green ammonia. And some various combinations. But I think longer term, it's certainly the direction the world is moving and needs to move, and I think we are going to be a significant beneficiary of that because we're that we've already got all of the back end plus logistics and capability in place.

We expected 3 million to 4 million tons for this year, and we're trending lower than that through the first 7 months of the year. So their operating rates have been around, let's say, high 60s, low 70s percent, which we equate to about 53 million to 55 million tons of available supply. Domestic consumption seems to have been higher. Similar to India, incentivizing domestic production for supply of corn and rice and other -- obviously, fruits and vegetables are about 50% of their urea demand. But that has correlated well with internal demand and they're not pushing product out to the international market. I think we -- when the market hit on a metric ton basis, $235, $240, we had expected more supply to come out of China. It did not. They've avoided the last 2 India tenders, just kind of on a perfunctory basis participated. And so looking at this tender a little open early next week, I would expect some additional tons, but those tons have now have been bid and sold in the $250, even up to $270 a ton FOB. So very supportive to the international market, very supportive trend for the remainder of the year, which we believe will be probably fewer than last year export tons and at higher prices."

It's a 365/24/7 type business for us where the agricultural applications are really a few weeks in November and 1.5 months, maybe in April and May and into June. 
For the fertilizer side, we saw a nice recovery for ammonia. We've had some difficult application years in '18 and '19 due to whether it was cold, wet weather in the fall or cold way weather in the spring, which delayed and moved some of that consumption to the upgraded products of UAN and urea. So we're pleased this year to see that and see our channel partners work with us on the custom application business.

And I think that's been shown the last couple of Indian tenders when you haven't seen huge participation coming out of China. And I think the world is operating very rationally, at least within the nitrogen industry today. As I said, we expect, given the absence of LNG cargoes, that once the surplus has kind of worked its way through the system, you'll see energy costs in Europe and Asia climbed back up to an appropriate differential off of Henry Hub again. 
And so almost regardless of whether help prices move, what we really look at is that differential cost. And that differential becomes increasingly important during periods when China isn't exporting. And so we're very constructive about what the margin structure of this business looks like going forward, which we kind of indicated the next 6, 12, 18 months look pretty positive from our perspective."

I think the nice -- I think where we are today and where we are -- I think we were projecting with the India tenders alone, taking the producer longs from North Africa and their goal into September, that kicks those positions forward, but you still have substantial buying, probably 0.5 million tons per month for Brazil through January and into February. Projections today are India will be over 10 million tons of consumption of imports, which is -- will be an all-time record. And so the rally, I believe, lasts for at this point into Q4. And then the United States has to start buying for its spring demand. And we are -- we believe the channel inventory in North America is fairly low coming out of our application season as well as production turnarounds that ours as well as others will have taken place. 
And so when you look at the cost curve, where anthracite coal is today on an MMBtu basis, that's about $6.50 to $7 on gas. And if they're able to export those numbers, those are -- that's very positive for the market because those tons are being bid in, and they need to make it all the way to the port, which are even additional cost.

So the interesting thing in Brazil is those plants, which were owned by Petrobras and Bahia or Panna and then the plant that never got started in Matagorda Sul, have been operating for decades and have been at times exporting plants, generally supplying import needs also. Those were old, inefficient without good gas sources. The plant in now, close to one new was actually supplied by a product from a refinery, which was next door. So they have been, I would say, not profitable for years. And I think through this whole rationalization process that Petrobras is going through, with their whole portfolio of assets and services, that was one area that just made sense. And there was an opportunity for another company to look and take those over and operate them, but that has not been able to happen probably due to gas supply. When you look at the available gas and gas pipeline network in Brazil compared to the United States or any western country or, let's say, European or North American opportunities. It's so small. And so -- and then the Bahia plant, for example, is just out of the market. They were trucking some of that urea all the way across the country, 1,000 miles to Montegrosso did not make sense. So shutting them down was economically intelligent as well as operationally smart. What that has done is then increase the need for imports. And it's been very good for the international market, as we've talked about in India. So we talk about Brazil. Brazil will now be close to a 7 million-ton import market for urea. That puts the U.S. market as the third largest market, India being first, Brazil second and United States third for import demand. So very good growth for that international ton to move to."

So in terms of building new green ammonia plants, that's not high on my list of things that we want to do over the next 5 years or so. The economics around that are pretty challenged, I think. And let me describe a couple of different ways that we can, though, participate in all of this. The first 1 being we are actively investigating geological sequestration for the process CO2 gas that comes out that we capture, some of which we turn into ammonia, but you can -- we can go ahead and sequester that and then get offset as a result of that and certify some set of the production like even today, as blue ammonia, if we were going to do that. Similarly then, the next step would be, you could put in some electrolyzers and put in free hydrogen either into the back end of the process or potentially in the front end of the process. And buy renewable energy in a number of our locations, which is available, wind in Port Neal, Iowa, you got hydro in Corrie, Ontario. You've got some green options in the U.K. as well. And then from that, you can actually certify some of the production as green. And all of those things are relatively low capital cost implementations in order to be able to move a section of the portfolio from conventional to green and blue. I think to do a wholesale swap out, you're basically talking about replacing the front end steam methane reformers with huge electrolyzers, and that is a lot more capital economically today, that doesn't make sense because price of North American natural gas is so reasonable compared to other prices of energy, particularly if you're talking about renewable energy. However, a lot of that is dependent upon what the price of carbon is risen. And that the high enough carbon cost or a high enough product price demand for green ammonia, you could absolutely see the justification from an economic return for doing that. So my answer to that question is we're evaluating all of these different approaches. We haven't made any announcements yet because our belief is rather than a big fanfare of kind of smoke and mirrors and vaporware. We want to wait until we've got something real that we're doing and then announce something at that point in time. But we're evaluating all of this. And we think we've got a great path forward to actually, in the very near term, be able to produce some blue land or green ammonia. But not have it be a huge capital outlay in order to get there. I think longer term, though, if you project out to, let's just take the 2050 number that a lot of people are using you could absolutely see a number of our plants be full on green, running off of renewable fuel here. And I think the benefit that we have is the capital investment in terms of the back end of the process, along with all of the storage and shipping logistics and terminaling capabilities. Is that we're in the best position to benefit from it and anything that drives demand for ammonia, whether it's green, blue or otherwise, is good for us because it just increases the price of ammonia globally. So certainly something we're excited about from a development standpoint."

It's just a matter of at what price does it get bid back into production on and what you've seen, as Bert indicated in his prepared remarks early on is when deepwater ammonia prices crashed in response, partly to the pandemic situation. You've seen high-cost producers shut down in Trinidad and actually in other parts of the world. And so -- and similarly, when you've had these new plants come online in India, you've had other plants, whether it's Brazil or India or other places in the world shut it out. So while there's tremendous microscopic attention paid to the specifics on supply demand, what ultimately happens in the situation is the market rationalizes how much supply is ultimately available because the high cost production shuts down and where that high-cost production is actually moves around a little bit because Trinidad was viewed as first or second quarter quartile assets for a long time up until just recently, and now they're the ones that are actually shutting down. And so what I would suggest is, while all of the time lines to build, have lengthened substantially and availability of some parts have been pushed out into the future, making it difficult for some people probably to operate. That generally speaking, it's going to be the cost curve and the slope of the energy differentials that are going to drive what the margin opportunity is, not whether there's an extra plant coming on and Turkmenistan or not.

Just curious, given the solid first half, the dynamics you're seeing in the market today, kind of inflection and positivity can we get to the upper end of that range in your opinion? And given kind of flat to down a little bit year-on-year, corn acres into 2021, and maybe a bit better pricing dynamics, how would you encourage folks to think about 2021 EBITDA levels?"

Last night, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $808 million. These results underscore the resilience of our business model and the outstanding performance of the CF team. In the midst of a difficult and uncertain environment, we maintained our focus on safe and reliable operations, worked closely with all of our partners to avoid disruptions due to the pandemic. And delivered company record first half sales volumes. These efforts exemplify our team's sustained operational excellence, which, along with our position on the low end of the global cost curve, drives our cash generation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced more than 10 million tons of gross ammonia, sold roughly 20 million product tons and generated $973 million in free cash flow. 
Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. Our rolling recordable incident rate at the end of June was 0.31 incidents per 200,000 waiver hours, which is a new record low for the company. Protecting the health and well-being of our employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic remains our top focus. Our safety culture, along with the safety protocols we put in place, have kept a number of employees who have tested positive for the virus to a small number, and we have not experienced any known transmission within a CF location. We continue to have in place numerous precautionary measures across our network to protect our employees and those critical contractors who come into our facilities. In contrast to the uncertain challenges facing much of the broader economy, the nitrogen industry has performed well, driven by robust demand and low energy cost. 
And over the past few months, our outlook for the next 6 to 12 months has become both clear and much more positive. 
As you'll hear from Bert, strong demand in India and Brazil is supporting the global nitrogen market, with urea prices rising significantly in recent weeks. We are also more confident that 2021 corn planted in the U.S. will be within a normal range. 
Chinese anthracite based production remains the high cost marginal ton. And despite all the doom and gloom prognostication over the past 12 months, suggesting coal prices in China will fall, that hasn't happened. 
As you can see on Slide 13, the cost advantage per metric ton of urea remains robust for North American producers compared to the marginal production. Additionally, we expect that the cost curve which had flattened due to lower energy cost for many producers will steepen again going forward. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. LNG exports have declined significantly. 
As this works its way through the market, production costs for Europe and Asian producers should rise. As you can see on Slide 14, futures prices suggest a return to a more normal energy differentials in Europe and Asia. As this occurs, we expect margins for North American nitrogen production to increase compared to producers in these regions, which is particularly important during periods when China isn't exporting. Longer term, we expect to remain on the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost and abundant North American natural gas. That, combined with the fact that we operate in regions which are import dependent, should enable us to continue to generate substantial free cash flow in both the short and the long term. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook. Before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,679030874,2064168,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

We had strong production, record sales volumes and navigated the uncertainty related to the pandemic extremely well. We had robust demand across all our products, this was supported both by higher planted corn acres than in 2019 and much more favorable planting conditions, which lengthened the application season. 
Early in the second quarter, we did see a pandemic-related decline in demand for industrial uses of our products. Strong agricultural demand and our production flexibility helped mitigate sales volume impacts. Since June, industrial demand appears to have moved closer to normal levels, especially for products such as diesel exhaust fluid. As industrial activity is closely tied to the economy, we will continue to watch this area closely and are prepared to adjust our production mix, again, if needed. Because of our heavy volumes during the first half, we ended the fertilizer year in June with very low inventories of all products. In July, we conducted our prepay and fall fill programs, all of which were in line with our expectations. We believe that those who participated will see a good return in the future given the rapidly changing and improving nitrogen dynamics in North America and around the world. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects 92 million acres of planted corn in the U.S. for 2020, 5 million more acres lower than its earlier forecast. This should alleviate concerns of a substantial oversupply scenario. At the same time, demand for corn globally has increased significantly led by purchases for China. Additionally, we have seen a good recovery in ethanol production and margins, supported by an increase in U.S. vehicle miles traveled. As a result, we believe planted acres in 2021 for the U.S. as well as total nitrogen used will be similar to the 10-year average. This improved North American outlook over a few months ago has been bolstered by positive demand driven developments globally. 
Current global nitrogen market sentiment is being driven by India and Brazil. Imports of urea into Brazil are up 13% through the first half of 2020, and we expect continued strong demand through the remainder of the year and into next year. In India, urea sales from April through July are up nearly 50% over 2019 due to favorable growing conditions, which could lead to a second straight year of record urea imports. Global urea prices have risen substantially with this demand as recent Indian urea tenders have secured lower-than-expected volumes. At the beginning of August, India issued its third urea tender in 22 days and at sixth since the end of March. We believe frequent urea tenders by India could continue through the end of the year. These positive demand developments have occurred alongside important though smaller supply developments. We have seen some high-cost ammonia production in Trinidad come off-line, we are also seeing profitable delays in the startup of new capacity due to the pandemic. So as we head into the second half of the year, we feel positive about industry dynamics and, in particular, about the demand outlook. 
As always, we are prepared to leverage our manufacturing and distribution network to meet any challenges and capture opportunities that arise. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $258 million or $1.20 per diluted share. EBITDA was $786 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $808 million. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and higher sales volume. Natural gas continues to be a strong tailwind for the business. For the first half of the year, our cost of natural gas in the cost of sales was lower by nearly $1 per MMBtu and or about 30% than in the same period the year before. Management focus on strengthening our balance sheet and managing controllable costs responsibly also continues to support our results and financial flexibility. 
As we have said before, our fixed charges for 2020 are approximately $190 million lower on an annualized basis compared to 2017. Additionally, controllable cost per ton were lower in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019, even with the special bonus we provided to operational employees from March through June. This continues to support our cash generation on a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $973 million. 
Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the first half were $563 million, and our $750 million revolver is undrawn. As we look ahead, our approach to allocating capital will continue to be balanced. This is especially important given the uncertainty in the broader economy. First, we'll continue to invest in our assets to support safe and reliable operations. As we noted in the press release, we expect capital expenditures to increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of increased scheduled maintenance and turnaround activity. These activities will also somewhat reduce gross ammonia production in the second half compared to the first half of 2020. We estimate that capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $350 million. Second, our focus in the near-term is building liquidity. And given the uncertainty in the broader environment, we expect to be above our target liquidity level in the near term. In line with this approach and similar to most companies, we did not repurchase shares in the second quarter in order to increase cash on the balance sheet. We believe this will give us the flexibility as a response to the pandemic. As conditions in the economy normalize, our approach will also give us additional capacity, along with our free cash flow generation to continue to create long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

We have an unparalleled manufacturing, distribution and logistics network that underpins our consistent operational performance.

So Joel, we're seeing it's pretty interesting because we've come off this year of 97 million, now it's 92 million acres of corn, a little bit weaker kind of grain and oilseed market. But amazingly, we had a fill program for ammonia, which is fairly small and then started building the book for the fall application season. As you remember, those tons sit in our inventory. So whether we sell them now or sell them in the fall. We're very comfortable with our ability to move those tons and get them into position, had to navigate a few river issues, river closures. But we feel very, very good about the ammonia season for the fall. Setting up, one with how the current crop is maturing and will come off and then have time for applications, both soybeans and corn. And then just the pricing structure. 
So what we think is a fair level for ammonia is out there and has been taken up. 
The next one is UAN, which is a bigger program. And we've had different size fill programs in the past from 1 month or 1.5 months’ worth of supply all the way up to maybe 4 -- let's say, 4 to 6 months. And this year was right in line with the average. We had good uptake. I think prices were very attractive, and I had those in my prepared remarks about the opportunities available to some of our channel partners. 
And so you've seen us be active in the export market. So again, a balanced approach to the market. And I think fall will kind of roll out in a good way. We're expecting in the 88 million to 90 million acres of corn for next year. So there'll be good application in the corn states. And we're also seeing with, as I mentioned, globally, what's happening with the other large agricultural markets like India, Brazil, Argentina, devaluations, coupled with support and just good pull and good movement to China on the demand side for those products like corn and soybeans as well as protein, supports a nice global level. And that's why you've seen urea bounce all the way up to now in NOLA, $250 or even $255 has been done for August. So setting up, I believe, very nicely for the fall and then into 2021."

So it's certainly something that we are focused on and spending time on. As you know, we have a pretty deep relationship with Thyssenkrupp Uhde. They built our last 2 large expansion projects. I think they're one of the world leaders right now in the electrolysis. And so it is conversation and investigation, we're spending a lot of time on. And it would not surprise me to see us move into a situation where we have a full slate of offering at some point here in the near future with anything from conventional ammonia to blue ammonia to green ammonia. And some various combinations. But I think longer term, it's certainly the direction the world is moving and needs to move, and I think we are going to be a significant beneficiary of that because we're that -- we've already got all of the back end plus logistics and capability in place.

We expected 3 million to 4 million tons for this year, and we're trending lower than that through the first 7 months of the year. So their operating rates have been around, let's say, high 60s, low 70s percent, which we equate to about 53 million to 55 million tons of available supply. Domestic consumption seems to have been higher. Similar to India, incentivizing domestic production for supply of corn and rice and other -- obviously, fruits and vegetables are about 50% of their urea demand. But that has correlated well with internal demand and they're not pushing product out to the international market. I think when the market hit on a metric ton basis, $235, $240, we had expected more supply to come out of China. It did not. They've avoided the last 2 India tenders, just kind of on a perfunctory basis participated. And so looking at this tender that will open early next week, I would expect some additional tons, but those tons have now have been bid and sold in the $250, even up to $270 a ton FOB. So very supportive to the international market, very supportive trend for the remainder of the year, in which we believe will be probably fewer than last year export tons and at higher prices."

One, like you mentioned, is the industrial side, which if you can include and upgrades for that segment, ammonium nitrate urea, UAN.

We're seeing that recover and seeing a good pull from our customers for that part of our business, which is a healthy percentage of our ammonia business. It's a 365/24/7 type business for us where the agricultural applications are really a few weeks in November and 1.5 months, maybe in April and May and into June. 
For the fertilizer side, we saw a nice recovery for ammonia. We've had some difficult application years in '18 and '19 due to whether it was cold, wet weather in the fall or cold weather in the spring, which delayed and moved some of that consumption to the upgraded products of UAN and urea.

That's above where we are today. So we're continuing to trade at a little bit of a discount to international parity, which is not really that uncommon given that when people need to find liquidity for cargoes, this is the place they come. That said, I think we're trading in a range that reflects actual underlying economics. And I think that's been shown the last couple of Indian tenders when you haven't seen huge participation coming out of China. And I think the world is operating very rationally, at least within the nitrogen industry today. As I said, we expect, given the absence of LNG cargoes, that once the surplus has kind of worked its way through the system, you'll see energy costs in Europe and Asia climb back up to an appropriate differential off of Henry Hub again. 
And so almost regardless of whether held prices move, what we really look at is that differential cost. And that differential becomes increasingly important during periods when China isn't exporting. And so we're very constructive about what the margin structure of this business looks like going forward, which we kind of indicated the next 6, 12, 18 months look pretty positive from our perspective. 
Yes, I agree. I think the nice -- I think where we are today and where we are -- I think we were projecting with the India tenders alone, taking the producer longs from North Africa and Arab Gulf into September, that kicks those positions forward, but you still have substantial buying, probably 0.5 million tons per month for Brazil through January and into February. Projections today are India will be over 10 million tons of consumption of imports, which is -- will be an all-time record. And so the rally, I believe, lasts for at this point into Q4. And then the United States has to start buying for its spring demand. And we are -- we believe the channel inventory in North America is fairly low coming out of our application season as well as production turnarounds that ours as well as others will have taken place. 
And so when you look at the cost curve, where anthracite coal is today on an MMBtu basis, that's about $6.50 to $7 on gas. And if they're able to export those numbers, those are -- that's very positive for the market because those tons are being bid in, and they need to make it all the way to the port, which are even additional cost. So a good floor right now for the market."

So yes, while this year looks like it's a pretty strong year from the standpoint of application. A lot of it is just, I think, the recognition that it's more efficient from the standpoint of the general industry Indian economy to be importing urea as opposed to being trying to run older, high cost, inefficient facilities. So we're -- again, we're very constructive about the direction that this whole market is headed, [ burn ] in the other. 
It's exactly right. And with the level of imports, coupled with domestic production, be an all-time high for urea consumption. But you have to remember, we're going to approach, again, 50 million tons of kind of the export market. So this is a global rally. It's not just dependent on India. There are a number of countries that are consuming more. And we've seen a few shutdowns. So it's a balanced position to what's driving. And we seem to have something like these things happen every year or 2, a positive push to the market, and we're in the middle of one. 
I think to tack on to that, in the situation where you've got the huge global disruptions like the pandemic, the move towards food security is something that most governments really want to push toward and so optimal fertilization, trying to encourage complete growth is something that is top of mind, I think, for many regimes out there. So I think, again, underpinning the strong demand in nitrogen, we've actually been in an odd way, potentially somewhat beneficiaries of the whole situation."

Those were old, inefficient without good gas sources. The plant in now, close to Paranagu was actually supplied by a product from a refinery, which was next door. So they have been, I would say, not profitable for years. And I think through this whole rationalization process that Petrobras is going through, with their whole portfolio of assets and services, that was one area that just made sense. And there was an opportunity for another company to look and take those over and operate them, but that has not been able to happen probably due to gas supply. When you look at the available gas and gas pipeline network in Brazil compared to the United States or any western country or, let's say, European or North American opportunities, it's so small. And so -- and then the Bahia plant, for example, is just out of the market. They were trucking some of that urea all the way across the country, 1,000 miles to Mato Grosso did not make sense. So shutting them down was economically intelligent as well as operationally smart. What that has done is then increase the need for imports. And it's been very good for the international market, as we've talked about in India. So we talk about Brazil. Brazil will now be close to a 7 million-ton import market for urea. That puts the U.S. market as the third largest market, India being first, Brazil second and United States third for import demand. So very good growth for that international ton to move to."

So in terms of building new green ammonia plants, that's not high on my list of things that we want to do over the next 5 years or so. The economics around that are pretty challenged, I think. And let me describe a couple of different ways that we can, though, participate in all of this. The first one being we are actively investigating geological sequestration for the process CO2 gas that comes out that we capture, some of which we turn into ammonia, but you can -- we can go ahead and sequester that and then get offset as a result of that and certify some set of the production like even today, as blue ammonia, if we were going to do that. Similarly then, the next step would be, you could put in some electrolyzers and put in pre-hydrogen either into the back end of the process or potentially in the front end of the process. And buy renewable energy in a number of our locations, which is available, wind in Port Neal, Iowa, you got hydro in Courtright, Ontario. You've got some green options in the U.K. as well. And then from that, you can actually certify some of the production as green. And all of those things are relatively low capital cost implementations in order to be able to move a section of the portfolio from conventional to green and blue. I think to do a wholesale swap out, you're basically talking about replacing the front end steam methane reformers with huge electrolyzers, and that is a lot more capital economically today, that doesn't make sense because price of North American natural gas is so reasonable compared to other prices of energy, particularly if you're talking about renewable energy. However, a lot of that is dependent upon what the price of carbon is risen. And that the high enough carbon cost or a high enough product price demand for green ammonia, you could absolutely see the justification from an economic return for doing that. 
So my answer to that question is we're evaluating all of these different approaches. We haven't made any announcements yet because our belief is rather than a big fanfare of kind of smoke and mirrors and vaporware. We want to wait until we've got something real that we're doing and then announce something at that point in time. But we're evaluating all of this. And we think we've got a great path forward to actually, in the very near term, be able to produce some blue land or green ammonia. But not have it be a huge capital outlay in order to get there. I think longer term, though, if you project out to, let's just take the 2050 number that a lot of people are using you could absolutely see a number of our plants be full on green, running off of renewable fuel here. And I think the benefit that we have is the capital investment in terms of the back end of the process, along with all of the storage and shipping logistics and terminaling capabilities, is that we're in the best position to benefit from it and anything that drives demand for ammonia, whether it's green, blue or otherwise, is good for us because it just increases the price of ammonia globally. So certainly something we're excited about from a development standpoint."

It's just a matter of at what price does it get bid back into production on. And what you've seen, as Bert indicated in his prepared remarks early on is when deepwater ammonia prices crashed in response, partly to the pandemic situation. You've seen high-cost producers shut down in Trinidad and actually in other parts of the world. And so -- and similarly, when you've had these new plants come online in India, you've had other plants, whether it's Brazil or India or other places in the world shutdown. So while there's tremendous microscopic attention paid to the specifics on supply demand, what ultimately happens in the situation is the market rationalizes how much supply is ultimately available because the high cost production shuts down and where that high-cost production is actually moves around a little bit because Trinidad was viewed as first or second quarter quartile assets for a long time up until just recently, and now they're the ones that are actually shutting down. And so what I would suggest is, while all of the time lines to build, have lengthened substantially and availability of some parts have been pushed out into the future, making it difficult for some people probably to operate. That generally speaking, it's going to be the cost curve and the slope of the energy differentials that are going to drive what the margin opportunity is, not whether there's an extra plant coming on in Turkmenistan or not.

Last night, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $808 million. These results underscore the resilience of our business model and the outstanding performance of the CF team. In the midst of a difficult and uncertain environment, we maintained our focus on safe and reliable operations, worked closely with all of our partners to avoid disruptions due to the pandemic. And delivered company record first half sales volumes. These efforts exemplify our team's sustained operational excellence, which, along with our position on the low end of the global cost curve, drives our cash generation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced more than 10 million tons of gross ammonia, sold roughly 20 million product tons and generated $973 million in free cash flow. 
Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. Our rolling recordable incident rate at the end of June was 0.31 incidents per 200,000 waiver hours, which is a new record low for the company. Protecting the health and well-being of our employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic remains our top focus. Our safety culture, along with the safety protocols we put in place, have kept a number of employees who have tested positive for the virus to a small number, and we have not experienced any known transmission within a CF location. We continue to have in place numerous precautionary measures across our network to protect our employees and those critical contractors who come into our facilities. In contrast to the uncertain challenges facing much of the broader economy, the nitrogen industry has performed well, driven by robust demand and low energy cost. 
And over the past few months, our outlook for the next 6 to 12 months has become both clear and much more positive. 
As you'll hear from Bert, strong demand in India and Brazil is supporting the global nitrogen market, with urea prices rising significantly in recent weeks. We are also more confident that 2021 corn planted in the U.S. will be within a normal range. 
Chinese anthracite based production remains the high cost marginal ton. And despite all the doom and gloom prognostication over the past 12 months, suggesting coal prices in China will fall, that hasn't happened. 
As you can see on Slide 13, the cost advantage per metric ton of urea remains robust for North American producers compared to the marginal production. Additionally, we expect that the cost curve which had flattened due to lower energy cost for many producers will steepen again going forward. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. LNG exports have declined significantly. 
As this works its way through the market, production costs for Europe and Asian producers should rise. As you can see on Slide 14, futures prices suggest a return to a more normal energy differentials in Europe and Asia. As this occurs, we expect margins for North American nitrogen production to increase compared to producers in these regions, which is particularly important during periods when China isn't exporting. Longer term, we expect to remain on the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost and abundant North American natural gas. That, combined with the fact that we operate in regions which are import dependent, should enable us to continue to generate substantial free cash flow in both the short and the long term. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook. Before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,679030874,2064194,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

We had strong production, record sales volumes and navigated the uncertainty related to the pandemic extremely well. We had robust demand across all our products, this was supported both by higher planted corn acres than in 2019 and much more favorable planting conditions, which lengthened the application season. 
Early in the second quarter, we did see a pandemic-related decline in demand for industrial uses of our products. Strong agricultural demand and our production flexibility helped mitigate sales volume impacts. Since June, industrial demand appears to have moved closer to normal levels, especially for products such as diesel exhaust fluid. As industrial activity is closely tied to the economy, we will continue to watch this area closely and are prepared to adjust our production mix, again, if needed. Because of our heavy volumes during the first half, we ended the fertilizer year in June with very low inventories of all products. In July, we conducted our prepay and fall fill programs, all of which were in line with our expectations. We believe that those who participated will see a good return in the future given the rapidly changing and improving nitrogen dynamics in North America and around the world. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects 92 million acres of planted corn in the U.S. for 2020, 5 million more acres lower than its earlier forecast. This should alleviate concerns of a substantial oversupply scenario. At the same time, demand for corn globally has increased significantly led by purchases for China. Additionally, we have seen a good recovery in ethanol production and margins, supported by an increase in U.S. vehicle miles traveled. As a result, we believe planted acres in 2021 for the U.S. as well as total nitrogen used will be similar to the 10-year average. This improved North American outlook over a few months ago has been bolstered by positive demand driven developments globally. 
Current global nitrogen market sentiment is being driven by India and Brazil. Imports of urea into Brazil are up 13% through the first half of 2020, and we expect continued strong demand through the remainder of the year and into next year. In India, urea sales from April through July are up nearly 50% over 2019 due to favorable growing conditions, which could lead to a second straight year of record urea imports. Global urea prices have risen substantially with this demand as recent Indian urea tenders have secured lower-than-expected volumes. At the beginning of August, India issued its third urea tender in 22 days and at sixth since the end of March. We believe frequent urea tenders by India could continue through the end of the year. These positive demand developments have occurred alongside important though smaller supply developments. We have seen some high-cost ammonia production in Trinidad come off-line, we are also seeing profitable delays in the startup of new capacity due to the pandemic. So as we head into the second half of the year, we feel positive about industry dynamics and, in particular, about the demand outlook. 
As always, we are prepared to leverage our manufacturing and distribution network to meet any challenges and capture opportunities that arise. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $258 million or $1.20 per diluted share. EBITDA was $786 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $808 million. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and higher sales volume. Natural gas continues to be a strong tailwind for the business. For the first half of the year, our cost of natural gas in the cost of sales was lower by nearly $1 per MMBtu and or about 30% than in the same period the year before. Management focus on strengthening our balance sheet and managing controllable costs responsibly also continues to support our results and financial flexibility. 
As we have said before, our fixed charges for 2020 are approximately $190 million lower on an annualized basis compared to 2017. Additionally, controllable cost per ton were lower in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019, even with the special bonus we provided to operational employees from March through June. This continues to support our cash generation on a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $973 million. 
Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the first half were $563 million, and our $750 million revolver is undrawn. As we look ahead, our approach to allocating capital will continue to be balanced. This is especially important given the uncertainty in the broader economy. First, we'll continue to invest in our assets to support safe and reliable operations. As we noted in the press release, we expect capital expenditures to increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of increased scheduled maintenance and turnaround activity. These activities will also somewhat reduce gross ammonia production in the second half compared to the first half of 2020. We estimate that capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $350 million. Second, our focus in the near-term is building liquidity. And given the uncertainty in the broader environment, we expect to be above our target liquidity level in the near term. In line with this approach and similar to most companies, we did not repurchase shares in the second quarter in order to increase cash on the balance sheet. We believe this will give us the flexibility as a response to the pandemic. As conditions in the economy normalize, our approach will also give us additional capacity, along with our free cash flow generation to continue to create long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

So Joel, we're seeing it's pretty interesting because we've come off this year of 97 million, now it's 92 million acres of corn, a little bit weaker kind of grain and oilseed market. But amazingly, we had a fill program for ammonia, which is fairly small and then started building the book for the fall application season. As you remember, those tons sit in our inventory. So whether we sell them now or sell them in the fall. We're very comfortable with our ability to move those tons and get them into position, had to navigate a few river issues, river closures. But we feel very, very good about the ammonia season for the fall. Setting up, one with how the current crop is maturing and will come off and then have time for applications, both soybeans and corn. And then just the pricing structure. 
So what we think is a fair level for ammonia is out there and has been taken up. 
The next one is UAN, which is a bigger program. And we've had different size fill programs in the past from 1 month or 1.5 months’ worth of supply all the way up to maybe 4 -- let's say, 4 to 6 months. And this year was right in line with the average. We had good uptake. I think prices were very attractive, and I had those in my prepared remarks about the opportunities available to some of our channel partners. 
And so you've seen us be active in the export market. So again, a balanced approach to the market. And I think fall will kind of roll out in a good way. We're expecting in the 88 million to 90 million acres of corn for next year. So there'll be good application in the corn states. And we're also seeing with, as I mentioned, globally, what's happening with the other large agricultural markets like India, Brazil, Argentina, devaluations, coupled with support and just good pull and good movement to China on the demand side for those products like corn and soybeans as well as protein, supports a nice global level. And that's why you've seen urea bounce all the way up to now in NOLA, $250 or even $255 has been done for August. So setting up, I believe, very nicely for the fall and then into 2021."

So it's certainly something that we are focused on and spending time on. As you know, we have a pretty deep relationship with Thyssenkrupp Uhde. They built our last 2 large expansion projects. I think they're one of the world leaders right now in the electrolysis. And so it is conversation and investigation, we're spending a lot of time on. And it would not surprise me to see us move into a situation where we have a full slate of offering at some point here in the near future with anything from conventional ammonia to blue ammonia to green ammonia. And some various combinations. But I think longer term, it's certainly the direction the world is moving and needs to move, and I think we are going to be a significant beneficiary of that because we're that -- we've already got all of the back end plus logistics and capability in place.

We expected 3 million to 4 million tons for this year, and we're trending lower than that through the first 7 months of the year. So their operating rates have been around, let's say, high 60s, low 70s percent, which we equate to about 53 million to 55 million tons of available supply. Domestic consumption seems to have been higher. Similar to India, incentivizing domestic production for supply of corn and rice and other -- obviously, fruits and vegetables are about 50% of their urea demand. But that has correlated well with internal demand and they're not pushing product out to the international market. I think when the market hit on a metric ton basis, $235, $240, we had expected more supply to come out of China. It did not. They've avoided the last 2 India tenders, just kind of on a perfunctory basis participated. And so looking at this tender that will open early next week, I would expect some additional tons, but those tons have now have been bid and sold in the $250, even up to $270 a ton FOB. So very supportive to the international market, very supportive trend for the remainder of the year, in which we believe will be probably fewer than last year export tons and at higher prices."

We're seeing that recover and seeing a good pull from our customers for that part of our business, which is a healthy percentage of our ammonia business. It's a 365/24/7 type business for us where the agricultural applications are really a few weeks in November and 1.5 months, maybe in April and May and into June. 
For the fertilizer side, we saw a nice recovery for ammonia. We've had some difficult application years in '18 and '19 due to whether it was cold, wet weather in the fall or cold weather in the spring, which delayed and moved some of that consumption to the upgraded products of UAN and urea. So we're pleased this year to see that and see our channel partners work with us on the custom application business. So feel good about where we are and what that or pushes forward for us is a healthy, lower inventory level going into the fall, and we expect to see, as I said earlier, a good fall application season."

That's above where we are today. So we're continuing to trade at a little bit of a discount to international parity, which is not really that uncommon given that when people need to find liquidity for cargoes, this is the place they come. That said, I think we're trading in a range that reflects actual underlying economics. And I think that's been shown the last couple of Indian tenders when you haven't seen huge participation coming out of China. And I think the world is operating very rationally, at least within the nitrogen industry today. As I said, we expect, given the absence of LNG cargoes, that once the surplus has kind of worked its way through the system, you'll see energy costs in Europe and Asia climb back up to an appropriate differential off of Henry Hub again. 
And so almost regardless of whether held prices move, what we really look at is that differential cost. And that differential becomes increasingly important during periods when China isn't exporting. And so we're very constructive about what the margin structure of this business looks like going forward, which we kind of indicated the next 6, 12, 18 months look pretty positive from our perspective. 
Yes, I agree. I think the nice -- I think where we are today and where we are -- I think we were projecting with the India tenders alone, taking the producer longs from North Africa and Arab Gulf into September, that kicks those positions forward, but you still have substantial buying, probably 0.5 million tons per month for Brazil through January and into February. Projections today are India will be over 10 million tons of consumption of imports, which is -- will be an all-time record. And so the rally, I believe, lasts for at this point into Q4. And then the United States has to start buying for its spring demand. And we are -- we believe the channel inventory in North America is fairly low coming out of our application season as well as production turnarounds that ours as well as others will have taken place. 
And so when you look at the cost curve, where anthracite coal is today on an MMBtu basis, that's about $6.50 to $7 on gas. And if they're able to export those numbers, those are -- that's very positive for the market because those tons are being bid in, and they need to make it all the way to the port, which are even additional cost. So a good floor right now for the market."

People have been, again, kind of very gloomy about the notion of new production start-ups and what that was going to portend for imports into India and a number of those plants,[ Thromble,] Matix and others have started up and similarly, older plants have shut down or curtailed substantially. So yes, while this year looks like it's a pretty strong year from the standpoint of application. A lot of it is just, I think, the recognition that it's more efficient from the standpoint of the general industry Indian economy to be importing urea as opposed to being trying to run older, high cost, inefficient facilities. So we're -- again, we're very constructive about the direction that this whole market is headed, [ burn ] in the other. 
It's exactly right. And with the level of imports, coupled with domestic production, be an all-time high for urea consumption. But you have to remember, we're going to approach, again, 50 million tons of kind of the export market. So this is a global rally. It's not just dependent on India. There are a number of countries that are consuming more. And we've seen a few shutdowns. So it's a balanced position to what's driving. And we seem to have something like these things happen every year or 2, a positive push to the market, and we're in the middle of one. 
I think to tack on to that, in the situation where you've got the huge global disruptions like the pandemic, the move towards food security is something that most governments really want to push toward and so optimal fertilization, trying to encourage complete growth is something that is top of mind, I think, for many regimes out there. So I think, again, underpinning the strong demand in nitrogen, we've actually been in an odd way, potentially somewhat beneficiaries of the whole situation."

Those were old, inefficient without good gas sources. The plant in now, close to Paranagu was actually supplied by a product from a refinery, which was next door. So they have been, I would say, not profitable for years. And I think through this whole rationalization process that Petrobras is going through, with their whole portfolio of assets and services, that was one area that just made sense. And there was an opportunity for another company to look and take those over and operate them, but that has not been able to happen probably due to gas supply. When you look at the available gas and gas pipeline network in Brazil compared to the United States or any western country or, let's say, European or North American opportunities, it's so small. And so -- and then the Bahia plant, for example, is just out of the market. They were trucking some of that urea all the way across the country, 1,000 miles to Mato Grosso did not make sense. So shutting them down was economically intelligent as well as operationally smart. What that has done is then increase the need for imports. And it's been very good for the international market, as we've talked about in India. So we talk about Brazil. Brazil will now be close to a 7 million-ton import market for urea. That puts the U.S. market as the third largest market, India being first, Brazil second and United States third for import demand. So very good growth for that international ton to move to."

So in terms of building new green ammonia plants, that's not high on my list of things that we want to do over the next 5 years or so. The economics around that are pretty challenged, I think. And let me describe a couple of different ways that we can, though, participate in all of this. The first one being we are actively investigating geological sequestration for the process CO2 gas that comes out that we capture, some of which we turn into ammonia, but you can -- we can go ahead and sequester that and then get offset as a result of that and certify some set of the production like even today, as blue ammonia, if we were going to do that. Similarly then, the next step would be, you could put in some electrolyzers and put in pre-hydrogen either into the back end of the process or potentially in the front end of the process. And buy renewable energy in a number of our locations, which is available, wind in Port Neal, Iowa, you got hydro in Courtright, Ontario. You've got some green options in the U.K. as well. And then from that, you can actually certify some of the production as green. And all of those things are relatively low capital cost implementations in order to be able to move a section of the portfolio from conventional to green and blue. I think to do a wholesale swap out, you're basically talking about replacing the front end steam methane reformers with huge electrolyzers, and that is a lot more capital economically today, that doesn't make sense because price of North American natural gas is so reasonable compared to other prices of energy, particularly if you're talking about renewable energy. However, a lot of that is dependent upon what the price of carbon is risen. And that the high enough carbon cost or a high enough product price demand for green ammonia, you could absolutely see the justification from an economic return for doing that. 
So my answer to that question is we're evaluating all of these different approaches. We haven't made any announcements yet because our belief is rather than a big fanfare of kind of smoke and mirrors and vaporware. We want to wait until we've got something real that we're doing and then announce something at that point in time. But we're evaluating all of this. And we think we've got a great path forward to actually, in the very near term, be able to produce some blue land or green ammonia. But not have it be a huge capital outlay in order to get there. I think longer term, though, if you project out to, let's just take the 2050 number that a lot of people are using you could absolutely see a number of our plants be full on green, running off of renewable fuel here. And I think the benefit that we have is the capital investment in terms of the back end of the process, along with all of the storage and shipping logistics and terminaling capabilities, is that we're in the best position to benefit from it and anything that drives demand for ammonia, whether it's green, blue or otherwise, is good for us because it just increases the price of ammonia globally. So certainly something we're excited about from a development standpoint."

You've seen high-cost producers shut down in Trinidad and actually in other parts of the world. And so -- and similarly, when you've had these new plants come online in India, you've had other plants, whether it's Brazil or India or other places in the world shutdown. So while there's tremendous microscopic attention paid to the specifics on supply demand, what ultimately happens in the situation is the market rationalizes how much supply is ultimately available because the high cost production shuts down and where that high-cost production is actually moves around a little bit because Trinidad was viewed as first or second quarter quartile assets for a long time up until just recently, and now they're the ones that are actually shutting down. And so what I would suggest is, while all of the time lines to build, have lengthened substantially and availability of some parts have been pushed out into the future, making it difficult for some people probably to operate.

So I think you're going to see some of these small disruptions. But as Tony mentioned, there's plenty of capacity, and it's just for that capacity to be bid back into production."

Last night, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $808 million. These results underscore the resilience of our business model and the outstanding performance of the CF team. In the midst of a difficult and uncertain environment, we maintained our focus on safe and reliable operations, worked closely with all of our partners to avoid disruptions due to the pandemic. And delivered company record first half sales volumes. These efforts exemplify our team's sustained operational excellence, which, along with our position on the low end of the global cost curve, drives our cash generation. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, we have produced more than 10 million tons of gross ammonia, sold roughly 20 million product tons and generated $973 million in free cash flow. 
Most importantly, we have done all of this safely. Our rolling recordable incident rate at the end of June was 0.31 incidents per 200,000 waiver hours, which is a new record low for the company. Protecting the health and well-being of our employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic remains our top focus. Our safety culture, along with the safety protocols we put in place, have kept a number of employees who have tested positive for the virus to a small number, and we have not experienced any known transmission within a CF location. We continue to have in place numerous precautionary measures across our network to protect our employees and those critical contractors who come into our facilities. In contrast to the uncertain challenges facing much of the broader economy, the nitrogen industry has performed well, driven by robust demand and low energy cost. 
And over the past few months, our outlook for the next 6 to 12 months has become both clear and much more positive. 
As you'll hear from Bert, strong demand in India and Brazil is supporting the global nitrogen market, with urea prices rising significantly in recent weeks. We are also more confident that 2021 corn planted in the U.S. will be within a normal range. 
Chinese anthracite based production remains the high cost marginal ton. And despite all the doom and gloom prognostication over the past 12 months, suggesting coal prices in China will fall, that hasn't happened. 
As you can see on Slide 13, the cost advantage per metric ton of urea remains robust for North American producers compared to the marginal production. Additionally, we expect that the cost curve which had flattened due to lower energy cost for many producers will steepen again going forward. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. LNG exports have declined significantly. 
As this works its way through the market, production costs for Europe and Asian producers should rise. As you can see on Slide 14, futures prices suggest a return to a more normal energy differentials in Europe and Asia. As this occurs, we expect margins for North American nitrogen production to increase compared to producers in these regions, which is particularly important during periods when China isn't exporting. Longer term, we expect to remain on the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost and abundant North American natural gas. That, combined with the fact that we operate in regions which are import dependent, should enable us to continue to generate substantial free cash flow in both the short and the long term. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation outlook. Before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,679030874,2064196,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 06, 2020",2020-08-06,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tony.

We had strong production, record sales volumes and navigated the uncertainty related to the pandemic extremely well. We had robust demand across all our products, this was supported both by higher planted corn acres than in 2019 and much more favorable planting conditions, which lengthened the application season. 
Early in the second quarter, we did see a pandemic-related decline in demand for industrial uses of our products. Strong agricultural demand and our production flexibility helped mitigate sales volume impacts. Since June, industrial demand appears to have moved closer to normal levels, especially for products such as diesel exhaust fluid. As industrial activity is closely tied to the economy, we will continue to watch this area closely and are prepared to adjust our production mix, again, if needed. Because of our heavy volumes during the first half, we ended the fertilizer year in June with very low inventories of all products. In July, we conducted our prepay and fall fill programs, all of which were in line with our expectations. We believe that those who participated will see a good return in the future given the rapidly changing and improving nitrogen dynamics in North America and around the world. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects 92 million acres of planted corn in the U.S. for 2020, 5 million more acres lower than its earlier forecast. This should alleviate concerns of a substantial oversupply scenario. At the same time, demand for corn globally has increased significantly led by purchases for China. Additionally, we have seen a good recovery in ethanol production and margins, supported by an increase in U.S. vehicle miles traveled. As a result, we believe planted acres in 2021 for the U.S. as well as total nitrogen used will be similar to the 10-year average. This improved North American outlook over a few months ago has been bolstered by positive demand driven developments globally. 
Current global nitrogen market sentiment is being driven by India and Brazil. Imports of urea into Brazil are up 13% through the first half of 2020, and we expect continued strong demand through the remainder of the year and into next year. In India, urea sales from April through July are up nearly 50% over 2019 due to favorable growing conditions, which could lead to a second straight year of record urea imports. Global urea prices have risen substantially with this demand as recent Indian urea tenders have secured lower-than-expected volumes. At the beginning of August, India issued its third urea tender in 22 days and at sixth since the end of March. We believe frequent urea tenders by India could continue through the end of the year. These positive demand developments have occurred alongside important though smaller supply developments. We have seen some high-cost ammonia production in Trinidad come off-line, we are also seeing profitable delays in the startup of new capacity due to the pandemic. So as we head into the second half of the year, we feel positive about industry dynamics and, in particular, about the demand outlook. 
As always, we are prepared to leverage our manufacturing and distribution network to meet any challenges and capture opportunities that arise. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first half of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $258 million or $1.20 per diluted share. EBITDA was $786 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $808 million. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs and higher sales volume. Natural gas continues to be a strong tailwind for the business. For the first half of the year, our cost of natural gas in the cost of sales was lower by nearly $1 per MMBtu and or about 30% than in the same period the year before. Management focus on strengthening our balance sheet and managing controllable costs responsibly also continues to support our results and financial flexibility. 
As we have said before, our fixed charges for 2020 are approximately $190 million lower on an annualized basis compared to 2017. Additionally, controllable cost per ton were lower in the first half of 2020 compared to the first half of 2019, even with the special bonus we provided to operational employees from March through June. This continues to support our cash generation on a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion, and free cash flow was $973 million. 
Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the first half were $563 million, and our $750 million revolver is undrawn. As we look ahead, our approach to allocating capital will continue to be balanced. This is especially important given the uncertainty in the broader economy. First, we'll continue to invest in our assets to support safe and reliable operations. As we noted in the press release, we expect capital expenditures to increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half because of increased scheduled maintenance and turnaround activity. These activities will also somewhat reduce gross ammonia production in the second half compared to the first half of 2020. We estimate that capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $350 million. Second, our focus in the near-term is building liquidity. And given the uncertainty in the broader environment, we expect to be above our target liquidity level in the near term. In line with this approach and similar to most companies, we did not repurchase shares in the second quarter in order to increase cash on the balance sheet. We believe this will give us the flexibility as a response to the pandemic. As conditions in the economy normalize, our approach will also give us additional capacity, along with our free cash flow generation to continue to create long-term shareholder value. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A."

We have an unparalleled manufacturing, distribution and logistics network that underpins our consistent operational performance.

So Joel, we're seeing it's pretty interesting because we've come off this year of 97 million, now it's 92 million acres of corn, a little bit weaker kind of grain and oilseed market. But amazingly, we had a fill program for ammonia, which is fairly small and then started building the book for the fall application season. As you remember, those tons sit in our inventory. So whether we sell them now or sell them in the fall. We're very comfortable with our ability to move those tons and get them into position, had to navigate a few river issues, river closures. But we feel very, very good about the ammonia season for the fall. Setting up, one with how the current crop is maturing and will come off and then have time for applications, both soybeans and corn. And then just the pricing structure. 
So what we think is a fair level for ammonia is out there and has been taken up. 
The next one is UAN, which is a bigger program. And we've had different size fill programs in the past from 1 month or 1.5 months’ worth of supply all the way up to maybe 4 -- let's say, 4 to 6 months. And this year was right in line with the average. We had good uptake. I think prices were very attractive, and I had those in my prepared remarks about the opportunities available to some of our channel partners. 
And so you've seen us be active in the export market. So again, a balanced approach to the market. And I think fall will kind of roll out in a good way. We're expecting in the 88 million to 90 million acres of corn for next year. So there'll be good application in the corn states. And we're also seeing with, as I mentioned, globally, what's happening with the other large agricultural markets like India, Brazil, Argentina, devaluations, coupled with support and just good pull and good movement to China on the demand side for those products like corn and soybeans as well as protein, supports a nice global level. And that's why you've seen urea bounce all the way up to now in NOLA, $250 or even $255 has been done for August. So setting up, I believe, very nicely for the fall and then into 2021."

So it's certainly something that we are focused on and spending time on. As you know, we have a pretty deep relationship with Thyssenkrupp Uhde. They built our last 2 large expansion projects. I think they're one of the world leaders right now in the electrolysis. And so it is conversation and investigation, we're spending a lot of time on. And it would not surprise me to see us move into a situation where we have a full slate of offering at some point here in the near future with anything from conventional ammonia to blue ammonia to green ammonia. And some various combinations. But I think longer term, it's certainly the direction the world is moving and needs to move, and I think we are going to be a significant beneficiary of that because we're that -- we've already got all of the back end plus logistics and capability in place.

We expected 3 million to 4 million tons for this year, and we're trending lower than that through the first 7 months of the year. So their operating rates have been around, let's say, high 60s, low 70s percent, which we equate to about 53 million to 55 million tons of available supply. Domestic consumption seems to have been higher. Similar to India, incentivizing domestic production for supply of corn and rice and other -- obviously, fruits and vegetables are about 50% of their urea demand. But that has correlated well with internal demand and they're not pushing product out to the international market. I think when the market hit on a metric ton basis, $235, $240, we had expected more supply to come out of China. It did not. They've avoided the last 2 India tenders, just kind of on a perfunctory basis participated. And so looking at this tender that will open early next week, I would expect some additional tons, but those tons have now have been bid and sold in the $250, even up to $270 a ton FOB. So very supportive to the international market, very supportive trend for the remainder of the year, in which we believe will be probably fewer than last year export tons and at higher prices."

And so we did see a dip in demand on the industrial side, due to COVID, some of that on the phosphate production, but just overall industrial capacity declining. We're seeing that recover and seeing a good pull from our customers for that part of our business, which is a healthy percentage of our ammonia business. It's a 365/24/7 type business for us where the agricultural applications are really a few weeks in November and 1.5 months, maybe in April and May and into June. 
For the fertilizer side, we saw a nice recovery for ammonia. We've had some difficult application years in '18 and '19 due to whether it was cold, wet weather in the fall or cold weather in the spring, which delayed and moved some of that consumption to the upgraded products of UAN and urea. So we're pleased this year to see that and see our channel partners work with us on the custom application business. So feel good about where we are and what that or pushes forward for us is a healthy, lower inventory level going into the fall, and we expect to see, as I said earlier, a good fall application season."

That's above where we are today. So we're continuing to trade at a little bit of a discount to international parity, which is not really that uncommon given that when people need to find liquidity for cargoes, this is the place they come. That said, I think we're trading in a range that reflects actual underlying economics. And I think that's been shown the last couple of Indian tenders when you haven't seen huge participation coming out of China. And I think the world is operating very rationally, at least within the nitrogen industry today. As I said, we expect, given the absence of LNG cargoes, that once the surplus has kind of worked its way through the system, you'll see energy costs in Europe and Asia climb back up to an appropriate differential off of Henry Hub again. 
And so almost regardless of whether held prices move, what we really look at is that differential cost. And that differential becomes increasingly important during periods when China isn't exporting. And so we're very constructive about what the margin structure of this business looks like going forward, which we kind of indicated the next 6, 12, 18 months look pretty positive from our perspective. 
Yes, I agree. I think the nice -- I think where we are today and where we are -- I think we were projecting with the India tenders alone, taking the producer longs from North Africa and Arab Gulf into September, that kicks those positions forward, but you still have substantial buying, probably 0.5 million tons per month for Brazil through January and into February. Projections today are India will be over 10 million tons of consumption of imports, which is -- will be an all-time record. And so the rally, I believe, lasts for at this point into Q4. And then the United States has to start buying for its spring demand. And we are -- we believe the channel inventory in North America is fairly low coming out of our application season as well as production turnarounds that ours as well as others will have taken place. 
And so when you look at the cost curve, where anthracite coal is today on an MMBtu basis, that's about $6.50 to $7 on gas. And if they're able to export those numbers, those are -- that's very positive for the market because those tons are being bid in, and they need to make it all the way to the port, which are even additional cost. So a good floor right now for the market."

People have been, again, kind of very gloomy about the notion of new production start-ups and what that was going to portend for imports into India and a number of those plants,[ Thromble,] Matix and others have started up and similarly, older plants have shut down or curtailed substantially. So yes, while this year looks like it's a pretty strong year from the standpoint of application. A lot of it is just, I think, the recognition that it's more efficient from the standpoint of the general industry Indian economy to be importing urea as opposed to being trying to run older, high cost, inefficient facilities. So we're -- again, we're very constructive about the direction that this whole market is headed, [ burn ] in the other. 
It's exactly right. And with the level of imports, coupled with domestic production, be an all-time high for urea consumption. But you have to remember, we're going to approach, again, 50 million tons of kind of the export market. So this is a global rally. It's not just dependent on India. There are a number of countries that are consuming more. And we've seen a few shutdowns. So it's a balanced position to what's driving. And we seem to have something like these things happen every year or 2, a positive push to the market, and we're in the middle of one. 
I think to tack on to that, in the situation where you've got the huge global disruptions like the pandemic, the move towards food security is something that most governments really want to push toward and so optimal fertilization, trying to encourage complete growth is something that is top of mind, I think, for many regimes out there. So I think, again, underpinning the strong demand in nitrogen, we've actually been in an odd way, potentially somewhat beneficiaries of the whole situation."

Those were old, inefficient without good gas sources. The plant in now, close to Paranagu was actually supplied by a product from a refinery, which was next door. So they have been, I would say, not profitable for years. And I think through this whole rationalization process that Petrobras is going through, with their whole portfolio of assets and services, that was one area that just made sense. And there was an opportunity for another company to look and take those over and operate them, but that has not been able to happen probably due to gas supply. When you look at the available gas and gas pipeline network in Brazil compared to the United States or any western country or, let's say, European or North American opportunities, it's so small. And so -- and then the Bahia plant, for example, is just out of the market. They were trucking some of that urea all the way across the country, 1,000 miles to Mato Grosso did not make sense. So shutting them down was economically intelligent as well as operationally smart. What that has done is then increase the need for imports. And it's been very good for the international market, as we've talked about in India. So we talk about Brazil. Brazil will now be close to a 7 million-ton import market for urea. That puts the U.S. market as the third largest market, India being first, Brazil second and United States third for import demand. So very good growth for that international ton to move to."

So in terms of building new green ammonia plants, that's not high on my list of things that we want to do over the next 5 years or so. The economics around that are pretty challenged, I think. And let me describe a couple of different ways that we can, though, participate in all of this. The first one being we are actively investigating geological sequestration for the process CO2 gas that comes out that we capture, some of which we turn into ammonia, but you can -- we can go ahead and sequester that and then get offset as a result of that and certify some set of the production like even today, as blue ammonia, if we were going to do that. Similarly then, the next step would be, you could put in some electrolyzers and put in pre-hydrogen either into the back end of the process or potentially in the front end of the process. And buy renewable energy in a number of our locations, which is available, wind in Port Neal, Iowa, you got hydro in Courtright, Ontario. You've got some green options in the U.K. as well. And then from that, you can actually certify some of the production as green. And all of those things are relatively low capital cost implementations in order to be able to move a section of the portfolio from conventional to green and blue. I think to do a wholesale swap out, you're basically talking about replacing the front end steam methane reformers with huge electrolyzers, and that is a lot more capital economically today, that doesn't make sense because price of North American natural gas is so reasonable compared to other prices of energy, particularly if you're talking about renewable energy. However, a lot of that is dependent upon what the price of carbon is risen. And that the high enough carbon cost or a high enough product price demand for green ammonia, you could absolutely see the justification from an economic return for doing that. 
So my answer to that question is we're evaluating all of these different approaches. We haven't made any announcements yet because our belief is rather than a big fanfare of kind of smoke and mirrors and vaporware. We want to wait until we've got something real that we're doing and then announce something at that point in time. But we're evaluating all of this. And we think we've got a great path forward to actually, in the very near term, be able to produce some blue land or green ammonia. But not have it be a huge capital outlay in order to get there. I think longer term, though, if you project out to, let's just take the 2050 number that a lot of people are using you could absolutely see a number of our plants be full on green, running off of renewable fuel here. And I think the benefit that we have is the capital investment in terms of the back end of the process, along with all of the storage and shipping logistics and terminaling capabilities, is that we're in the best position to benefit from it and anything that drives demand for ammonia, whether it's green, blue or otherwise, is good for us because it just increases the price of ammonia globally. So certainly something we're excited about from a development standpoint."

You've seen high-cost producers shut down in Trinidad and actually in other parts of the world. And so -- and similarly, when you've had these new plants come online in India, you've had other plants, whether it's Brazil or India or other places in the world shutdown. So while there's tremendous microscopic attention paid to the specifics on supply demand, what ultimately happens in the situation is the market rationalizes how much supply is ultimately available because the high cost production shuts down and where that high-cost production is actually moves around a little bit because Trinidad was viewed as first or second quarter quartile assets for a long time up until just recently, and now they're the ones that are actually shutting down. And so what I would suggest is, while all of the time lines to build, have lengthened substantially and availability of some parts have been pushed out into the future, making it difficult for some people probably to operate.

I think it's definitely more challenging and maybe extended longer, but I think that's the same challenges you have with just overall operational risk with whether a number of operators get the virus or not as well. So I think you're going to see some of these small disruptions. But as Tony mentioned, there's plenty of capacity, and it's just for that capacity to be bid back into production."

Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We feel good about our position as we near the end of the year. As we rev",615,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We feel good about our position as we near the end of the year. As we review our results on this call, I'd like to remind you that we evaluate our performance-based on half years and full years rather than a single quarter. This is because there can be significant shifts across quarters due to weather or other events. However, that spikiness tends to smooth out over time. So a longer time period provides a better picture of actual performance and focusing on an individual quarter. 
As of today, with 2 months to go when most of the fall ammonia season still ahead of us, we continue to expect that our full year 2020 results will end up within plus or minus a few percentage points of our 2018 performance for adjusted EBITDA. Our outlook hasn't changed since back in February, when we first gave our expectations for the full year. 
Overall, the CF team continues to execute exceptionally well. Asset utilization remains high, and our sales volumes through 9 months are a new company record. We also continue to efficiently convert EBITDA into free cash. Most importantly, we are operating safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of September was 0.17 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, which is a new company record and substantially better than industry benchmarks. This is a tremendous accomplishment, and we're extraordinarily proud of our team's unwavering focus on safety, particularly in the face of the pandemic. Speaking of which, our pandemic related precautionary measures have been working well, and we have not had a single known transmission of the COVID-19 virus within any of our locations. With these precautions in place, we were able to complete safely critical turnaround activity at several locations during the quarter. 
As we look toward next year, the company is well positioned for the opportunities ahead. As Bert will describe in a few moments, we expect solid global demand and widening energy spreads, which will create greater price realization opportunities during '21 compared to this year. Given our position at the low end of the global cost curve, we believe these dynamics will support continued strong free cash flow generation. We are very excited about our announcement last week and our commitment to the clean energy economy, which provides a real growth platform for the company. As we discussed, hydrogen has emerged as a lean clean energy source to help the world achieve net 0 carbon emissions, and ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen. Because CF is the world's largest producer of ammonia, we are uniquely positioned with our unparalleled asset base and technical knowledge to serve this developing demand. 
As we decarbonize our network and aggressively scale our ability to produce green and low-carbon ammonia, we believe we will be able to realize the clean fuel value for ammonia rather than its nutrient value. In doing so, we expect to realize a substantial premium compared to the value of ammonia as a fertilizer or a feedstock. 
Last Thursday, we announced our first steps in seizing this growth opportunity with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville as the centerpiece of initial investments. We look forward to sharing our progress and our follow-on steps in the months ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position of capital allocation, before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"
22357184,689255591,2130409,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Yes, Tony.

Year-to-date, the global nitrogen market has been incredibly resilient in light of the pandemic. Demand for agricultural applications has grown in 2020, and industrial demand continues to recover from the disruptions in April and May. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect solid global demand led by North America, India and Brazil. We also project improving price dynamics as the global cost curve steepens with rising energy prices, and wider energy spreads compared to North America. 
As we noted in the press release, we are projecting a healthy level of corn planting as well as increases in wheat and canola plantings in North America, supporting good demand in the region. We are forecasting approximately 90 million planted corn acres in the United States in 2021. This is in line with the levels of the last 10 years and supported by improved farm economics due to higher corn futures, government payments, and lower input prices. If weather conditions allow, we would expect to have a strong fall ammonia season due to the farm economics, I just described, and the attractiveness of ammonia prices today compared to the other nitrogen products. 
We expect that industrial demand will continue to recover in line with economic activity. We believe industrial demand for ammonia has been mostly tied to the state of the economy due to the pandemic. In contrast, demand for feed grade urea and diesel exhaust fluid has been relatively resilient. Our year-to-date DES sales volumes were up 6% compared to 2019, which would have been difficult to foresee in April when economic activity and miles driven declined so dramatically. 
Outside of North America, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil. We believe India is likely to exceed 9 million metric tons of urea imports through tenders in 2020. We also expect demand for urea imports into Brazil of approximately 6.5 million metric tons will continue to be supported by improved pharma incomes and no active domestic urea production. 
As we look at our cost curve projection for the next year, on Slide 12, we see opportunities for greater price realizations during 2021 compared to this year. In 2020, the convergence of global natural gas prices in the first half led to a largely flat global cost curve. Formally, high-cost producers pursued this temporary margin opportunity available to them, increasing operating rates and pressuring product prices. In recent months, energy prices have risen across the globe, but at a much higher rate in Europe and Asia than in North America. These higher gas costs and the steeper global cost curve that results increases opportunities for low cost producers, like CF, to achieve greater price realizations. Indeed, some of our most profitable years has been when our own natural gas costs were higher, but energy spreads were wider. We are well prepared as the nitrogen market dynamics adjust over the coming year and the direction of the global response to the pandemic becomes clearer. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."
22357184,689255591,2130409,"CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bert. For the first 9 months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share.

For the first 9 months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share. EBITDA was $982 million and adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion. For the third quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $28 million or $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $196 million and adjusted EBITDA was $204 million. 
As you know, the third quarter typically has our lowest realized prices, lowest volumes and highest level of maintenance and turnaround activity. This quarter was no different. However, both our year-to-date and quarterly results reflect the same overall factors. Lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices, partially offset by lower natural gas and SG&A costs. On a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $756 million. At the end of October, cash on the balance sheet was well over $600 million, and we are well positioned to fulfill our commitment to repay the remaining $250 million on our 2021 notes. 
We expect capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million, as we maintain our high standards of reliability and safety. As we noted in the press release, this is lower than our initial estimate, due largely to the deferral of nonessential activity as a result of the pandemic. We expect our capital budget will return to our typical $400 million to $450 million range in 2021 and beyond. Each year, our capital CapEx budget includes not only turnarounds and other sustaining activities, but also investments in improvement projects that allow us to pursue strategic opportunities. Recent examples from this category include the nitric acid expansion project announced this year, and the diesel exhaust fluid unit completed in 2017, both at our Donaldsonville facility. The green ammonia project at Donaldsonville will fit into this improvement portion of our capital expenditure budget over the next 3 years, which allows us to maintain our overall CapEx at normal levels. That said, we expect that additional steps we will take to enable the production of green and low carbon pneumonia will require investment beyond this $400 million to $450 million annual range. We are excited to invest in the growth of the company given the expected profile -- expected return profile. And we see a lot of opportunities ahead to do just that. So after the repayment of the $250 million in 2021 notes, we would expect that our primary use of cash in the coming years will be in support of our strategic focus on clean hydrogen and ammonia projects. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

But as you said, initially, I think the first sources of demand that we're seeing right now are really coming from some of the Japanese utility providers. As you know, in the wake of the terrible tragedy at Fukushima, the nuclear fleet was decommissioned in Japan and that necessitated movement back to coal-based electricity production. Obviously, that's going the wrong direction from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective. And so they are very focused and moving aggressively toward alternative clean sources of energy to help offset the coal-based production of electricity, and injecting ammonia is one of those ways that they're going to improve their footprint from a country perspective. But we see a number of other applications that are rapidly developing as well, including marine transport, where ammonia can be used directly as a fuel as well as disassociated into hydrogen to be used as a fuel. And there's a number of other off-road and industrial applications that are being pretty rapidly explored along with vehicle traffic. And so our view is that this is actually going to hit a tipping point pretty soon and the mortar -- infrastructure that gets developed, the faster that will happen, and then you'll see really rapid evolution. But obviously, that can't occur until you start developing the supply base. And so we're on the front edge of this to be able to develop the supply base and help facilitate the -- really getting to the infrastructure and the tipping point faster. So we're really excited about this opportunity. I think it's the only way the world is going to make a dramatic dent in the overall greenhouse gas emissions profile, and we're excited to be leading the efforts. Bert, Chris?"

Obviously, per the previous question, that Bert talked about, with the UAN rebalancing, there's still some downward pressure on UAN as well. But I think in response, what you've seen is some of the higher cost producers or production facilities globally have actually curtailed or shut down. There's been at least 3 significant plants in Trinidad that have curtailed for an extended period of time. And the benefit that we see going forward is as you see energy spreads expand between North America and Europe and Asia, in particular, even if the overall energy complex is going up, it's the spread that actually matters a lot because that will push the kind of high-cost second-tier or second quartile, third quartile, people into the fourth and dramatically pressure margins to the point that during parts of the year where it was pretty sloppy this year from excess supply, you won't see that excess supply next year. And that's why we think there'll be pretty significant improvement opportunities in terms of pricing.

And again, those are -- goes to the issues that I just mentioned for the last caller. But what is -- where we are today and the most recent India tender in the $270 a metric ton delivered, it's a China story. And China's operating rates today are around 55 million tons of supply with 4 million to 5 million tons exported. And what is that price level with the RMB, at currently 6.7, and coal costs where they are, the marginal producer is going to be pressured and probably will not be participating in the international tenders. That, coupled with increasing Chinese demand for urea and crop production as well as production of NPKs, we don't see China being as big of a force, probably post November, in the international market. Again, coupled with good demand globally, where we see the key markets driving and Europe yet to buy, we see healthy demand going into spring, that should tighten up the market. We're at, I think, through September, 600,000 tons of imports into the United States. That's probably below where it should be. And so at some point, we need to start catching up and bidding in those tons from either North Africa or the Middle East or Russia. And so that should drive pricing as we get closer to spring. And again, corn plantings could be higher than what we're projecting with $4 corn position out there today."

I think rising energy costs in North America is actually a good thing for us because what that means is the LNG cargoes, from a replacement economic perspective, starts becoming incrementally more expensive. And that's really what's going to end up driving the energy price differentials or that spread. What happened this last year was in the -- as Bert talked about in the aftermath of the economic slowdown driven by COVID, you had very cheap natural gas cost in the U.S., and you had a lot of excess cargoes of LNG floating around it, for which there was really no home, and that led to a massive oversupply, and the result of that was extraordinarily low-cost gas into Europe. There was a big chunk of the year we were paying less for natural gas in our U.K. facilities than we were in North America, and that's completely upside down from normal. So that led to the abnormally high operating rates in the rest of the world and excess supply, which capped pricing for nitrogen. And I think in a rising price for natural gas environment where the demand is really trying to kind of spur back on again, we'd expect there to be, given the reduction in LNG exports, a return to normal differentials, and that provides a much better price environment even if our cost structure is higher. I think Bert mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but some of our best years from the standpoint of profitability actually were with a relatively higher natural gas cost in North America compared to a real low cost. And so we think that this actually portends well for us looking forward."

And now all of those assets are running at extraordinarily high utilization rates and on stream factor. I don't know that there's another set of assets out there that are close to ours. So one of the embedded costs of M&A is you have to first start off with assets that are probably not as well maintained and get them up to our standard before then you make additional investments on top to convert into low carbon and green ammonia.

But in general, if you're a grower, you need a certain amount of nitrogen load. And if you're able to apply some of that in the fall, that requires less nitrogen in the spring. But we really like ammonia going down, whether it's in the fall or the spring, because we have a differential asset base that allows us to realize terrific values for ammonia. And if you end up with poor ammonia application, then we end up having to export ammonia and the price realization for that tends to be lower. And in general, we sell everything that we make and we run our plants full on. And so the benefit that we have is, given that North America is an import region that we're not really worried about are you ""cannibalizing"" sales out of next year to be able to move from this year? We run our plants at capacity. We sell everything that we make over the course of a year. And so we either get it in the fall or we get it in spring, but basically it's the same number of tons ultimately that go down. And there is this sort of love-hate relationship we have with ammonia. On the one hand, again, we've got this differential asset base that allows us to exploit and realize terrific values. But on the other side, the less anhydrous ammonia that goes down means the more upgraded product that goes down, and basically, you're putting on 2 tons of urea for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down or about 3 tons of UAN for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down. And the margins on a per unit of nitrogen basis tend to be better on upgraded products. So in a strong ammonia market, we're going to do really well because we get great value. In an ammonia market that doesn't move a lot, we're going to do really well because of the volume of upgraded products that we make. So it's a really good kind of natural hedge position that we have based on our product mix. Bert, do you want to?"

You also have to remember with Precision Ag, the impact of fall ammonia is less than it was 20 years ago, where you're actually probably applying less on that one pass-through and doing multiple applications, whether that be some ammonia in fall or spring, and then urea or UAN on top. And so the impact of a negative fall is less. And again, what Tony said, our ability to to manage through it is pretty solid."

And so potentially, in that environment, if you're using lower carbon inputs, you can get even additional benefits associated with in-soil sequestration. And so I think that's a possibility. I'd say, right now, that doesn't really exist. But particularly if we end up projecting forward around a set of carbon regs and legislation that may be developing here, I could imagine that, that might be something pretty attractive.

We think that demand will be stable to increasing. But looking at where the market is overall, there hasn't been a lot of new capacity coming in. You've had Akron, a producer in Russia, drop a urea plant in to decrease their production in that market. You've had growing demand in Argentina and Brazil, which has helped support the market. And then you've seen some of the moves that we have made with DEF and nitric acid to take that existing stream into further higher-valued products. And so as we have repatriated our tons from Europe, we have not fully pushed those into the market. And that is how the market, at this point, has been balanced. But we see some very good opportunities for end market plans, and continue to value UAN as a key, if not ducky, product of the company."

And this year, as you saw, we're at much the low end of the range for the cost curve. And that is really predominantly because we are right on top of each other from a differential.

And so I think that fundamentally gets to the issue of the U.K. being very serious about trying to reduce aggregate emissions and from agriculture as well, relative to our North American production base, that's a little bit challenging. But in the U.K., we make ammonium nitrate, which is the -- really the fertilizer of choice in the U.K. given the soil conditions and the climate and the crops that are grown over there. And so reducing a substitute from -- away from our business is actually very helpful over there. But I think we're prepared to support the U.K. farmers regardless of which direction they end up going. But I think, again, it just speaks to how serious certain countries have gotten around carbon reduction, and we're excited about some opportunities that exist in the U.K. for us to be able to produce green and low carbon ammonia over there as well.

Because to the extent you take what is currently the most ubiquitous form of nitrogen fertilizer and globally traded and start reducing demand, you've got to substitute other forms of nitrogen for it. And that then starts putting incremental demand with a relatively captive supply that doesn't expand readily. And so you ultimately are driving up price of nutrients to the farmer, that's going to work its way through the supply chain into the price of food on the grocery store shelf. And that's a question then that governments are going to have to wrestle with. I think it's probably easier to be managed at in some more affluent areas of the world than it is in others. But I guess we'll see how it develops. The good news is because we're moving early on decarbonizing our network, we'll be in a position that whether it's ammonia, whether it's low carbon, whether it's AN, that's low carbon, whether it's a different form, we'll be in a position to be able to supply whatever is needed, both for an energy source and a nutrient content.

When you've gone from, let's say, in 2000, 16 million tons of fertilizer demand to probably 38 million tons this year and probably heading towards 50 million tons in not-too-distant future. It's been a steadily increasing demand. I think 1 of the issues that we're dealing with, with Tony's comments climactically relate directly to Brazil and opening new acres and what -- where they're opening those acres and how they're opening those acres. And Bolsonaro has been pretty aggressive of opening up the outer reaches of the Savannah. And so that's been controversial globally. But there is a substantial land available that's to cattle feeding today, grass fed, that could be opened up with not too much difficulty in or even and some of the outer reaches a very of Bahia. And so the opportunity in Brazil is there. They're taking advantage of it with the devaluation of the currency that we experienced this year down to, let's say, 5.70 to the dollar, that's super attractive for the Brazilian producer. And what have they done? They've done exactly as they economically should, which is increase areas, increase yields through further fertilization and the sophistication of the Brazilian farmer is on an equal basis with the American farmer on equipment, on technology, on the things that are happening. So we're fairly bullish what can happen using urea grow from 2 million tons 20 years ago of imports to 6.5 million tons this year. And guess what? You've seen a consumentenclaim yield. They have further yield to go in corn, especially. The late planting was more related to dryness than it was anything else. So I think you're going to see -- you may see a yield impact, again, due to that dry weather pattern that has hovered there, and then the late plantings. We'll see what happens with, which is the second crop corn that gets planted because of soybeans implanted late. That means the second crop form will be planted late. So more to come. We're constructive. We're participating in the Brazilian market and like to see what's happening down there."

Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We feel good about our position as we near the end of the year. As we rev",614,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first 9 months of 2020, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of just over $1 billion. We feel good about our position as we near the end of the year. As we review our results on this call, I'd like to remind you that we evaluate our performance based on half years and full years rather than a single quarter. This is because there can be significant shifts across quarters due to weather or other events. However, that spikiness tends to smooth out over time so a longer time period provides a better picture of actual performance than focusing on an individual quarter. 
As of today, with 2 months to go and most of the fall ammonia season still ahead of us, we continue to expect that our full year 2020 results will end up within plus or minus a few percentage points of our 2018 performance for adjusted EBITDA. Our outlook hasn't changed since back in February when we first gave our expectations for the full year. 
Overall, the CF team continues to execute exceptionally well. Asset utilization remains high, and our sales volumes through 9 months are new company record. We also continue to efficiently convert EBITDA into free cash. Most importantly, we are operating safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of September was 0.17 incidents per 200,000 labor hours, which is a new company record and substantially better than industry benchmarks. This is a tremendous accomplishment, and we're extraordinarily proud of our team's unwavering focus on safety, particularly in the face of the pandemic. Speaking of which, our pandemic-related precautionary measures have been working well, and we have not had a single known transmission of the COVID-19 virus within any of our locations. With these precautions in place, we were able to complete safely critical turnaround activity at several locations during the quarter. 
As we look toward next year, the company is well positioned for the opportunities ahead. As Bert will describe in a few moments, we expect solid global demand and widening energy spreads, which will create greater price realization opportunities during '21 compared to this year. Given our position at the low end of the global cost curve, we believe these dynamics will support continued strong free cash flow generation. 
We are very excited about our announcement last week and our commitment to the clean energy economy, which provides a real growth platform for the company. As we discussed, hydrogen has emerged as a leading clean energy source to help the world achieve net 0 carbon emissions, and ammonia is one of the most efficient ways to transport and store hydrogen. Because CF is the world's largest producer of ammonia, we are uniquely positioned with our unparalleled asset base and technical knowledge to serve this developing demand. 
As we decarbonize our network and aggressively scale our ability to produce green and low-carbon ammonia, we believe we will be able to realize the clean fuel value for ammonia rather than its nutrient value. In doing so, we expect to realize a substantial premium compared to the value of ammonia as a fertilizer or a feedstock. Last Thursday, we announced our first steps in seizing this growth opportunity with the green ammonia project at Donaldsonville as the centerpiece of initial investments. We look forward to sharing our progress and our follow-on steps in the months ahead. 
With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will discuss the global nitrogen market. Then Chris will follow to talk about our financial position and capital allocation before I return for some closing comments. Bert?"

Year-to-date, the global nitrogen market has been incredibly resilient in light of the pandemic. Demand for agricultural applications has grown in 2020, and industrial demand continues to recover from the disruptions in April and May. Lookin",506,"Thanks, Tony. Year-to-date, the global nitrogen market has been incredibly resilient in light of the pandemic. Demand for agricultural applications has grown in 2020, and industrial demand continues to recover from the disruptions in April and May. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect solid global demand led by North America, India and Brazil. We also project improving price dynamics as the global cost curve steepens with rising energy prices and wider energy spreads compared to North America. 
As we noted in the press release, we are projecting a healthy level of corn planting as well as increases in wheat and canola plantings in North America, supporting good demand in the region. We are forecasting approximately 90 million planted corn acres in the United States in 2021. This is in line with the levels of the last 10 years and supported by improved farm economics due to higher corn futures, government payments and lower input prices. If weather conditions allow, we would expect to have a strong fall ammonia season due to the farm economics I just described and the attractiveness of ammonia prices today compared to the other nitrogen products. 
We expect that industrial demand will continue to recover in line with economic activity. We believe industrial demand for ammonia has been mostly tied to the state of the economy due to the pandemic. In contrast, demand for feed-grade urea and diesel exhaust fluid has been relatively resilient. Our year-to-date DEF sales volumes are up 6% compared to 2019, which would have been difficult to foresee in April when economic activity and miles driven declined so dramatically. 
Outside of North America, we continue to expect positive demand in most growing regions, particularly India and Brazil. We believe India is likely to exceed 9 million metric tons of urea imports through tenders in 2020. We also expect demand for urea imports into Brazil of approximately 6.5 million metric tons will continue to be supported by improved farm incomes and no active domestic urea production. 
As we look at our cost curve projection for the next year on Slide 12, we see opportunities for greater price realizations during 2021 compared to this year. In 2020, the convergence of global natural gas prices in the first half led to a largely flat global cost curve. Formally, high-cost producers pursued this temporary margin opportunity available to them, increasing operating rates and pressuring product prices. 
In recent months, energy prices have risen across the globe but at a much higher rate in Europe and Asia than in North America. These higher gas costs and the steeper global cost curve that results increases opportunities for low-cost producers like CF to achieve greater price realizations. Indeed, some of our most profitable years has been when our own natural gas costs were higher but energy spreads were wider. We are well prepared as the nitrogen market dynamics adjust over the coming year and the direction of the global response to the pandemic becomes clearer. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Chris."

For the first 9 months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share.

For the first 9 months of 2020, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $230 million or $1.07 per diluted share. EBITDA was $982 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $1 billion. For the third quarter of 2020, we reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $28 million or $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $196 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $204 million. 
As you know, the third quarter typically has our lowest realized prices, lowest volumes and highest level of maintenance and turnaround activity. This quarter was no different. However, both our year-to-date and quarterly results reflect the same overall factors: lower year-over-year global nitrogen prices partially offset by lower natural gas and SG&A costs. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $756 million. At the end of October, cash on the balance sheet was well over $600 million, and we are well positioned to fulfill our commitment to repay the remaining $250 million on our 2021 notes. 
We expect capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million as we maintain our high standards of reliability and safety. As we noted in the press release, this is lower than our initial estimate due largely to the deferral of nonessential activity as a result of the pandemic. We expect our capital budget will return to our typical $400 million to $450 million range in 2021 and beyond. Each year, our capital -- CapEx budget includes not only turnarounds and other sustaining activities, but also investments in improvement projects that allow us to pursue strategic opportunities. Recent examples from this lighter include the nitric acid expansion project announced this year and the diesel exhaust fluid unit completed in 2017, both at our Donaldsonville facility. The green ammonia project at Donaldsonville will fit into this improvement portion of our capital expenditure budget over the next 3 years, which allows us to maintain our overall CapEx at normal levels. 
That said, we expect that additional steps we will take to enable the production of green and low-carbon ammonia will require investment beyond this $400 million to $450 million annual range. We are excited to invest in the growth of the company given the expected profile -- expected return profile, and we see a lot of opportunities ahead to do just that. So after the repayment of the $250 million in 2021 notes, we would expect that our primary use of cash in the coming years will be in support of our strategic focus on clean hydrogen and ammonia projects. 
With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A."

Our team continues to demonstrate their focus, operational excellence and the strength of our business during the most unusual of years. I also want to recognize the winner of our annual Wilson Award for Excellence in Safety. This year's winner is our Courtright Nitrogen Facility in Ontario for their deployment of wireless technology to better predict and prevent equipment failures. This award is a great reflection of our safety culture at work, and I encourage everyone to view the impressive ideas from this year's finalists, which can be found on our website. 
As the world focuses on decarbonization, hydrogen will be a key clean energy source, and ammonia is a critical enabler for the storage and transport of hydrogen. CF Industries is the world's largest producer of ammonia, and we will leverage our significant competitive advantages, which include the strength of our team, our operational excellence, technical knowledge and unparalleled asset base, advantages that will enable us to deliver green and low-carbon ammonia at scale years faster and billions of dollars less capital-intensive than many others looking at this opportunity. This will propel us to the forefront of hydrogen supply, being a leader in producing clean fuels for a sustainable world and providing a growth platform to create shareholder value. 
With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions."

I'll handle this, and then I'll also ask Bert and Chris to chime in as we go here. But as you said, initially, I think the first sources of demand that we're seeing right now are really coming from some of the Japanese utility providers. As you know, in the wake of the terrible tragedy at Fukushima, the nuclear fleet was decommissioned in Japan, and that necessitated a movement back to coal-based electricity production. Obviously, that's going the wrong direction from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective. And so they are very focused and moving aggressively toward alternative clean sources of energy to help offset the coal-based production of electricity, and injecting ammonia is one of those ways that they're going to improve their footprint from a country perspective. 
But we see a number of other applications that are rapidly developing as well, including marine transport, where ammonia can be used directly as a fuel as well as disassociated into hydrogen to be used as a fuel. And there's a number of other off-road and industrial applications that are being pretty rapidly explored along with vehicle traffic. And so our view is that this is actually going to hit a tipping point pretty soon. And the more infrastructure that gets developed, the faster that will happen, and then you'll see really rapid evolution. But obviously, that can't occur until you start developing the supply base. And so we're on the front edge of this to be able to develop the supply base and help facilitate the -- really getting to the infrastructure and the tipping point faster. So we're really excited about this opportunity. I think it's the only way the world is going to make a dramatic dent in the overall greenhouse gas emissions profile, and we're excited to be leading the efforts. Bert, Chris?"

So that's particularly in ammonia and urea. Obviously, per the previous question that Bert talked about, with the UAN rebalancing, there's still some downward pressure on UAN as well. 
But I think in response, what you've seen is some of the higher-cost producers or production facilities globally have actually curtailed or shut down. There's been at least 3 significant plants in Trinidad that have curtailed for an extended period of time. And the benefit that we see going forward is as you see energy spreads expand between North America and Europe and Asia in particular, even if the overall energy complex is going up, it's the spread that actually matters a lot because that will push the kind of high-cost second-tier -- or second quartile, third quartile people into the fourth and dramatically pressure margins to the point that during parts of the year where it was pretty sloppy this year from excess supply, you won't see that excess supply next year. And that's why we think there'll be pretty significant improvement opportunities in terms of pricing.

The energy issue is the probably the cost side where we fell to as low as $1.50 in North America, but also equally cheap in Europe and the U.K., which brought on their continued high-cost capacity to operate.

So a substantial fall or a decrease in pricing and then some inventory carryover. And so you just had an imbalance and then a perception of where value lied and what type of risk would be taken on by either the retail or wholesaler group. 
And the 1 positive -- or 2 positives that have really pushed the market back into a normal operating rate have been India and Brazil.

But what is -- where we are today and the most recent India tender in the $270 a metric ton delivered, it's a China story. And China's operating rates today are around 55 million tons of supply with 4 million to 5 million tons exported. And what is that price level with the RMB, at currently RMB 6.7, and coal costs where they are, the marginal producer is going to be pressured and probably will not be participating in the international tenders. That, coupled with increasing Chinese demand for urea and crop production as well as production of NPKs, we don't see China being as big of a force probably post-November in the international market. Again, coupled with good demand globally, where we see the key markets driving and Europe yet to buy, we see healthy demand going into spring that should tighten up the market. We're at, I think, through September, 600,000 tons of imports into the United States. That's probably below where it should be. And so at some point, we need to start catching up and bidding in those tons from either North Africa or the Middle East or Russia, and so that should drive pricing as we get closer to spring. And again, corn plantings could be higher than what we're projecting with a $4 corn position out there today."

I think rising energy costs in North America is actually a good thing for us because what that means is the LNG cargoes, from a replacement economic perspective, starts becoming incrementally more expensive. And that's really what's going to end up driving the energy price differentials or that spread. What happened this last year was in the -- as Bert talked about in the aftermath of the economic slowdown driven by COVID, you had very cheap natural gas cost in the U.S., and you had a lot of excess cargoes of LNG floating around it, for which there was really no home. And that led to a massive oversupply, and the result of that was extraordinarily low-cost gas into Europe. There was a big chunk of the year we were paying less for natural gas in our U.K. facilities than we were in North America, and that's completely upside down from normal. So that led to the abnormally high operating rates in the rest of the world and excess supply, which capped pricing for nitrogen. 
And I think in a rising price for natural gas environment where the demand is really trying to kind of spur back on again, we'd expect there to be, given the reduction in LNG exports, a return to normal differentials, and that provides a much better price environment even if our cost structure is higher. I think Bert mentioned this in his prepared remarks, but some of our best years from the standpoint of profitability actually were with a relatively higher natural gas cost in North America compared to a real low cost. And so we think that this actually portends well for us looking forward."

And as you know, we put a bunch of money into the old Terra assets when we finished up that acquisition, and now all of those assets are running at extraordinarily high utilization rates and on-stream factor. I don't know that there's another set of assets out there that are close to ours. 
So one of the embedded costs of M&A is you have to first start off with assets that are probably not as well maintained and get them up to our standard before then you make additional investments on top to convert into low carbon and green ammonia. So while it's certainly a possibility, and again it comes down to price value, I really like our asset base, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to reinvest in it."

But in general, if you're a grower, you need a certain amount of nitrogen load. And if you're able to apply some of that in the fall, that requires less nitrogen in the spring. But we really like ammonia going down, whether it's in the fall or the spring, because we have a differential asset base that allows us to realize terrific values for ammonia. And if you end up with poor ammonia application, then we end up having to export ammonia, and the price realization for that tends to be lower. 
And in general, we sell everything that we make and we run our plants full on. And so the benefit that we have is given that North America is an import region, that we're not really worried about are you ""cannibalizing"" sales out of next year to be able to move from this year? We run our plants at capacity. We sell everything that we make over the course of a year. And so we either get it in the fall or we get it in spring, but basically, it's the same number of tons ultimately that go down. 
And there is this sort of love-hate relationship we have with ammonia. On the one hand, again, we've got this differential asset base that allows us to exploit and realize terrific values. But on the other side, the less anhydrous ammonia that goes down means the more upgraded product that goes down. And basically, you're putting on 2 tons of urea for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down or about 3 tons of UAN for every ton of ammonia that didn't go down. And the margins on a per unit of nitrogen basis tend to be better on upgraded products. So in a strong ammonia market, we're going to do really well because we get great value. In an ammonia market that doesn't move a lot, we're going to do really well because of the volume of upgraded products that we make.

You also have to remember, with precision ag, the impact of fall ammonia is less than it was 20 years ago, where you're actually probably applying less on that one pass-through and doing multiple applications, whether that be some ammonia in fall or spring and then urea or UAN on top.

But every time you move over to either a new complex or a new plant within the same complex, there's going to be some baseline that you're starting from. However, we would expect on our second and third, once these -- that we'll end up with a lot of learnings and some efficiencies and improvements.

And so there -- if that's the list, there is not a great list of capacity coming on, coupled with where we see growth and economic recovery on the industrial side for -- and being what we've already articulated. So we see a tightening market. 
And what we've seen in Trinidad with 1 million tons of ammonia coming off and a rising energy market where we're now at -- in looking at the JKM gas market close to $7 and NBP in Europe and the U.K. over $5, $5.50, that's a good spread, and that does make higher-cost producers at current pricing for ammonia uneconomic.

And you should see lower operating rates by some of those mid-tier, call it, sort of third and fourth quartile players. And this year, as you saw, we're at much the low end of the range for the cost curve, and that is really predominantly because we are right on top of each other from a differential. As Tony mentioned, we are paying less in the U.K. than we were here in the U.S. So I think what 2021 is going to provide us is not only higher end of the cost curve, but also during particular times of the year, more pricing opportunity than what we've seen specifically this year."

And so I think that fundamentally gets to the issue of the U.K. being very serious about trying to reduce aggregate emissions and -- from agriculture as well. Relative to our North American production base, that's a little bit challenging. But in the U.K., we make ammonium nitrate, which is the -- really the fertilizer of choice in the U.K. given the soil conditions and the climate and the crops that are grown over there. And so reducing a substitute from -- away from our AN business is actually very helpful over there. But I think we're prepared to support the U.K. farmers regardless of which direction they end up going. But I think, again, it just speaks to how serious certain countries have gotten around carbon reduction, and we're excited about some opportunities that exist in the U.K. for us to be able to produce green and low-carbon ammonia over there as well.

Because to the extent you take what is currently the most ubiquitous form of nitrogen fertilizer globally traded and start reducing demand, you've got to substitute other forms of nitrogen for it. And that then starts putting incremental demand with a relatively captive supply that doesn't expand readily. And so you ultimately are driving up price of nutrients to the farmer that's going to work its way through the supply chain into the price of food on the grocery store shelf. And that's a question then that governments are going to have to wrestle with. I think it's probably easier to be managed at -- in some more affluent areas of the world than it is in others but, I guess, we'll see how it develops. 
The good news is because we're moving early on decarbonizing our network, we'll be in a position that whether it's ammonia that's low carbon, whether it's AN that's low carbon, whether it's a different form, we'll be in a position to be able to supply whatever is needed, both at -- for an energy source and a nutrient content.

It's been a steadily increasing demand. I think one of the issues that we're dealing with, with Tony's comments, climactically relate directly to Brazil and opening new acres and what -- where they're opening those acres and how they're opening those acres. And Bolsonaro has been pretty aggressive of opening up the outer reaches of the savanna and so that's been controversial globally. But there is a substantial land available that's -- to cattle feeding today, grass-fed, that could be opened up with not too much difficulty in Mato Grosso do Sul or even Goias and some of the outer reaches of area of Bahia. And so the opportunity in Brazil is there. They're taking advantage of it with the devaluation of the currency that we experienced this year down to, let's say, BRL 5.70 to the dollar. That's been super attractive for the Brazilian producer. And what have they done? They've done exactly as they economically should, which is increase areas, increase yields through further fertilization. And the sophistication of the Brazilian farmer is on an equal basis with the American farmer on equipment, on technology, on the things that are happening. So we're fairly bullish what can happen. You've seen urea grow from 2 million tons 20 years ago of imports to 6.5 million tons this year. And guess what? You've seen a consummate increase in yield. They have further yield to go in corn especially. The late planting was more related to dryness than it was anything else. So I think you're going to see -- you may see a yield impact, again, due to that dry weather pattern that has hovered there and then the late plantings. We'll see what happens with [indiscernible], which is the second crop corn that gets planted because of soybeans being planted late. That means the second crop corn will be planted late. So more to come. We're constructive. We're participating in the Brazilian market and like to see what's happening down there."
