I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week. As you know",650,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week. 
As you know, last Thursday, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and PINK global businesses, collectively, Victoria's Secret to Sycamore Partners for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by the Board with input from outside financial advisers designed to best position our brands for long-term success and to drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business, enhanced management focus and reduce structural complexity. 
Additionally, we believe that our private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. While we recognize that Victoria's Secret's performance has deteriorated meaningfully over the last several years, the brand leads the lingerie category in North America and has high levels of global awareness. 
We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a fresh perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand. 
Andrew Meslow, former Chief Operating Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. He's been with the business for 15 years and has an exceptional understanding of the business and its customers. Nick Coe, previously Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been named Vice Chairman, a Bath & Body Works brand strategy and new ventures. In his new role, he will focus more intently on the strategic position of the business, the evolution of the brand, product development and new ventures and acquisitions. 
We are confident that this succession plan, which leverages the unique partnership established by Nick and Andrew to advance the long-term strategic direction of the brand, is the best arrangement for the business. 
Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Les Wexner will step down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as approximately $500 million in excess balance sheet cash to reduce debt. There are also about $2.5 billion in balance sheet lease liabilities related to Victoria's Secret. After accounting for the expected debt and lease liability declines on an adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis, we expect that our overall leverage ratio will be close to its current level. 
We know that you have many questions about what the new stand-alone Bath & Body Works business will look like from a financial perspective. In the investor presentation, which we made available with the transaction announcement, we have allocated our international business and [ massed ] functions to Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works for the past 5 years. 
Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business with a view to simplifying our existing structure and recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret business through transition services agreements with various terms, which will minimize near-term dissynergies. 
The management team, in conjunction with our Board, we'll also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. It is our intent, and we have greater clarity on the above, to conduct meetings with analysts and investors and provide the financial characteristics and growth plans for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. 
Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

So there was significant interest in the brand for the reasons I think that you are in and the capital markets and people generally understand. With that said, as you know, the results of the brand, including the financial results, have been challenged, and that pattern continued in 2019 and is projected to continue certainly for a portion of 2020. And so while an iconic brand with leading positions in key markets financially, as you know, has been reported financially, the business has gone through a very challenging period financially. And again, that continued and accelerated in some regards in the fourth quarter. 
And so management with advice from financial and legal advisers and heavy input from the Board as appropriate, a very substantial process was undertaken, and from that, got to the conclusions of a sale of a majority interest and certainly had interest from a number of parties, but through a process that you would understand would occur got to the deal that we've disclosed with Sycamore. 
With respect to the potential of the business and how we thought about it, we felt strongly about retain a stake. As you mentioned, this is an iconic brand with very strong positions. And with new leadership and new perspective coming from Sycamore who has a lot of experience in the retail sector, as you know, we believe that this business can be stabilized and turned around. And that significant value can be created and specifically for L Brands shareholders through that 45% retained stake. That's part of the sale of the majority interest. 
So a thorough process, thoughtful process, meaningful interest, retaining a stake to participate in upside. We have a history in our own past with respect to other transactions that we've entered into in the rationalization of our portfolio, whether it was alliance data systems or express or other businesses, the sourcing business for [ massed ], warrants that we had on [indiscernible] all kinds of different ways that we retained interest in businesses sold, majority interest sold. And in each of those cases, L Brands shareholders benefited from the value created monetized through that retained interest. So it's a terrific business. We will be providing significant support to the business, as mentioned, through these transition service arrangements doing so to try to minimize dissynergies that could otherwise occur if one rushed with respect to those things. 
So we think we've got a good form of transaction. We're energized about the future. We have some experience, importantly, with Sycamore, good experience with them as an organization. And so the combination of all those things, again, through a thorough process overseen by the Board has got us to this outcome."

I think in some respects, we might see differences in execution, if you will, in terms of how those opportunities are pursued. But as indicated, the transaction was signed. The definitive agreements, I should say, were signed a week ago at 3:15 in the morning, and I happen to know that. And the time between signing and closing will be roundly 3 months subject to regulatory approvals and other work. 
And so in terms of specifically, what will change, obviously, the transaction needs to close. And the current leadership of the business will engage appropriately, and some of that's already begun with Sycamore as to a relying of where the business is and what its best opportunities are. And from that, as we move through -- as the business, I should say, moves through 2020, a rearticulation of the strategy and changes that may come from new perspective will become apparent and evolve as the business moves through over the next 12 to 18 months. That would be my expectation -- our expectation."

And to do that, managing margin rates and expenses with discipline and growing operating income dollars pretty effectively. That's been at the 9% to 10% CAGR range, both top line and operating income over the last several years. The business has had a very strong run. We have reasons to believe that the business has a lot of future potential. But in terms of financial planning, if you will, the business tends to think about those things with appropriate balance because it serves the business well in terms of the management of risks and investments and so on and so forth. And we believe that there's comp growth in the low-single range. There's ongoing growth in the direct channel. That's growing at a very healthy rate. There's some growth potential in terms of number of stores, but want to manage that carefully in terms of making sure that we're -- they're managing risk related to real estate in a thoughtful way we have been. You've heard a lot about the White Barn remodels. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate plans. And importantly, the growth of -- get into a subject that I know is out there a bit, just while we have the opportunity. The growth in store count in 2020 is expected to be substantially all outside of enclosed shopping malls, and we have a lot of flexibility in that plan. So sales growth related to store count, comp growth, very strong growth, online are all drivers of growth. And again, managing the margin rates carefully and the expense structure carefully.

With respect to tariff impact for BBW -- thank you. Yes. The impact in terms of year-on-year impact in 2020 will be a little more than $0.01 a share for the full year. So some pressure, but not extraordinary pressure. And that'll moderate as we -- it's a little more weighted to spring than to fall. So some pressure on tariffs. And there is just generally inflation in the supply chain. Generally, there's inflation in most world economies and inflation in the supply chain. The business has been able to largely offset that. But there's -- to the extent that there's degradation in the merchandise margin rates at BBW, it's a function of the shift of business from, or I should say, it's not really shifted, but the outpaced growth of direct -- so direct growing at a very fast rate and a lower merchandise margin rate for that business, even though the bottom line is similar to the store's profit rate, but some channel mix effect related to direct and then some cost pressure impact tariffs being one driver of it. And then consumers are strongly reacting to big days where there's a little bit of headline promotion, and the dollar results are very good. But the strength of consumer reaction on some of these big days has a little bit of pressure on the rate. So 3 drivers of a little bit of rate pressure in that business. But overall, still very healthy dollar growth, margin dollars and operating income dollars."

So again, I just rattle off a lot of stuff, about 260 doors ending the year, growing about 20%. Retail sales growing about 30%. Our revenue, as you would expect, growing about 30%, a royalty-based model and a very high profit rate business, delivering operating income in '19 of -- in round numbers, about $30 million.

So the lift that we see when we remodel a store to the -- what we refer to as the White Barn format, which is most typically the shop-in-shop format, is roughly 20%. And that lift sustains, meaning it's not a boom [indiscernible] where you get it for a short period of time and then it reverts back to where it was before. It sustains in multiple years. We've analyzed the heck out of this, or I should say, the BBW team, along with the real estate team, both have analyzed the heck out of this, and that lift persists and do a good financial outcome and allows us -- has allowed us to remodel a very large portion of the fleet. So that would be the perspective on the remodels. 
With respect to the new store activity, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, substantially, all the new stores are off-mall, not an enclosed shopping malls, in power strips with a very strong economic profile. We -- of course, you would expect that we look at cannibalization. We do. But think of it as, as we close stores, we're closing stores in mid-tier or lower-tier malls. And then we're opening stores in power strips. Now about 45% -- a little more than 45% of the business' stores are not in enclosed shopping malls. So it's a sound approach and strategy. We've gotten more experience. You might ask, well, why the acceleration? It's because the ones that we have done in the last 12, 18, 24 months have performed so well that we're pursuing it with more intensity. And all that said, we got a lot of flexibility. So even in the 2020 plan that we shared, roundly, only about 25% of those leases are actually signed. So we've got a lot of flexibility should we see some dramatic change in the business. We're not expecting that, obviously. But should we see that, we've got a lot of flexibility. 
So we believe the real estate strategy is a good one, and it's further shifting the business to locations outside enclosed shopping malls."

And so the areas of the business that have the longer terms in terms of the length or duration of TSA are those that have greater scale and/or complexity. And so the longest TSA and the one that's the most complex is the TSA related to technology. And we'll work carefully in partnership with Sycamore [indiscernible] Victoria's business to, over time, migrate systems and separate systems at logical points that minimize the economic cost. And so the specific amount of dissynergies is to be determined. But unlike perhaps some other transactions that we may have read about, we don't have to separate all these systems on day 1 or is it our intention to do that. But in fact, what we're going to do is share many systems for a meaningful period of time. And again, at logical points of separation, we will separate the systems. And we believe from that, that we will incur less onetime cost and less dissynergy than we would expect or that we otherwise might incur. 
Apart from that, there are opportunities through a simpler go-forward business, the Bath & Body Works business specifically. The amount of corporate overhead and complexity will be substantially reduced. And so there are going to be some dissynergies related to the subjects that we talked about and offsetting that, and we'll work out the dollars as we learn more. And we've done some initial work on it, but not yet ready for -- hadn't been finalized and more to do before we get more specific about it. But there will be opportunities to simplify this business from a multidivisional business now to a single business called Bath & Body Works.

With respect to free cash flow, we've got more work to do, obviously, on the capital structure of the Bath & Body Works business, which we've mentioned. And I don't want to kind of shorthand that and give pieces of it without providing the whole picture. You know the profitability of the business. It was asked and answered about the CapEx, but we're doing more work on it. And in terms of the overall cash flow characteristics of Bath & Body, they're terrific, obviously, by the way. But in terms of a full assessment of it, which, ultimately, I think, will get to the question of dividend policy, you appreciate that, that should be done in a comprehensive way, which we will do. And when we're ready to talk about it, we'll talk about it. So that would be my views on BBW free cash flow. And we'll get to it as soon as we can, but we want to do it thoughtfully. And you can appreciate, hopefully, we've been busy with some other things. 
And then thirdly, with respect to the mid-single-digit comp, getting to breakeven-ish or not a lot of growth, I should say, year-on-year growth, not breakeven, got a lot of year-on-year growth in operating income. Amie mentioned that it's a smaller quarter.

With respect to tech investment, otherwise in BBW, as I mentioned, a lot of the online platform for this business is outsourced. But to the extent that the company needs to invest in things like the buy online, pick up in store functionality, we won't be constrained there. We don't have a specific game plan there in terms of the CapEx profile of that given that we're just in what I'll call a manual test mode right now.

Could you step back a minute, are there any other areas besides leases on liabilities that stay with LB? Just in case we miss anything. And then maybe even bigger picture, how would you frame the downside that LB retains with this deal versus how much opportunity L Brands has to participate in the upside if the results do turn a corner? The obvious math to keep [ 45% ] of the business, but do you participate linearly in the upside if the EBIT turns?"

A lot in that question. So our downside is limited for reasons you would understand. We have the exposure related to lease liabilities that's been asked about, again, on a gross or aggregate basis, around $400 million. There are provisions on how much debt can be put on the business that -- on the VS business that were negotiated and agreed. So we've got, I think, good protection there in terms of how that might be managed. 
With respect to capital contribution requirements, there are essentially none of significance. And there's a lot of upside in just doing the math of what this business could be worth if. We all thought about what this business was worth 5 or 6 years ago and the capital markets were ascribing no value to it, if not negative value to it. And so it was important to us to retain a stake in that potential value creation, and that 45%, that's a meaningful stake. So there is some downside. We've framed it or bracketed it for you. And there's a heck of a lot of upside that potentially could be very, very significant. If you just went back and did math off of what the business had done at its peak, if you even took half of that in terms of its potential, the upside is very significant. But at this time, we felt it was important to have the value of Bath & Body Works realized in the marketplace to have new input and ownership perspective through a private format. And we believe that those results have the potential to deliver a lot of value to shareholders. Arguably, they already have delivered value to shareholders if one looks at the share price move between early January and what has happened since then. So that's how we thought about it."

I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week.As you know,",648,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week.
As you know, last Thursday, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and PINK global businesses, collectively, Victoria's Secret, to Sycamore Partners for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by the Board, with input from outside financial advisers, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and to drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.
Additionally, we believe that our private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. While we recognize that Victoria's Secret's performance has deteriorated meaningfully over the last several years, the brand leads the lingerie category in North America and has high levels of global awareness.
We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a fresh perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.
Andrew Meslow, former Chief Operating Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. He's been with the business for 15 years and has an exceptional understanding of the business and its customers. Nick Coe, previously Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been named Vice Chairman of Bath & Body Works Brand Strategy and New Ventures. In his new role, he will focus more intently on the strategic position of the business, the evolution of the brand, product development and new ventures and acquisitions.
We are confident that this succession plan, which leverages the unique partnership established by Nick and Andrew to advance the long-term strategic direction of the brand, is the best arrangement for the business.
Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Les Wexner will step down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board.
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as approximately $500 million in excess balance sheet cash to reduce debt. There are also about $2.5 billion in balance sheet lease liabilities related to Victoria's Secret. After accounting for the expected debt and lease liability declines, on an adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis, we expect that our overall leverage ratio will be close to its current level.
We know that you have many questions about what the new stand-alone Bath & Body Works business will look like from a financial perspective. In the investor presentation, which we made available with the transaction announcement, we have allocated our international business and Mast functions to Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works for the past 5 years.
Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business with a view to simplifying our existing structure and recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret business through transition services agreements with various terms, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.
The management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. It is our intent when we have greater clarity on the above to conduct meetings with analysts and investors and provide the financial characteristics and growth plans for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business.
Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

So there was significant interest in the brand for the reasons I think that you, Omar, and the capital markets and people generally understand. With that said, as you know, the results of the brand, including the financial results, have been challenged, and that pattern continued in 2019 and is projected to continue certainly for a portion of 2020. And so while an iconic brand with leading positions in key markets, financially -- as you know, has been reported financially, the business has gone through a very challenging period financially, and again, that continued and accelerated in some regards in the fourth quarter.
And so management with advice from financial and legal advisers and heavy input from the Board as appropriate, a very substantial process was undertaken and from that, got to the conclusions of a sale of a majority interest and certainly had interest from a number of parties, but through a process that you would understand would occur, got to the deal that we've disclosed with Sycamore.
With respect to the potential of the business and how we thought about it, we felt strongly about retaining a stake. As you mentioned, this is an iconic brand with very strong positions. And with new leadership and new perspective coming from Sycamore who has a lot of experience in the retail sector, as you know, we believe that this business can be stabilized and turned around. And that significant value can be created and specifically for L Brands shareholders through that 45% retained stake. That's part of the sale of the majority interest.
So a thorough process, thoughtful process, meaningful interest, retaining a stake to participate in upside. We have a history in our own past with respect to other transactions that we've entered into in the rationalization of our portfolio, whether it was Alliance Data Systems or Express or other businesses, the sourcing business for Mast, warrants that we had on Lerner, all kinds of different ways that we retained interest in businesses sold, majority interest sold. And in each of those cases, L Brands shareholders benefited from the value created, monetized through that retained interest.
So it's a terrific business. We will be providing significant support to the business, as mentioned, through these transition service arrangements, doing so to try to minimize dissynergies that could otherwise occur if one rushed with respect to those things.
So we think we've got a good form of transaction. We're energized about the future. We have some experience importantly with Sycamore, good experience with them as an organization. And so the combination of all those things, again, through a thorough process overseen by the Board has got us to this outcome. Thank you, Omar."

The definitive agreements, I should say, were signed a week ago at 3:15 in the morning, and I happen to know that. And the time between signing and closing will be roundly 3 months subject to regulatory approvals and other work.
And so in terms of specifically, what will change, obviously, the transaction needs to close. And the current leadership of the business will engage appropriately, and some of that's already begun with Sycamore as to a relaying of where the business is and what its best opportunities are. And from that, as we move through -- as the business, I should say, moves through 2020, a re-articulation of the strategy and changes that may come from new perspective will become apparent and evolve as the business moves through over the next 12 to 18 months.

That's been at the 9% to 10% CAGR range, both top line and operating income, over the last several years. The business has had a very strong run. We have reasons to believe that the business has a lot of future potential.
But in terms of financial planning, if you will, the business tends to think about those things with appropriate balance because it serves the business well in terms of the management of risks and investments and so on and so forth. And we believe that there's comp growth in the low single range. There's ongoing growth in the direct channel. That's growing at a very healthy rate. There's some growth potential in terms of number of stores but want to manage that carefully in terms of making sure that we're -- they're managing risk related to real estate in a thoughtful way we have been. You've heard a lot about the White Barn remodels. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate plans. And importantly, the growth of -- get into a subject that I know is out there a bit just while we have the opportunity. The growth in store count in 2020 is expected to be substantially all outside of enclosed shopping malls, and we have a lot of flexibility in that plan.
So sales growth related to store count, comp growth, very strong growth, online are all drivers of growth. And again, managing the margin rates carefully and the expense structure carefully, and historically, that's resulted in a very strong overall financial results."

With respect to tariff impact for BBW -- thank you. Yes. The impact in terms of year-on-year impact in 2020 will be a little more than $0.01 a share for the full year. So some pressure but not extraordinary pressure. And that'll moderate as we -- it's a little more weighted to spring than to fall. So some pressure on tariffs.
And there is just generally inflation in the supply chain. Generally, there's inflation in most world economies and inflation in the supply chain. The business has been able to largely offset that. But there's -- to the extent that there's degradation in the merchandise margin rates at BBW, it's a function of the shift of business from -- or I should say, it's not really shift, but the outpaced growth of direct. So direct growing at a very fast rate and a lower merchandise margin rate for that business, even though the bottom line is similar to the store's profit rate, but some channel mix effect related to direct and then some cost pressure impact, tariffs being one driver of it.
And then consumers are strongly reacting to big days where there's a little bit of headline promotion, and the dollar results are very good. But the strength of consumer reaction on some of these big days has a little bit of pressure on the rate. So 3 drivers of a little bit of rate pressure in that business.

So the lift that we see when we remodel a store to the -- what we refer to as the White Barn format, which is most typically the shop-in-shop format, is roughly 20%. And that lift sustains, meaning it's not a boom splat where you get it for a short period of time and then it reverts back to where it was before. It sustains in multiple years. We've analyzed the heck out of this, or I should say, the BBW team, along with the real estate team, both have analyzed the heck out of this, and that lift persists and gets to a good financial outcome and allows us -- has allowed us to remodel a very large portion of the fleet. So that would be the perspective on the remodels.
With respect to the new store activity, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, substantially, all the new stores are off-mall, not in enclosed shopping malls, in power strips with a very strong economic profile. We -- of course, you would expect that we look at cannibalization. We do. But think of it as, as we close stores, we're closing stores in mid-tier or lower-tier malls. And then we're opening stores in power strips. Now about 45% -- a little more than 45% of the business' stores are not in enclosed shopping malls.
So it's a sound approach and strategy. We've gotten more experience. You might ask, well, why the acceleration? It's because the ones that we have done in the last 12, 18, 24 months have performed so well that we're pursuing it with more intensity.
And all that said, we got a lot of flexibility. So even in the 2020 plan that we shared, roundly, only about 25% of those leases are actually signed. So we've got a lot of flexibility should we see some dramatic change in the business. We're not expecting that, obviously. But should we see that, we've got a lot of flexibility.
So we believe the real estate strategy is a good one, and it's further shifting the business to locations outside enclosed shopping malls."

So the first thing I'd say is we're going to work like heck to minimize the dissynergies, which is what you would expect us to do. And so the areas of the business that have the longer terms in terms of the length or duration of TSA are those that have greater scale and/or complexity. And so the longest TSA and the one that's the most complex is the TSA related to technology.
And we'll work carefully in partnership with Sycamore on the Victoria's business to, over time, migrate systems and separate systems at logical points that minimize the economic cost. And so the specific amount of dissynergies is to be determined. But unlike perhaps some other transactions that we may have read about, we don't have to separate all these systems on day 1, nor is it our intention to do that. But in fact, what we're going to do is share many systems for a meaningful period of time. And again, at logical points of separation, we will separate the systems. And we believe from that, that we will incur less onetime cost and less dissynergy than we would expect or that we otherwise might incur.
Apart from that, there are opportunities through a simpler go-forward business, the Bath & Body Works business specifically. The amount of corporate overhead and complexity will be substantially reduced. And so there are going to be some dissynergies related to the subjects that we talked about and offsetting that, and we'll work out the dollars as we learn more. And we've done some initial work on it but not yet ready for -- hadn't been finalized and more to do before we get more specific about it. But there will be opportunities to simplify this business from a multidivisional business now to a single business called Bath & Body Works. And from that, there will be opportunities to offset some dissynergies with reductions in corporate and other overheads. Thank you."

So if times get tough, we can hit the brake pretty hard. The profile for BBW will be lower, obviously, than the LB total. That's why you're asking about it. And again, ballpark number, $300 million or $350 million would be a good starting assumption."

With respect to free cash flow, we'",304,"Yes. So 3 questions. First is on comp results so far in February, we're not going to comment on that. I don't mean to be unhelpful, but we're comfortable with the guidance we've given and that's all I'll say about that. With respect to free cash flow, we've got more work to do, obviously, on the capital structure of the Bath & Body Works business, which we've mentioned. And I don't want to kind of shorthand that and give pieces of it without providing the whole picture. You know the profitability of the business. It was asked and answered about the CapEx, but we're doing more work on it.
And in terms of the overall cash flow characteristics of Bath & Body, they're terrific, obviously, by the way. But in terms of a full assessment of it, which, ultimately, I think, will get to the question of dividend policy, you appreciate that, that should be done in a comprehensive way, which we will do. And when we're ready to talk about it, we'll talk about it. So that would be my views on BBW free cash flow. And we'll get to it as soon as we can, but we want to do it thoughtfully. And you can appreciate, hopefully, we've been busy with some other things.
And then thirdly, with respect to the mid-single-digit comp, getting to breakeven-ish -- or not a lot of growth, I should say, year-on-year growth, not breakeven, not a lot of year-on-year growth in operating income, Amie mentioned that it's a smaller quarter. And so as you think about leverage on fixed and variable costs, the result that you're asking about for Q1 doesn't translate through all the quarters just based on the relative size of the quarter. So that would be my additional view on your third question."

I would love to get some feedback on how that is performing and how much more that customer involved in loyalty program is spending, how much more they're frequenting your stores.

So with respect to the loyalty program, we mentioned about it's in -- just shy of 300 stores. The business is pleased with the overall results and is evaluating the rollout timing to the balance of the fleet. So that -- those would be the headlines. It is a points-based or rewards-based program based on her spending. It involves a mobile app and provides her, in addition to value, of points in financial reward, gives her the opportunity to participate in some exclusive events and new products and so on. So it's got some texture on it beyond just quote a discount, if you will. So generally pleased with it and determining the best way to roll it out to more stores and ultimately, nationally.
With respect to tech investment, otherwise, in BBW, as I mentioned, a lot of the online platform for this business is outsourced. But to the extent that the company needs to invest in things like the buy online, pick up in store functionality, we won't be constrained there. We don't have a specific game plan there in terms of the CapEx profile of that given that we're just in what I'll call a manual test mode right now. But there is opportunity there as you would appreciate. And the business will have plenty of cash flow to invest in that as that opportunity reveals itself. And to some extent that we may do that working with our partners, meaning third parties, and some of that work we may do internally. Thanks."

Apart from that -- or I should say, in addition to that, the conversion rates are extraordinarily high off-mall, which you would expect. It's more of a destination occasion. The good news about Bath & Body Works is based on its merchandise offering and the nature of the experience with customers, Bath & Body is a destination, both in-malls and off-malls, but the conversion rates are very high off-mall.
And lastly, occupancy costs as a percent of sales are lower off-mall than they are in enclosed shopping malls. So the off-mall format is very strong financially. But again, both types of store, if you will, are doing well, good growth, good profitability. The off-mall opportunity is a big one. And as you heard earlier, we're pursuing it aggressively.
As a general matter, our lease terms are 10-year leases. As you know, we've talked about consistently in many of our stores based on -- these are in lower-tier malls. We have a lot of flexibility on month-to-month terms, and we get to that place just based on the strength of our business and the provisions in our leases related to occupancy levels and whether named tenants are doing business in those malls. So a lot of flexibility on -- in many situations. Generally, 10-year lease terms. Thanks."

A lot in that question. So our downside is limited for reasons you would understand.

There are provisions on how much debt can be put on the business that -- on the VS business that were negotiated and agreed. So we've got, I think, good protection there in terms of how that might be managed.
With respect to capital contribution requirements, there are essentially none of significance. And there's a lot of upside in just doing the math of what this business could be worth. If we all thought about what this business was worth 5 or 6 years ago, and the capital markets were ascribing no value to it, if not negative value to it. And so it was important to us to retain a stake in that potential value creation, and that 45%, that's a meaningful stake. So there is some downside. We've framed it or bracketed it for you. And there's a heck of a lot of upside that potentially could be very, very significant. If you just went back and did math off of what the business had done at its peak, if you even took half of that in terms of its potential, the upside is very significant. But at this time, we felt it was important to have the value of Bath & Body Works realized in the marketplace to have new input and ownership perspective through a private format. And we believe that those results have the potential to deliver a lot of value to shareholders. Arguably, they already have delivered value to shareholders if one looks at the share price moved between early January and what has happened since then. So that's how we thought about it. Thanks."

I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week.As you know,",648,"Thanks, Amie, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week.
As you know, last Thursday, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and PINK global businesses, collectively Victoria's Secret, to Sycamore Partners for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by the Board, with input from outside financial advisers, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and to drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.
Additionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. While we recognize that Victoria's Secret's performance has deteriorated meaningfully over the last several years, the brand leads the lingerie category in North America and has high levels of global awareness.
We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a fresh perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.
Andrew Meslow, former Chief Operating Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. He's been with the business for 15 years and has an exceptional understanding of the business and its customers. Nick Coe, previously Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been named Vice Chairman of Bath & Body Works Brand Strategy and New Ventures. In his new role, he will focus more intently on the strategic position of the business, the evolution of the brand, product development and new ventures and acquisitions.
We are confident that this succession plan, which leverages the unique partnership established by Nick and Andrew to advance the long-term strategic direction of the brand, is the best arrangement for the business.
Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Les Wexner will step down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board.
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as approximately $500 million in excess balance sheet cash to reduce debt. There are also about $2.5 billion in balance sheet lease liabilities related to Victoria's Secret. After accounting for the expected debt and lease liability declines, on an adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis, we expect that our overall leverage ratio will be close to its current level.
We know that you have many questions about what the new stand-alone Bath & Body Works business will look like from a financial perspective. In the investor presentation, which we made available with the transaction announcement, we have allocated our international business and Mast functions to Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works for the past 5 years.
Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business with a view to simplifying our existing structure and recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret business through transition services agreements with various terms, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.
The management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. It is our intent when we have greater clarity on the above to conduct meetings with analysts and investors and provide the financial characteristics and growth plans for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business.
Thanks, and over to you, Amie."

So there was significant interest in the brand for the reasons I think that you, Omar, and the capital markets and people generally understand. With that said, as you know, the results of the brand, including the financial results, have been challenged, and that pattern continued in 2019 and is projected to continue certainly for a portion of 2020. And so while an iconic brand with leading positions in key markets, financially -- as you know, as has been reported financially, the business has gone through a very challenging period financially, and again, that continued and accelerated in some regards in the fourth quarter.
And so management with advice from financial and legal advisers and heavy input from the Board as appropriate, a very substantial process was undertaken. And from that, got to the conclusions of a sale of a majority interest and certainly had interest from a number of parties, but through a process that you would understand would occur, got to the deal that we've disclosed with Sycamore.
With respect to the potential of the business and how we thought about it, we felt strongly about retaining a stake. As you mentioned, this is an iconic brand with very strong positions. And with new leadership and new perspective coming from Sycamore who has a lot of experience in the retail sector, as you know, we believe that this business can be stabilized and turned around. And that significant value can be created and specifically for L Brands shareholders through that 45% retained stake. That's part of the sale of the majority interest.
So a thorough process, thoughtful process, meaningful interest, retaining a stake to participate in upside. We have a history in our own past with respect to other transactions that we've entered into in the rationalization of our portfolio, whether it was Alliance Data Systems or Express or other businesses, the sourcing business for Mast, warrants that we had on Lerner, all kinds of different ways that we retained interest in businesses sold, majority interest sold. And in each of those cases, L Brands shareholders benefited from the value created, monetized through that retained interest.
So it's a terrific business. We will be providing significant support to the business, as mentioned, through these transition service arrangements, doing so to try to minimize dissynergies that could otherwise occur if one rushed with respect to those things.
So we think we've got a good form of transaction. We're energized about the future. We have some experience importantly with Sycamore, good experience with them as an organization. And so the combination of all those things, again, through a thorough process overseen by the Board has got us to this outcome. Thank you, Omar."

And so in terms of specifically, what will change, obviously, the transaction needs to close.

And with that said, there will be regular delivery of newness in the merchandise assortments, which has been the goal of the business over time and in most periods, delivered very effectively.
So from a merchandise category standpoint, no revolutionary change in 2020 because it's not needed. The business is running well. And again, with that said, I wouldn't want you to think that the business thinks about just selling the same thing day after day and month after month.

But the business has the potential, and has delivered this pretty consistently, to deliver comps in the low to mid-single range in most periods of time, and to do that, managing margin rates and expenses with discipline and growing operating income dollars pretty effectively. That's been at the 9% to 10% CAGR range, both top line and operating income, over the last several years. The business has had a very strong run. We have reasons to believe that the business has a lot of future potential.
But in terms of financial planning, if you will, the business tends to think about those things with appropriate balance because it serves the business well in terms of the management of risks and investments and so on and so forth. And we believe that there's comp growth in the low single range. There's ongoing growth in the direct channel. That's growing at a very healthy rate. There's some growth potential in terms of number of stores but want to manage that carefully in terms of making sure that we're -- they're managing risk related to real estate in a thoughtful way we have been. You've heard a lot about the White Barn remodels. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate plans. And importantly, the growth of -- I'll get into a subject that I know is out there a bit just while we have the opportunity. The growth in store count in 2020 is expected to be substantially all outside of enclosed shopping malls, and we have a lot of flexibility in that plan.
So sales growth related to store count, comp growth, very strong growth, online are all drivers of growth. And again, managing the margin rates carefully and the expense structure carefully, and historically, that's resulted in a very strong overall financial result."

With respect to tariff impact for BBW -- thank you. Yes. The impact in terms of year-on-year impact in 2020 will be a little more than $0.01 a share for the full year. So some pressure but not extraordinary pressure. And that'll moderate as we -- it's a little more weighted to spring than to fall. So some pressure on tariffs.
And there is just generally inflation in the supply chain. Generally, there's inflation in most world economies and inflation in the supply chain. The business has been able to largely offset that. But there's -- to the extent that there's degradation in the merchandise margin rates at BBW, it's a function of the shift of business from -- or I should say, it's not really a shift, but the outpaced growth of direct. So direct growing at a very fast rate and a lower merchandise margin rate for that business, even though the bottom line is similar to the store's profit rate, but some channel mix effect related to direct and then some cost pressure impact, tariffs being one driver of it.
And then consumers are strongly reacting to big days where there's a little bit of headline promotion, and the dollar results are very good. But the strength of consumer reaction on some of these big days has a little bit of pressure on the rate. So 3 drivers of a little bit of rate pressure in that business. But overall, still very healthy dollar growth, margin dollars and operating income dollars. Thanks."

So the lift that we see when we remodel a store to the -- what we refer to as the White Barn format, which is most typically the shop-in-shop format, is roughly 20%. And that lift sustains, meaning it's not a boom splat where you get it for a short period of time and then it reverts back to where it was before. It sustains in multiple years. We've analyzed the heck out of this, or I should say, the BBW team, along with the real estate team, both have analyzed the heck out of this, and that lift persists and gets to a good financial outcome and allows us -- has allowed us to remodel a very large portion of the fleet. So that would be the perspective on the remodels.
With respect to the new store activity, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, substantially, all the new stores are off-mall, not in enclosed shopping malls, in power strips with a very strong economic profile. We -- of course, you would expect that we look at cannibalization, and we do. But think of it as, as we close stores, we're closing stores in mid-tier or lower-tier malls. And then we're opening stores in power strips. Now about 45% -- a little more than 45% of the business' stores are not in enclosed shopping malls.
So it's a sound approach and strategy. We've gotten more experience. You might ask, well, why the acceleration? It's because the ones that we have done in the last 12, 18, 24 months have performed so well that we're pursuing it with more intensity.
And all that said, we got a lot of flexibility. So even in the 2020 plan that we shared, roundly, only about 25% of those leases are actually signed. So we've got a lot of flexibility should we see some dramatic change in the business. We're not expecting that, obviously. But should we see that, we've got a lot of flexibility.
So we believe the real estate strategy is a good one, and it's further shifting the business to locations outside enclosed shopping malls. Thanks."

And so the areas of the business that have the longer terms in terms of the length or duration of TSA are those that have greater scale and/or complexity. And so the longest TSA and the one that's the most complex is the TSA related to technology.
And we'll work carefully in partnership with Sycamore on the Victoria's business to, over time, migrate systems and separate systems at logical points that minimize the economic cost. And so the specific amount of dissynergies is to be determined. But unlike perhaps some other transactions that we may have read about, we don't have to separate all these systems on day 1, nor is it our intention to do that. But in fact, what we're going to do is share many systems for a meaningful period of time. And again, at logical points of separation, we will separate the systems. And we believe from that, that we will incur less onetime cost and less dissynergy than we would expect or that we otherwise might incur.
Apart from that, there are opportunities through a simpler go-forward business, the Bath & Body Works business specifically. The amount of corporate overhead and complexity will be substantially reduced. And so there are going to be some dissynergies related to the subjects that we talked about and offsetting that, and we'll work out the dollars as we learn more. And we've done some initial work on it but not yet ready for -- hadn't been finalized and more to do before we get more specific about it. But there will be opportunities to simplify this business from a multidivisional business now to a single business called Bath & Body Works.

In round numbers, I would say -- and this is driven by the investments in real estate, but in round numbers, I would say, between $300 million and $350 million. And again, that reflects the majority of that related to the remodeling of stores and the opening of new stores that we've talked about. We'll have more work to do on it, but we've done some initial work on it, and it's in that range. 
And with that said, a lot of that is very flexible. And so on the real estate CapEx, we have an ability to make adjustments to that quickly. In our own history, back in the great recession of 2009, we took our CapEx from $500 million or $600 million run rate, this is for the whole LB company, down to about $200 million in the span of about 12 months.
So if times get tough, we can hit the brake pretty hard. The profile for BBW will be lower, obviously, than the LB total. That's why you're asking about it. And again, ballpark number, $300 million to $350 million would be a good starting assumption."

It's been broad-based. As we tighten up our communication about Bath & Body works over the next few months, we'll really hone in on that opportunity in framing that opportunity, Paul.
But again, for the last part of your question, I wouldn't say it's been constrained in any way because of the -- it's formed being part of L Brands, but it is a big opportunity. And frankly, we were -- if we go back 3 or 4 years, Paul, we've been surprised in a good way, a positive surprise about consumers' reaction to Bath & Body Works in different major regions of the world.

But we're -- on an overall basis, we're pretty pleased.
There are 2 initiatives that the business is pursuing. They're both in pilot stage. One is buy online, pick up in store. This is for Bath & Body in a pilot stage. And then the other is, for now, probably a couple of years in total, a lot of refinement given the importance of it, is a pilot that the business has pursued with respect to a loyalty program that is now in about 300 -- roundly 300 stores. And so in terms of initiatives, buy online, pick up in store, something in front of us and further refinement and then rollout of the loyalty pilot that's been going on now for probably 18, 24 months.

I don't mean to be unhelpful, but we're comfortable with the guidance we've given and that's all I'll say about that. With respect to free cash flow, we've got more work to do, obviously, on the capital structure of the Bath & Body Works business, which we've mentioned. And I don't want to kind of shorthand that and give pieces of it without providing the whole picture. You know the profitability of the business. It was asked and answered about the CapEx, but we're doing more work on it.
And in terms of the overall cash flow characteristics of Bath & Body, they're terrific, obviously, by the way. But in terms of a full assessment of it, which, ultimately, I think, we'll get to the question of dividend policy, you appreciate that, that should be done in a comprehensive way, which we will do. And when we're ready to talk about it, we'll talk about it. So that would be my views on BBW free cash flow. And we'll get to it as soon as we can, but we want to do it thoughtfully. And you can appreciate, hopefully, we've been busy with some other things.
And then thirdly, with respect to the mid-single-digit comp, getting to breakeven-ish -- or not a lot of growth, I should say, year-on-year growth, not breakeven, not a lot of year-on-year growth in operating income, Amie mentioned that it's a smaller quarter. And so as you think about leverage on fixed and variable costs, the result that you're asking about for Q1 doesn't translate through all the quarters just based on the relative size of the quarter. So that would be my additional view on your third question. Thanks."

So it's got some texture on it beyond just ""a discount, if you will. So generally pleased with it and determining the best way to roll it out to more stores and ultimately, nationally.
With respect to tech investment, otherwise, in BBW, as I mentioned, a lot of the online platform for this business is outsourced. But to the extent that the company needs to invest in things like the buy online, pick up in store functionality, we won't be constrained there. We don't have a specific game plan there in terms of the CapEx profile of that given that we're just in what I'll call a manual test mode right now. But there is opportunity there as you would appreciate. And the business will have plenty of cash flow to invest in that as that opportunity reveals itself.

So the first thing I'd want to register and register it clearly is they perform well in both types of venue. Apart from that -- or I should say, in addition to that, the conversion rates are extraordinarily high off-mall, which you would expect. It's more of a destination occasion. The good news about Bath & Body Works is based on its merchandise offering and the nature of the experience with customers, Bath & Body is a destination, both in-malls and off-malls, but the conversion rates are very high off-mall.
And lastly, occupancy costs as a percent of sales are lower off-mall than they are in enclosed shopping malls. So the off-mall format is very strong financially. But again, both types of store, if you will, are doing well, good growth, good profitability. The off-mall opportunity is a big one. And as you heard earlier, we're pursuing it aggressively.
As a general matter, our lease terms are 10-year leases. As you know, we've talked about consistently in many of our stores based on -- these are in lower-tier malls. We have a lot of flexibility on month-to-month terms, and we get to that place just based on the strength of our business and the provisions in our leases related to occupancy levels and whether named tenants are doing business in those malls.

So our downside is limited for reasons you would understand. We have the exposure related to lease liabilities that's been asked about, and again, on a gross or aggregate basis, around $400 million. There are provisions on how much debt can be put on the business that -- on the VS business that were negotiated and agreed. So we've got, I think, good protection there in terms of how that might be managed.
With respect to capital contribution requirements, there are essentially none of significance. And there's a lot of upside in just doing the math of what this business could be worth. If we all thought about what this business was worth 5 or 6 years ago, and the capital markets were ascribing no value to it, if not negative value to it. And so it was important to us to retain a stake in that potential value creation, and at 45%, that's a meaningful stake. So there is some downside. We've framed it or bracketed it for you. And there's a heck of a lot of upside that potentially could be very, very significant. If you just went back and did math off of what the business had done at its peak, if you even took half of that in terms of its potential, the upside is very significant. But at this time, we felt it was important to have the value of Bath & Body Works realized in the marketplace, to have new input and ownership perspective through a private format. And we believe that those results have the potential to deliver a lot of value to shareholders. Arguably, they already have delivered value to shareholders if one looks at the share price move between early January and what has happened since then. So that's how we thought about it. Thanks."

I'd like to take a few minutes before we open up the call for your questions to highlight some key points related to the transformative transaction with Sycamore Partners that we announced last week.
As you know, last Thursday, we announced the sale of 55% of the Victoria's Secret Lingerie, Victoria's Secret Beauty and PINK global businesses, collectively Victoria's Secret, to Sycamore Partners for proceeds of approximately $525 million. The transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by the Board, with input from outside financial advisers, designed to best position our brands for long-term success and to drive shareholder value. We believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business, enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity.
Additionally, we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a Victoria's Secret turnaround. While we recognize that Victoria's Secret's performance has deteriorated meaningfully over the last several years, the brand leads the lingerie category in North America and has high levels of global awareness.
We believe that Sycamore, which has substantial experience in the retail industry, will bring a fresh perspective and greater focus to the business. We are pleased that by retaining a significant ownership stake, our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand.
Andrew Meslow, former Chief Operating Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer. He's been with the business for 15 years and has an exceptional understanding of the business and its customers. Nick Coe, previously Chief Executive Officer of Bath & Body Works, has been named Vice Chairman of Bath & Body Works Brand Strategy and New Ventures. In his new role, he will focus more intently on the strategic position of the business, the evolution of the brand, product development and new ventures and acquisitions.
We are confident that this succession plan, which leverages the unique partnership established by Nick and Andrew to advance the long-term strategic direction of the brand, is the best arrangement for the business.
Upon the close of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter, Les Wexner will step down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands to become Chairman Emeritus, remaining as a member of the Board.
We intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as approximately $500 million in excess balance sheet cash to reduce debt. There are also about $2.5 billion in balance sheet lease liabilities related to Victoria's Secret. After accounting for the expected debt and lease liability declines, on an adjusted debt to EBITDAR basis, we expect that our overall leverage ratio will be close to its current level.
We know that you have many questions about what the new stand-alone Bath & Body Works business will look like from a financial perspective. In the investor presentation, which we made available with the transaction announcement, we have allocated our international business and Mast functions to Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works for the past 5 years.
Over the next several months, we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business with a view to simplifying our existing structure and recognizing that we will still be supporting the Victoria's Secret business through transition services agreements with various terms, which will minimize near-term dissynergies.
The management team, in conjunction with our Board, will also be evaluating the capital structure and cash priorities for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. It is our intent when we have greater clarity on the above to conduct meetings with analysts and investors and provide the financial characteristics and growth plans for the stand-alone Bath & Body Works business. Thanks.
And over to you, Amie."

And any thoughts -- maybe a little bit more detail or any further thoughts on how the structure of that brand could evolve in a private environment that obviously the public shareholders could still benefit from. Are there certain specific things you guys see in that business that will help it operate better in a more of a private environment?"

So there was significant interest in the brand for the reasons I think that you, Omar, and the capital markets and people generally understand. With that said, as you know, the results of the brand, including the financial results, have been challenged, and that pattern continued in 2019 and is projected to continue certainly for a portion of 2020. And so while an iconic brand with leading positions in key markets, financially -- as you know, as has been reported financially, the business has gone through a very challenging period financially, and again, that continued and accelerated in some regards in the fourth quarter.
And so management with advice from financial and legal advisers and heavy input from the Board as appropriate, a very substantial process was undertaken. And from that, got to the conclusions of a sale of a majority interest and certainly had interest from a number of parties, but through a process that you would understand would occur, got to the deal that we've disclosed with Sycamore.
With respect to the potential of the business and how we thought about it, we felt strongly about retaining a stake. As you mentioned, this is an iconic brand with very strong positions. And with new leadership and new perspective coming from Sycamore who has a lot of experience in the retail sector, as you know, we believe that this business can be stabilized and turned around. And that significant value can be created and specifically for L Brands shareholders through that 45% retained stake. That's part of the sale of the majority interest.
So a thorough process, thoughtful process, meaningful interest, retaining a stake to participate in upside. We have a history in our own past with respect to other transactions that we've entered into in the rationalization of our portfolio, whether it was Alliance Data Systems or Express or other businesses, the sourcing business for Mast, warrants that we had on Lerner, all kinds of different ways that we retained interest in businesses sold, majority interest sold. And in each of those cases, L Brands shareholders benefited from the value created, monetized through that retained interest.
So it's a terrific business. We will be providing significant support to the business, as mentioned, through these transition service arrangements, doing so to try to minimize dissynergies that could otherwise occur if one rushed with respect to those things.
So we think we've got a good form of transaction. We're energized about the future. We have some experience importantly with Sycamore, good experience with them as an organization. And so the combination of all those things, again, through a thorough process overseen by the Board has got us to this outcome. Thank you, Omar."

And so in terms of specifically, what will change, obviously, the transaction needs to close.

But the business has the potential, and has delivered this pretty consistently, to deliver comps in the low to mid-single range in most periods of time, and to do that, managing margin rates and expenses with discipline and growing operating income dollars pretty effectively. That's been at the 9% to 10% CAGR range, both top line and operating income, over the last several years. The business has had a very strong run. We have reasons to believe that the business has a lot of future potential.
But in terms of financial planning, if you will, the business tends to think about those things with appropriate balance because it serves the business well in terms of the management of risks and investments and so on and so forth. And we believe that there's comp growth in the low single range. There's ongoing growth in the direct channel. That's growing at a very healthy rate. There's some growth potential in terms of number of stores but want to manage that carefully in terms of making sure that we're -- they're managing risk related to real estate in a thoughtful way we have been. You've heard a lot about the White Barn remodels. We have a lot of flexibility in our real estate plans. And importantly, the growth of -- I'll get into a subject that I know is out there a bit just while we have the opportunity. The growth in store count in 2020 is expected to be substantially all outside of enclosed shopping malls, and we have a lot of flexibility in that plan.
So sales growth related to store count, comp growth, very strong growth, online are all drivers of growth. And again, managing the margin rates carefully and the expense structure carefully, and historically, that's resulted in a very strong overall financial result."

With respect to tariff impact for BBW -- thank you. Yes. The impact in terms of year-on-year impact in 2020 will be a little more than $0.01 a share for the full year. So some pressure but not extraordinary pressure. And that'll moderate as we -- it's a little more weighted to spring than to fall. So some pressure on tariffs.
And there is just generally inflation in the supply chain. Generally, there's inflation in most world economies and inflation in the supply chain. The business has been able to largely offset that. But there's -- to the extent that there's degradation in the merchandise margin rates at BBW, it's a function of the shift of business from -- or I should say, it's not really a shift, but the outpaced growth of direct. So direct growing at a very fast rate and a lower merchandise margin rate for that business, even though the bottom line is similar to the store's profit rate, but some channel mix effect related to direct and then some cost pressure impact, tariffs being one driver of it.
And then consumers are strongly reacting to big days where there's a little bit of headline promotion, and the dollar results are very good. But the strength of consumer reaction on some of these big days has a little bit of pressure on the rate. So 3 drivers of a little bit of rate pressure in that business. But overall, still very healthy dollar growth, margin dollars and operating income dollars. Thanks."

Thank you. 200 -- about 200 -- ending the year with 266 stores. Retail sales approaching $400 million. Our revenue, round numbers, these are '19 numbers, a little more than $40 million because it's all franchise. And the operating income rate, extraordinarily high, almost 70%.
So again, I just rattled off a lot of stuff. About 260 doors ending the year, growing about 20%. Retail sales growing about 30%. Our revenue, as you would expect, growing about 30%, a royalty-based model. And a very high profit rate business, delivering operating income in '19 of, in round numbers, about $30 million. So it's a terrific business. We see a lot of additional potential growth in this business. It -- today, it's within that international segment. That's part of the LB reporting segments. And as we move forward, I think it'll be more apparent to folks what the value of this is to the business. But hopefully, the profile I've just shared dimensions that for you, and we see a lot of future growth here. Again, retail sales in 2019 grew 30%."

So the lift that we see when we remodel a store to the -- what we refer to as the White Barn format, which is most typically the shop-in-shop format, is roughly 20%. And that lift sustains, meaning it's not a boom splat where you get it for a short period of time and then it reverts back to where it was before. It sustains in multiple years. We've analyzed the heck out of this, or I should say, the BBW team, along with the real estate team, both have analyzed the heck out of this, and that lift persists and gets to a good financial outcome and allows us -- has allowed us to remodel a very large portion of the fleet. So that would be the perspective on the remodels.
With respect to the new store activity, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, substantially, all the new stores are off-mall, not in enclosed shopping malls, in power strips with a very strong economic profile. We -- of course, you would expect that we look at cannibalization, and we do. But think of it as, as we close stores, we're closing stores in mid-tier or lower-tier malls. And then we're opening stores in power strips. Now about 45% -- a little more than 45% of the business' stores are not in enclosed shopping malls.
So it's a sound approach and strategy. We've gotten more experience. You might ask, well, why the acceleration? It's because the ones that we have done in the last 12, 18, 24 months have performed so well that we're pursuing it with more intensity.
And all that said, we got a lot of flexibility. So even in the 2020 plan that we shared, roundly, only about 25% of those leases are actually signed. So we've got a lot of flexibility should we see some dramatic change in the business. We're not expecting that, obviously. But should we see that, we've got a lot of flexibility.
So we believe the real estate strategy is a good one, and it's further shifting the business to locations outside enclosed shopping malls. Thanks."

So the first thing I'd say is we're going to work like heck to minimize the dissynergies, which is what you would expect us to do. And so the areas of the business that have the longer terms in terms of the length or duration of TSA are those that have greater scale and/or complexity. And so the longest TSA and the one that's the most complex is the TSA related to technology.
And we'll work carefully in partnership with Sycamore on the Victoria's business to, over time, migrate systems and separate systems at logical points that minimize the economic cost. And so the specific amount of dissynergies is to be determined. But unlike perhaps some other transactions that we may have read about, we don't have to separate all these systems on day 1, nor is it our intention to do that. But in fact, what we're going to do is share many systems for a meaningful period of time. And again, at logical points of separation, we will separate the systems. And we believe from that, that we will incur less onetime cost and less dissynergy than we would expect or that we otherwise might incur.
Apart from that, there are opportunities through a simpler go-forward business, the Bath & Body Works business specifically. The amount of corporate overhead and complexity will be substantially reduced. And so there are going to be some dissynergies related to the subjects that we talked about and offsetting that, and we'll work out the dollars as we learn more. And we've done some initial work on it but not yet ready for -- hadn't been finalized and more to do before we get more specific about it. But there will be opportunities to simplify this business from a multidivisional business now to a single business called Bath & Body Works. And from that, there will be opportunities to offset some dissynergies with reductions in corporate and other overheads. Thank you."

In our own history, back in the great recession of 2009, we took our CapEx from $500 million or $600 million run rate, this is for the whole LB company, down to about $200 million in the span of about 12 months.
So if times get tough, we can hit the brake pretty hard. The profile for BBW will be lower, obviously, than the LB total. That's why you're asking about it. And again, ballpark number, $300 million to $350 million would be a good starting assumption."

With respect to free cash flow, we've got more work to do, obviously, on the capital structure of the Bath & Body Works business, which we've mentioned. And I don't want to kind of shorthand that and give pieces of it without providing the whole picture. You know the profitability of the business. It was asked and answered about the CapEx, but we're doing more work on it.
And in terms of the overall cash flow characteristics of Bath & Body, they're terrific, obviously, by the way. But in terms of a full assessment of it, which, ultimately, I think, we'll get to the question of dividend policy, you appreciate that, that should be done in a comprehensive way, which we will do. And when we're ready to talk about it, we'll talk about it. So that would be my views on BBW free cash flow. And we'll get to it as soon as we can, but we want to do it thoughtfully. And you can appreciate, hopefully, we've been busy with some other things.
And then thirdly, with respect to the mid-single-digit comp, getting to breakeven-ish -- or not a lot of growth, I should say, year-on-year growth, not breakeven, not a lot of year-on-year growth in operating income, Amie mentioned that it's a smaller quarter. And so as you think about leverage on fixed and variable costs, the result that you're asking about for Q1 doesn't translate through all the quarters just based on the relative size of the quarter.

The good news about Bath & Body Works is based on its merchandise offering and the nature of the experience with customers, Bath & Body is a destination, both in-malls and off-malls, but the conversion rates are very high off-mall.
And lastly, occupancy costs as a percent of sales are lower off-mall than they are in enclosed shopping malls. So the off-mall format is very strong financially. But again, both types of store, if you will, are doing well, good growth, good profitability. The off-mall opportunity is a big one. And as you heard earlier, we're pursuing it aggressively.
As a general matter, our lease terms are 10-year leases. As you know, we've talked about consistently in many of our stores based on -- these are in lower-tier malls. We have a lot of flexibility on month-to-month terms, and we get to that place just based on the strength of our business and the provisions in our leases related to occupancy levels and whether named tenants are doing business in those malls. So a lot of flexibility on -- in many situations. Generally, at 10-year lease terms. Thanks."

Could you step back a minute, are there any other areas besides leases of liabilities that stay with LB? Just in case we missed anything. And then maybe even bigger picture, how would you frame the downside that LB retains with this deal versus how much opportunity L Brands has to participate in the upside if the results do turn a corner? The obvious math, you keep 45% of the business, but do you participate linearly in the upside if the EBIT turns?"

So our downside is limited for reasons you would understand. We have the exposure related to lease liabilities that's been asked about, and again, on a gross or aggregate basis, around $400 million. There are provisions on how much debt can be put on the business that -- on the VS business that were negotiated and agreed. So we've got, I think, good protection there in terms of how that might be managed.
With respect to capital contribution requirements, there are essentially none of significance. And there's a lot of upside in just doing the math of what this business could be worth. If we all thought about what this business was worth 5 or 6 years ago, and the capital markets were ascribing no value to it, if not negative value to it. And so it was important to us to retain a stake in that potential value creation, and at 45%, that's a meaningful stake. So there is some downside. We've framed it or bracketed it for you. And there's a heck of a lot of upside that potentially could be very, very significant. If you just went back and did math off of what the business had done at its peak, if you even took half of that in terms of its potential, the upside is very significant. But at this time, we felt it was important to have the value of Bath & Body Works realized in the marketplace, to have new input and ownership perspective through a private format. And we believe that those results have the potential to deliver a lot of value to shareholders. Arguably, they already have delivered value to shareholders if one looks at the share price move between early January and what has happened since then. So that's how we thought about it. Thanks."

First, let me remind everyone that our first priority in any store reopening has been focused on the safety of our associates and our customers. I'd also say that while we made the incredibly difficult but appropriate decision to close all of our stores on March 17, we immediately did begin working on what would be required to reopen stores as quickly as possible and as safely as possible. And so we actually were able to have 2 pilot stores reopened here in the local Columbus market on April 3. So we have now over a month, 1.5 months of actual experience with these stores. Again, emphasizing safety has meant that our store operating model is almost completely different from what it was prior. What do I mean by that? We start each day by taking the temperature of all of our associates. We require that our associates were masks either that we provide or that they bring from home. We also ask that, in many cases, they were gloves. We provided individual aprons. We have moved away from shared shopping mesh bags to individual shopping bags, and we have practiced a significant amount of social distancing in the stores, which has meant that we have removed fixtures. We have marked stickers on the floor where customers should stand when they're in the store. We have significantly limited the number of customers that are allowed into any of our stores at 10% to 20% of the capacity of those stores depending on jurisdiction. We have reduced our hours of operation. And we are doing significant cleaning throughout the day as well as before and after openings, and we're doing that cleaning in a very visible way. Last but certainly not least, we've reduced the number of registers in stores and installed flexiglass barriers in between registers and in between the associate and the customer. And we are cleaning all of the surfaces that the customer would be in contact with after every interaction and transaction. So with all of that said, I would say we have been very encouraged by what we have seen qualitatively and quantitatively so far in those openings. Again, we have been, first and foremost, focused on safety, so we survey our associates every day to understand how comfortable are they with the work environment that we've provided. And we are also regularly surveying the customers through e-mails that have shopped in our stores. And we continue to get very high marks from both of those groups. On actual results standpoint, I should point out that we've been operating 2 different store model tests at this point. One, which is an open model, where we put in place all the safety measures that I just described. But we -- and the store is essentially open for business, but with a limited number of customers that are able to shop at any point in time. The other model that we've put in place is a call ahead or go online and buy ahead model, where we're not allowing open shopping in the store, but where transactions are placed by the customer ahead of time, and they come and pick up the order once they get an e-mail confirming that it's been fulfilled. That said, we have seen better success out of the first model, the social distancing model as we're calling it. And in terms of total results, again, I would caveat that this is a very small sample size. At the end of Q1, we had 23 stores reopened in the models that I've just described. But with those caveats, the performance that we've seen out of those open stores has been very similar to the type of trend we were seeing before we closed all the stores back on March 17. So encouraged by that performance. Your other question was around the performance of online and specifically online in the markets where we have reopened stores. So again, as you saw in our prepared remarks, our online business for the total quarter was very strong, with net sales up 85%. I think it's important to understand that within the time frame, the online channel started to perform significantly better than that total quarter of up 85 once the stores close. So for the fiscal month of February, the online channel was up 33%, which is very similar to the trend we had seen in 2019 and 2018. For the month of March, net sales were up 60%. And for the month of April, net sales were up over 150%. Again, so as stores closed, the online business saw a significant increase. And that increase, while driven by soaps and sanitizers at up over a 300% comp and more than doubling the rate of penetration to last year, we saw all of our other key categories also performing at levels significantly higher than what they had been performing at historically as well. So good business across all categories. And I believe your last question was around the stock-outs that we've been experiencing. I would say the good news is our supply chain has continued to perform very well through the crisis. With the notable exception, obviously, that the tremendous surge in demand in the sanitizer business has exceeded our supply chain in the early part of the first quarter. I would say, we have now successfully caught up with that demand. And so you should be now seeing online more consistent availability of our sanitizer product versus a month, 1.5 months ago, it might have been only available for a couple of days a week. And in our stores, as they reopened, we've been able to maintain our in stocks across all categories at this point."

My question is on inventory management. Can you talk a little bit about the process that you went through to reduce inventory receipts quite significantly for the first half?

So yes, you saw in our prepared remarks that at Bath & Body Works, we did reduce inventory receipts relatively meaningfully. But as I just described, the performance that we've seen in our direct channel is up dramatically. And so in some categories, soaps and sanitizers, specifically, we've actually had to significantly increase the amount of receipts that we would have expected versus last year because that category for the total first quarter, even with stores closed for half of the time, the soap and sanitizer business was actually up for the total quarter meaningfully. So we've increased receipts there. We have decreased receipts, as you would expect, in our other categories based on our current assumptions around store reopening cadence in the second quarter. But in the total level, we are very comfortable, not only with our total amount of inventory. But with the mix of inventory as we move into Q2 and then into Q3. I think it is important to remind everyone that, again, when the stores closed in the middle of March, the seasonal product that was available for sale at that point was early spring, in some cases, things like Easter product in our stores. And so as we do start to reopen the majority of our stores in the month of June and July, we will be opening in a semiannual sale type format, which, again, is similar to what we would be running normally in that time frame anyway. But in terms of your question, inventory levels and inventory mix at this point at Bath & Body Works, we feel very comfortable with."

With respect to Victoria's Secret, and we're referring to the business internally as VS New Co. Kimberly, what we are intensely focused on right now is strengthening the foundation of that business and even addressing the foundation of that business to manage through this crisis and to create a foundation for separation and for growth. And the elements of that work, I think you appreciate from our commentary that was provided, but I think it's important to review them because it provides very important context the essence of your question, which is what options will we look at and generally in what time frames for the separation of Victoria's Secret. So as you've read, as we announced last night, first and foremost, we're closing approximately 250 stores in North America over the next several months. That's a very significant decision, an appropriate decision and one that we think will strengthen the business. But the details of that, the implementation of that, the effect of that is significant. So rationalizing real estate, more to come after that, but 250 stores closing is a big deal, and we're initiating conversations with landlords with respect to that. So that's kind of a key piece of work. Secondly, we are engaged in a complete, comprehensive detailed review of our entire home office organization, really with the exception of Bath & Body, there's a little work happening there. But as you know, it's a well-running business and and it doesn't need much change. But with respect to Victoria's Secret New Co and all the shared functions, sourcing, production, technology, HR functions, finance functions, store design functions, real estate functions, the wide range of shared organizations today, we are embarking on a process to decentralize those functions to create 2 stand-alone companies. The amount of work involved in that -- and we're energized about the work, but the amount of work involved in that, and doing that in a way that strengthens the business, clarifies accountability, retains key talent, that's a very involved piece of work. And with that, is a substantial target for overhead dollar reduction, okay? And you will naturally ask, well, when will that be done? And we would expect that, that work will be largely concluded or concluded by the end of the second quarter, okay? So we're closing a bunch of stores, big deal. We're reorganizing, rationalizing, decentralizing, reducing overhead for a large home office workforce that's in process. Thirdly, we've got work to do, and it's underway to address the losses in -- both on an OI and EBITDA basis in the U.K. and China. And you'll ask about those in detail, and we won't be prepared to comment in detail about them other than we're looking at all options with respect to those geographies in those markets. And then lastly, there are 2 more things that we're working on is we've got to reopen all of our stores. So if you thought about selling a business literally in the moment where essentially all of your stores are closed and gave that serious thought for a minute. I know you're a serious person. You'd say, no, it's an interesting time to be actively marketing a business, right? So we would expect to have all the Victoria's stores certainly opened by the end of July. Our pace, we've got some range of pace in terms of the activity in June and July, but would expect to have the stores we aren't closing to be opened by the end of July. But as you again appreciate, there's a lot of work involved in that to do that in the ways that Andrew just described for Bath & Body, starting with safety of associates and customers. And then lastly, the management of inventory. So adjusting inventories and Alex's earlier question, adjusting inventories for Victoria's, there's been a ton of work done there internally. And with our sourcing partners, and we believe we've managed it well, but there's more to do there. And so all those things are in-flight to strengthen the foundation of Victoria's to allow the business to navigate appropriately through this unprecedented situation for retail and to then have a business that one could reasonably market for sale. So that's our thought process. The Board is heavily involved, as you would expect, led by now Sarah Nash, and they're getting regular updates as they should. And we'll consider a wide range of options for the business. But the ultimate goal here -- the goal, I won't say, ultimate, the goal is clear, 2 separate independent stand-alone companies. And having Bath & Body be a pure-play public company such that it gets appropriately valued in the market. It's a long answer, but it's a big question, and I hope responsive to what was on your mind."

So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business, both short-term and long term, I think as we always do, we first ask ourselves a question of are we in the right businesses and I think the very clear answer to that, that we're seeing is a strong yes. So again, in our hand soap and sanitizer business, which last year was about 14% of the business, with the crisis that's occurred and the focus on safety, that business is clearly an essential part of our customers' daily routine. And so we were already a market leader in that category before the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to grow our sales in soaps and sanitizers materially, even with the stores closed for half of the quarter. And so that is encouraging. And we're assuming, I think, appropriately that, that should continue to be a growth category for us as we look out into the foreseeable future. Also important to understand though that are other major categories of body care and home fragrance, we also believe are vital to her, not only here in the short-term but in the long term. Home fragrance, as everyone is spending more time out of necessity in their homes, the ability to turn your home into a sanctuary and to have it be reflective of your emotional state, it's something that we've heard qualitatively from our customers, and we have seen in terms of our results, both in stores prior to and after, prior to closure and after reopening as well as in our online channel. And then our body care business, with its emphasis on fragrances, lotions, Bath & Shower products, we believe continue to offer her a relatively inexpensive opportunity to pamper herself while she has isolated. And as we think long term, there's no reason why those categories and our emotional positioning around fragrance, our affordability that makes our products affordable enough for everyday use, while our quality and efficacy make them special enough to give us a gift we absolutely believe will continue to be a strong positioning opportunity for us to go forward. The other pieces, I think, are interesting."

And so I was going to add a little bit around what we are seeing from a customer standpoint. So obviously, with stores closed for half the quarter, store customers, we saw fewer of them than we did last year. But our direct business, as I mentioned, especially since stores closed has seen market growth and I think, in addition to just the number of customers that we've now seen online, one of the metrics we obviously look at is the combination of new-to-channel and new-to-brand because, as you can imagine, using direct is both an absolute customer acquisition vehicle as well as the ability to turn a customer from a single channel customer into a dual-channel customer drives overall value. And we have seen very exciting results on that front in the time frame that the stores have been closed."

In terms of how we think about it, as you appreciate in your question, first of all, it's complex and needs to be addressed thoughtfully. With that said, we're very comfortable that the amount of dissynergy with a couple of exceptions that I'll comment on, the amount of dissynergy between the 2 businesses is very manageable and shouldn't have a meaningful impact on either business' operating results. The 2 areas that will require the most thought are -- is technology, which, by its nature, is a significant function. And if one doesn't approach it thoughtfully in terms of a logical separation of the technology over a couple of year, maybe a 3-year period, one could incur cash and other costs in a way that's not necessary. So obviously, we expect to pursue a separation of the technology on the businesses on a thoughtful basis, and we would expect that we will have some sharing of technology for a 2- or 3-year period. Our systems aren't as integrated as some other retailers. It's important to know. Bath & Body's direct business, for example, is not riding on the same platforms that Victoria's business is riding on. And in fact, those activities today are outsourced. But technology would be one that deserves and will get appropriate thought as we separate these businesses. Maybe 2 others I'd comment on, the sourcing and production of beauty products. You know, Dana, that Victoria's Secret has a beauty business within it. It's a good business. It's a sizable business. And running with good numbers and shares organizationally resources and works with some of the same vendors -- many of the same vendors, I should say, as Bath & Body, but we believe that we can manage that well. And it's important to understand that scale economies aren't linear and straight. In fact, they're step functions. And one needs to very carefully understand how scale really works and where the steps really are in scale economies. And again, we think we can manage that area well. And then the last area that comes up a lot, which we believe is very addressable would relate to the movement of goods, the inbound movement of goods from basis supply is largely separate today as you understand the sourcing base. For Victoria's Secret is largely one that's international outside the United States, largely with the exception of Beauty, which I already commented on. And the sourcing base for Bath & Body is largely domestic, as you understand, in Personal Care and Beauty. So the inbound transportation as a general matter, there are a few exceptions, but as a general matter, is generally not shared. The distribution and logistics aspects of the business, there is a sharing there in some regards, but the distribution centers themselves are largely brand-specific. The outbound transportation from central points in largely in the Midwest and specifically in Columbus, that outbound transportation is shared, and we have some scale there, and we can retain that pretty easily. So with respect to movement of merchandise, again, relatively easy and being addressed. The overall point, Dana, I'd want to make is one of the perspectives coming out of the situation with Sycamore and part of the work in front of us over the next month to 45 days, is we're going to more aggressively and actively separate these businesses. We're going to use this time to do that, such that the ongoing support from L.B. or BBW remain co to VS Newco, the nature and the extent of that is substantially less than what was contemplated in the arrangements with Sycamore. And we think that will serve the business well. And more quickly and more appropriately separate the businesses. So part of that or work that I've mentioned is very much focused on a more accelerated decentralization of many of these functions. But again, technology, a little bit in the supply chain for Personal Care and Beauty, a little bit in distribution logistics, but we think we can manage through all that."

But there is an additional need to further rationalize the real estate in the business. In answer to your question, we see a pathway for a business that's, say, in the neighborhood of a $6 billion-ish business or a $5.5 billion business, one that mixes much more significantly to digital and one, obviously, that's substantially more profitable than the current or recent state of the business. So a big opportunity to have substantial growth in the digital channel. We're experiencing nice results here recently, but more strategically, big opportunity for growth with a good platform to start with. A rationalization of the store business, a big first step in this current year. But as you understand in your question, there is more to come. And what we see is a somewhat smaller but substantially more profitable business with a much better foundation and then obviously, a return to growth, which is what all of us are looking for, for our associates, for our customers, for shareholders. So that's the overall thought.

So again, the nature of your question was around are we seeing anything specifically right now that makes us think differently, either because of mix or other factors about what our longer-term profitability, operating margin structure should look like. And my short answer on that would be, no. Again, as a reminder, we have had a large direct business already. That direct business, as we've shared, historically, has performed at an operating margin very similar to our stores business. And while we are certainly seeing a significant shift to online here through the crisis time frame and would expect that some of that will be an ongoing shift for the long term. There's nothing inherent about that shift in mix that we believe would materially change the opportunity associated with our long-term operating margin structure as we move to 2021 and beyond."

I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something beyond that. So, Simeon, as you would expect and addressed earlier in the questions and through our commentary, we have taken very significant action on inventory. Very substantial, hopefully thoughtful, I think it is, but very substantial action on inventory. One of the challenges in the business over the last 2 or 3 years is that we have -- have had a view of revenue or sales that didn't materialize and have been challenged with promotion to clear goods with a softer revenue line. Said another way, we weren't buying as conservatively, certainly with the benefit of hindsight as we should have. As Ram Emanuel said, I think he said it others, I'm sure I've said it never waste a crisis. So as serious a matter as this has been for our country and for retail and for our company, I don't, in any way, mean to make light of it. But the clarity of the need to take action on inventory and overhead and real estate, we're really quite seriously approaching all those subjects. And with a very substantial reduction in receipts, I would expect that any phenomena that we might have experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, where we have found ourselves to be somewhat overbought in needing to drive promotion as a result of that, we're not going to be in that place this fall. Just to be clear, we will not be. The receipt reductions are very, very substantial. So that, along with honestly, John and Amie being in seat longer, they've got -- they've learned a lot, they're talented people. They're forming their teams. They've been in role longer. The combination of those 2 things and some early indications online, granted, got to be careful about interpreting online business right now. But I have lots of reasons to believe that the margin rate context should be substantially better for Victoria's as we move into the fall season and particularly in the fourth quarter for the business. With that said, as we open stores in Q2, and we're going to be in semiannual sale mode. And so there will be, in the second quarter, margin rate pressure, as you would understand, given where we are in the calendar and the need to clear goods in Q2. It's a long answer, but a lot of reasons to believe that we should be in a better place with respect to margin rates at Victoria's."

So again, in terms of our real estate strategy for 2020, hopefully, it's understandable that our decision to slow down dramatically the pace of activity this year was driven by the overall company's desire to be much more conservative in terms of capital spending during these unprecedented times, not driven by any change in our either performance of the stores that we've remodeled and opened or our belief in the long-term opportunity that those remodels do provide to the business. As a reminder, we finished last year with just under 50% of our total North American fleet having gone through a remodel. Even with the ramp down number of projects that we will go through this year, we'll finish the year with about 52% of the fleet remodeled. And we remain even in the period prior to store closure, we remain very pleased with the results that we're seeing from those stores. And so as I look out to next year and beyond, again, depending on the overall financial health of the business, our intent would be to get back to a significantly larger number of projects in the years ahead.

We know how to do debt financings, and I don't mean that in an arrogant way. It's -- but we're familiar with it. And the markets are open to people situated like we are, we're aware of that. And so we'll be looking at the merits of additional financings as we move on, and we recognize that today, though, those markets are available to us. And so will we make some use of the ABL as we move through the year? We expect to, based on the forecast that we have. And will we also give serious consideration to raising additional financing? We will, with obviously the right conversations with the Board and approvals from the Board. And again, the markets are open to us. And earnings calls are important things to use to update the markets. And so we'll see what our specific plans are here shortly, but there are plenty of bankers calling us, and we're familiar with doing financings and the markets are open.

So again, as I stated earlier, the #1 priority with how we're running the business overall, but especially as we progress with reopening stores is the safety of our associates and our customers, and that will obviously drive the pace at which we're able to reopen stores. That said, to your -- the first part of your question around what our current view of that cadence looks like, I can provide a little bit of color. So again, at the end of the first quarter, we had 23 stores reopened as part of the pilot. All of those stores were here in Ohio, and all of those were off-mall locations. As a reminder, about 45% of the Bath & Body Works overall North American fleet does exist in off-mall centers. As of this morning, we have progressed from that 23 stores that we had reopened at the end of April to now 66 stores reopened, and we now have stores operating across 8 different states. And we have, over the last week, actually reopened our first 2 mall locations. And again, important to say that our #1 priority as we do that, is looking at how are they operating from a safety standpoint for both our associates and our customers. At this point, we believe that barring any issues that would arise associated with that guiding principle, we should be able to ramp up the pace of our store reopenings here through the rest of May and into June. So that at this point, we believe we will have the majority of our stores reopened by the end of the quarter. That said, in the first quarter, roughly half -- the stores were open for roughly half of the quarter. Depending on the pace at which we're able to reopen here through the second quarter in June and July, specifically, some of which still depends on markets, large markets that are still close to us. For example, California, where we have over 150 stores at this point. The pace of that will determine how many stores we're able to have open for what amount of time. But our current models would assume more like 1/3 to 40% of total stores opened for the equivalent of the full quarter. If you will. Hopefully, that's helpful. In terms of performance, yes, you did hear me correctly. That, again, with all the caveats that need to go along with it, a very small sample size, again, only 23 stores that were open at the end of the quarter. Stores only open in off-mall locations, which means oftentimes there are other mall locations in that same trade area that are not open. But yes, the stores that have reopened have been performing in line with the comp trend that we saw before, we ended up having to close all stores on March 17. Hopefully, that's helpful."

And we have important relationships with our landlords and developer partners. But with that said, we've got some serious discussions to have. We -- our real estate function is led by an individual, Jamie Bersani, who is among the best in the business literally. And our business context is clear, which is we need to get relief in the form of rent reductions, rent abatements, other economic concessions. And Jamie will be appropriately working with our landlords and developers to achieve those results. And obviously, to the extent we can't make the unit economics work, then we have to close stores. And we're closing -- announcing a closure of 250 stores. So it's a complex, dynamic situation. But ultimately, it's got to make sense economically for us. And there's a lot of work to do, a lot of conversations to be had, and we'll take the appropriate actions. And this part of our business is led by Jamie and a team that are deeply experienced. They know what they're doing, and we're clear minded and aligned as a team about the situation that we're in at VS Newco. Andrew, you may want to comment a little -- the circumstances are a little different at Bath & Body. But as an overall point, Oliver, and hopefully I'm being clear, that's where we are. And it is dynamic. But I'm comforted by the fact that we're really clear as a team about what needs to happen, and we're well led. And we start with constructive relationships with our landlord partners."

I think, again, the 2 businesses are in a little bit of a different situation as it applies to the store strategy. And so while the guidance for Bath & Body Works does show a projection of closures, I believe, for the year of about 50 locations, that is more of a sense that, again, even though we are able to operate very effectively in off-mall locations, I think it's fair to assume that there will be some of the at-risk mall properties that may not come back to their pre-crisis levels of productivity. And so even though while Bath & Body Works has traditionally been very successful at performing in all venues, whether those are A malls, off-malls, outlet malls or even struggling malls, we are recognizing that, again, the solvents or viability of some of those locations may be less post crisis. And so that's what you see in our forecast. But we still remain committed. As I mentioned earlier, to that our real estate remodel strategy, which has been very successful for the past 5 years, is something that we intend to go forward with as we move through the rest of this year and into the years ahead."

And again, this is all about strengthening the foundation, having the right-sized store business, responding to the changing consumer behavior around digital and having a more balanced mix might end up being about 50-50 balance mix between the digital channel and our business and the store-related channel, and it will be a healthier business, a better business.

So clearly, as we've talked about and as you shine light on, there is a big opportunity with the sanitizer business. I think one point of clarity would be that the sanitizer business, as a portion of the total soaps and sanitizer business that I referenced earlier, which was -- that total was 14% of our business last year and is essentially doubling the sanitizer business is the much smaller portion of that at about 20% of that total. It has obviously grown dramatically since then to the point where what was roughly $100 million business last year, probably could be, as we look out to this year and beyond 2 to 3x of that size, go forward. So a meaningful business, but certainly not anything approaching the majority of our business. One of the ways we're looking to expand it is not only selling more of the business that we're in, which, for the most part, has been the small one ounce individual pocket backs, as we call them. But we're also here, as we move through the second quarter, ramping up the availability of additional sanitizer forms and sizes. And we do believe that, that portion of the business especially will continue to grow rapidly. As again, sanitizer is now something that will likely be part of all of our daily routines for the months and years ahead. So a meaningful opportunity."

I'd also say that while we made the incredibly difficult but appropriate decision to close all of our stores on March 17, we immediately did begin working on what would be required to reopen stores as quickly as possible and as safely as possible. And so we actually were able to have 2 pilot stores reopen here in the local Columbus market on April 3. So we have now over a month, 1.5 months of actual experience with these stores. 
Again, emphasizing safety has meant that our store operating model is almost completely different from what it was prior. What do I mean by that? We start each day by taking the temperature of all of our associates. We require that our associates wear masks either that we provide or that they bring from home. We also ask that, in many cases, they were gloves. We provided individual aprons. 
We have moved away from shared shopping mesh bags to individual shopping bags, and we have practiced a significant amount of social distancing in the stores, which has meant that we have removed fixtures. We have marked stickers on the floor where customers should stand when they're in the store. We have significantly limited the number of customers that are allowed into any of our stores at 10% to 20% of the capacity of those stores depending on jurisdiction. 
We have reduced our hours of operation. And we are doing significant cleaning throughout the day as well as before and after openings, and we're doing that cleaning in a very visible way. Last but certainly not least, we've reduced the number of registers in stores and installed plexiglass barriers in between registers and in between the associate and the customer. And we are cleaning all of the surfaces that the customer would be in contact with after every interaction and transaction. 
So with all of that said, I would say we have been very encouraged by what we have seen qualitatively and quantitatively so far in those openings. Again, we have been, first and foremost, focused on safety, so we survey our associates every day to understand how comfortable are they with the work environment that we've provided. And we are also regularly surveying the customers through e-mails that have shopped in our stores, and we continue to get very high marks from both of those groups. 
On actual results standpoint, I should point out that we've been operating 2 different store model tests at this point. One, which is an open model, where we put in place all the safety measures that I just described. But we -- and the store is essentially open for business, but with a limited number of customers that are able to shop at any point in time. The other model that we've put in place is a call ahead or go online and buy ahead model, where we're not allowing open shopping in the store, but where transactions are placed by the customer ahead of time and they come and pick up the order once they get an e-mail confirming that it's been fulfilled. 
That said, we have seen better success out of the first model, the social distancing model as we're calling it. And in terms of total results, again, I would caveat that this is a very small sample size. At the end of Q1, we had 23 stores reopened in the models that I've just described. But with those caveats, the performance that we've seen out of those open stores has been very similar to the type of trend we were seeing before we closed all the stores back on March 17. So encouraged by that performance. 
Your other question was around the performance of online and specifically online in the markets where we have reopened stores. So again, as you saw in our prepared remarks, our online business for the total quarter was very strong, with net sales up 85%. I think it's important to understand that within the time frame, the online channel started to perform significantly better than that total quarter of up 85% once the stores closed. So for the fiscal month of February, the online channel was up 33%, which is very similar to the trend we had seen in 2019 and 2018. For the month of March, net sales were up 60%. And for the month of April, net sales were up over 150%. Again, so as stores closed, the online business saw a significant increase. 
And that increase, while driven by soaps and sanitizers at up over a 300% comp and more than doubling the rate of penetration to last year, we saw all of our other key categories also performing at levels significantly higher than what they had been performing at historically as well. So good business across all categories. 
I believe your last question was around the stock-outs that we've been experiencing. I would say the good news is our supply chain has continued to perform very well through the crisis, with the notable exception, obviously, that the tremendous surge in demand in the sanitizer business has exceeded our supply chain in the early part of the first quarter. I would say, we have now successfully caught up with that demand. And so you should be now seeing online more consistent availability of our sanitizer product, versus a month, 1.5 months ago, it might have been only available for a couple of days a week. And in our stores, as they reopened, we've been able to maintain our in-stocks across all categories at this point."

So yes, you saw in our prepared remarks that at Bath & Body Works, we did reduce inventory receipts relatively meaningfully. But as I just described, the performance that we've seen in our direct channel is up dramatically. And so in some categories, soaps and sanitizers specifically, we've actually had to significantly increase the amount of receipts that we would have expected versus last year because that category for the total first quarter, even with stores closed for half of the time, the soap and sanitizer business was actually up for the total quarter meaningfully. So we've increased receipts there. 
We have decreased receipts, as you would expect, in our other categories based on our current assumptions around store reopening cadence in the second quarter. But in the total level, we are very comfortable, not only with our total amount of inventory, but with the mix of inventory as we move into Q2 and then into Q3. 
I think it is important to remind everyone that, again, when the stores closed in the middle of March, the seasonal product that was available for sale at that point was early spring, in some cases, things like Easter product in our stores. And so as we do start to reopen the majority of our stores in the month of June and July, we will be opening in a semiannual sale type format, which, again, is similar to what we would be running normally in that time frame anyway. But in terms of your question, inventory levels and inventory mix at this point at Bath & Body Works, we feel very comfortable with."

With respect to Victoria's Secret, and we're referring to the business internally as VS newco. Kimberly, what we are intensely focused on right now is strengthening the foundation of that business, and even addressing the foundation of that business to manage through this crisis and to create a foundation for separation and for growth. And the elements to that work, I think you appreciate from our commentary that was provided, but I think it's important to review them because it provides very important context to the essence of your question, which is what options will we look at and generally in what time frames for the separation of Victoria's Secret. 
So as you've read, as we announced last night, first and foremost, we're closing approximately 250 stores in North America over the next several months. That's a very significant decision, an appropriate decision and one that we think will strengthen the business. But the details of that, the implementation of that, the effect of that is significant. So rationalizing real estate, more to come after that. But 250 stores closing is a big deal, and we're initiating conversations with landlords with respect to that. So that's kind of a key piece of work. 
Secondly, we are engaged in a complete, comprehensive detailed review of our entire home office organization, really with the exception of Bath & Body, there's a little work happening there. But as you know, it's a well-running business and it doesn't need much change. But with respect to Victoria's Secret newco and all the shared functions -- sourcing, production, technology, HR functions, finance functions, store design functions, real estate functions, the wide range of shared organizations today, we are embarking on a process to decentralize those functions to create 2 stand-alone companies. 
The amount of work involved in that -- and we're energized about the work, but the amount of work involved in that and doing that in a way that strengthens the business, clarifies accountability, retains key talent, that's a very involved piece of work. And with that is a substantial target for overhead dollar reduction, okay? And you will naturally ask, well, when will that be done? And we would expect that, that work will be largely concluded or concluded by the end of the second quarter, okay? So we're closing a bunch of stores, big deal. We're reorganizing, rationalizing, decentralizing, reducing overhead for a large home office workforce, that's in process. 
Thirdly, we've got work to do, and it's underway to address the losses and -- both on an OI and EBITDA basis in the U.K. and China. And you'll ask about those in detail, and we won't be prepared to comment in detail about them other than we're looking at all options with respect to those geographies in those markets. 
And then lastly, there are 2 more things that we're working on, is we've got to reopen all of our stores. So if you thought about selling a business literally in the moment where essentially all of your stores are closed and gave that serious thought for a minute, I know you're a serious person, you'd say, it's an interesting time to be actively marketing a business, right? So we would expect to have all the Victoria's stores certainly opened by the end of July. Our pace, we've got some range of pace in terms of the activity in June and July, but would expect to have the stores we aren't closing to be opened by the end of July. But as you again appreciate, there's a lot of work involved in that to do that in the ways that Andrew just described for Bath & Body, starting with safety of associates and customers. 
And then lastly, the management of inventory. So adjusting inventories, in Alex's earlier question, adjusting inventories for Victoria's. There's been a ton of work done there internally. And with our sourcing partners, and we believe we've managed it well, but there's more to do there. And so all those things are in-flight to strengthen the foundation of Victoria's, to allow the business to navigate appropriately through this unprecedented situation for retail and to then have a business that one could reasonably market for sale. So that's our thought process. 
The Board is heavily involved, as you would expect, led by now Sarah Nash, and they're getting regular updates as they should. And we'll consider a wide range of options for the business. But the ultimate goal here -- the goal, I won't say, ultimate, the goal is clear, 2 separate independent stand-alone companies. And having Bath & Body be a pure-play public company such that it gets appropriately valued in the market. It's a long answer, but it's a big question, and I hope responsive to what was on your mind."

So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses",380,"Kimberly, thanks for the question. So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses. And I think the very clear answer to that, that we're seeing, is a strong yes. 
So again, in our hand soap and sanitizer business, which last year was about 14% of the business, with the crisis that's occurred and the focus on safety, that business is clearly an essential part of our customers' daily routine. And so we were already a market leader in that category before the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to grow our sales in soaps and sanitizers materially, even with the stores closed for half of the quarter, and so that is encouraging. And we're assuming, I think, appropriately that, that should continue to be a growth category for us as we look out into the foreseeable future. 
Also important to understand though that our other major categories of body care and home fragrance, we also believe are vital to her, not only here in the short-term but in the long term. Home fragrance, as everyone is spending more time out of necessity in their homes, the ability to turn your home into a sanctuary and to have it be reflective of your emotional state, it's something that we've heard qualitatively from our customers and we have seen in terms of our results, both in stores prior to and after -- prior to closure and after reopening as well as in our online channel. 
And then our body care business, with its emphasis on fragrances, lotions, bath and shower products, we believe continues to offer her a relatively inexpensive opportunity to pamper herself while she is isolated. And as we think long term, there's no reason why those categories and our emotional positioning around fragrance, our affordability that makes our products affordable enough for everyday use, while our quality and efficacy make them special enough to give as a gift, we absolutely believe will continue to be a strong positioning opportunity for us to go forward. The other pieces, I think, are interesting..."

So obviously, with stores closed for half the quarter, store customers, we saw fewer of them than we did last year. But our direct business, as I mentioned, especially since stores closed, has seen market growth. 
And I think in addition to just the number of customers that we've now seen online, one of the metrics we obviously look at is the combination of new-to-channel and new-to-brand because, as you can imagine, using direct is both an absolute customer acquisition vehicle as well as the ability to turn a customer from a single channel customer into a dual-channel customer drives overall value. And we have seen very exciting results on that front in the time frame that the stores have been closed."

In terms of how we think about it, as you appreciate in your question, first of all, it's complex and needs to be addressed thoughtfully. With that said, we're very comfortable that the amount of dissynergy -- with a couple of exceptions that I'll comment on, the amount of dissynergy between the 2 businesses is very manageable and shouldn't have a meaningful impact on either business' operating results. 
The 2 areas that will require the most thought are -- is technology, which by its nature is a significant function. And if one doesn't approach it thoughtfully in terms of a logical separation of the technology over a couple of year, maybe a 3-year period, one could incur cash and other costs in a way that's not necessary. So obviously, we expect to pursue a separation of the technology on the businesses on a thoughtful basis, and we would expect that we will have some sharing of technology for a 2- or 3-year period. 
Our systems aren't as integrated as some other retailers, it's important to know. Bath & Body's direct business, for example, is not riding on the same platforms that Victoria's business is riding on. And in fact, those activities today are outsourced. But technology would be one that deserves and will get appropriate thought as we separate these businesses. 
Maybe 2 others I'd comment on, the sourcing and production of beauty products. You know, Dana, that Victoria's Secret has a beauty business within it. It's a good business. It's a sizable business and running with good numbers, and shares organizationally resources and works with some of the same vendors -- many of the same vendors, I should say, as Bath & Body, but we believe that we can manage that well. And it's important to understand that scale economies aren't linear and straight. In fact, they're step functions. And one needs to very carefully understand how scale really works and where the steps really are in scale economies. And again, we think we can manage that area well. 
And then the last area that comes up a lot, which we believe is very addressable, would relate to the movement of goods, the inbound movement of goods from base of supply is largely separate today. As you understand, the sourcing base for Victoria's Secret is largely one that's international outside the United States, largely with the exception of Beauty, which I already commented on. And the sourcing base for Bath & Body is largely domestic, as you understand, in personal care and beauty. So the inbound transportation as a general matter, there are a few exceptions. But as a general matter, is generally not shared. 
The distribution and logistics aspects of the business, there is a sharing there in some regards, but the distribution centers themselves are largely brand-specific. The outbound transportation from central points in -- largely in the Midwest and specifically in Columbus, that outbound transportation is shared, and we have some scale there and we can retain that pretty easily. So with respect to movement of merchandise, again, relatively easy and being addressed. 
The overall point, Dana, I'd want to make is one of the perspectives coming out of the situation with Sycamore and part of the work in front of us over the next month to 45 days, is we're going to more aggressively and actively separate these businesses. We're going to use this time to do that, such that the ongoing support from LB or BBW remainco to VS newco, the nature and the extent of that is substantially less than what was contemplated in the arrangements with Sycamore. And we think that will serve the business well and more quickly and more appropriately separate the businesses. So part of that org work that I've mentioned is very much focused on a more accelerated decentralization of many of these functions. But again, technology, a little bit in the supply chain for Personal Care and Beauty, a little bit in distribution logistics, but we think we can manage through all that."

There's -- in the spirit of strengthening the foundation of that business, you appreciate the effect of closing roundly 250 stores in North America. We think there will be more store rationalization over the next several years as well. And you'd reasonably ask the number of stores. Obviously, as you move out in time, you're less certain of that. But there is an additional need to further rationalize the real estate in the business. 
In answer to your question, we see a pathway for a business that's, say, in the neighborhood of a $6 billion-ish business or a $5.5 billion business, one that mixes much more significantly to digital and one, obviously, that's substantially more profitable than the current or recent state of the business. So a big opportunity to have substantial growth in the digital channel. We're experiencing nice results here recently, but more strategically, big opportunity for growth with a good platform to start with. A rationalization of the store business, a big first step in this current year, but as you understand in your question, there is more to come. And what we see is a somewhat smaller but substantially more profitable business with a much better foundation, and then obviously a return to growth, which is what all of us are looking for, for our associates, for our customers, for shareholders. So that's the overall thought.

Again, as a reminder, we have had a large direct business already. That direct business, as we've shared, historically, has performed at an operating margin very similar to our stores business. And while we are certainly seeing a significant shift to online here through the crisis time frame and would expect that some of that will be an ongoing shift for the long term.

I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something beyond that. So Simeon, as you would expect and addressed earlier in the questions and through our commentary, we have taken very significant action on inventory. Very substantial, hopefully thoughtful, I think it is, but very substantial action on inventory. 
One of the challenges in the business over the last 2 or 3 years is that we have had a view of revenue or sales that didn't materialize and have been challenged with promotion to clear goods with a softer revenue line. Said another way, we weren't buying as conservatively, certainly with the benefit of hindsight as we should have. As Rahm Emanuel said, I think he said it, others I'm sure have said it, never waste a crisis. 
So as serious a matter as this has been for our country and for retail and for our company, I don't, in any way, mean to make light of it. But the clarity of the need to take action on inventory and overhead and real estate, we're really quite seriously approaching all those subjects. And with a very substantial reduction in receipts, I would expect that any phenomena that we might have experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, where we have found ourselves to be somewhat overbought and in needing to drive promotion as a result of that, we're not going to be in that place this fall. Just to be clear, we will not be. The receipt reductions are very, very substantial. 
So that, along with, honestly, John and Amy being in seat longer, they've got -- they've learned a lot. They're talented people. They're forming their teams. They've been in role longer. The combination of those 2 things and some early indications online -- granted, got to be careful about interpreting online business right now, but I have lots of reasons to believe that the margin rate context should be substantially better for Victoria's as we move into the fall season and particularly in the fourth quarter for the business. 
With that said, as we open stores in Q2, we're going to be in semiannual sale mode. And so there will be, in the second quarter, margin rate pressure, as you would understand, given where we are in the calendar and the need to clear goods in Q2. It's a long answer, but a lot of reasons to believe that we should be in a better place with respect to margin rates at Victoria's."

So again, in terms of our real estate strategy for 2020, hopefully, it's understandable that our decision to slow down dramatically the pace of activity this year was driven by the overall company's desire to be much more conservative in terms of capital spending during these unprecedented times, not driven by any change in our either performance of the stores that we've remodeled and opened or our belief in the long-term opportunity that those remodels do provide to the business. 
As a reminder, we finished last year with just under 50% of our total North American fleet having gone through a remodel. Even with the ramp down number of projects that we will go through this year, we'll finish the year with about 52% of the fleet remodeled. And we remain -- even in the period prior to store closure, we remain very pleased with the results that we're seeing from those stores. And so as I look out to next year and beyond, again, depending on the overall financial health of the business, our intent would be to get back to a significantly larger number of projects in the years ahead.

So our focus on it and actions taken to improve it, which have been outlined, have been very significant for all of the understandable reasons. And I would say generally consistent with actions taken by the industry, by the way. 
And so as you know, we converted the revolver to an ABL facility, and that's been disclosed and communicated. We have very conservative revenue projections for purposes of forecasting cash for the balance of the year. We will continue to consider raising additional financing as appropriate. We've done about 10 bond deals over the last 10 years. I checked with Tim Faber, who's our Treasurer and a terrific treasurer, by the way. We know how to do debt financings, and I don't mean that in an arrogant way. It's -- but we're familiar with it. And the markets are open to people situated like we are, we're aware of that. And so we'll be looking at the merits of additional financings as we move on. And we recognize that today, though, those markets are available to us. 
And so will we make some use of the ABL as we move through the year? We expect to, based on the forecast that we have. And will we also give serious consideration to raising additional financing? We will, with obviously the right conversations with the Board and approvals from the Board. And again, the markets are open to us. And earnings calls are important things to use to update the markets. And so we'll see what our specific plans are here shortly. But there are plenty of bankers calling us, and we're familiar with doing financings and the markets are open. So hopefully, that's a good sense of an answer there without being more specific."

So again, as I stated earlier, the #1 priority with how we're running the business overall, but especially as we progress with reopening stores, is the safety of our associates and our customers, and that will obviously drive the pace at which we're able to reopen stores. 
That said, to your -- the first part of your question around what our current view of that cadence looks like, I can provide a little bit of color. So again, at the end of the first quarter, we had 23 stores reopened as part of the pilot. All of those stores were here in Ohio, and all of those were off-mall locations. As a reminder, about 45% of the Bath & Body Works overall North American fleet does exist in off-mall centers. 
As of this morning, we have progressed from that 23 stores that we had reopened at the end of April to now 66 stores reopened, and we now have stores operating across 8 different states. And we have, over the last week, actually reopened our first 2 mall locations. And again, important to say that our #1 priority as we do that, is looking at how are they operating from a safety standpoint for both our associates and our customers. 
At this point, we believe that, barring any issues that would arise associated with that guiding principle, we should be able to ramp up the pace of our store reopenings here through the rest of May and into June. So that at this point, we believe we will have the majority of our stores reopened by the end of the quarter. 
That said, in the first quarter, roughly half of -- the stores were open for roughly half of the quarter. Depending on the pace at which we're able to reopen here through the second quarter in June and July specifically, some of which still depends on markets, large markets that are still close to us, for example, California, where we have over 150 stores at this point, the pace of that will determine how many stores we're able to have open for what amount of time. But our current models would assume more like 1/3 to 40% of total stores opened for the equivalent of the full quarter, if you will. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
In terms of performance, yes, you did hear me correctly. That, again, with all the caveats that need to go along with it, a very small sample size. Again, only 23 stores that were open at the end of the quarter. Stores only open in off-mall locations, which means oftentimes there are other mall locations in that same trade area that are not open. But yes, the stores that have reopened have been performing in line with the comp trend that we saw before we ended up having to close all stores on March 17. Hopefully, that's helpful."

And we have important relationships with our landlords and developer partners. But with that said, we've got some serious discussions to have. 
We -- our real estate function is led by an individual, Jamie Bersani, who is among the best in the business literally. And our business context is clear, which is we need to get relief in the form of rent reductions, rent abatements, other economic concessions. And Jamie will be appropriately working with our landlords and developers to achieve those results. And obviously, to the extent we can't make the unit economics work, then we have to close stores. And we're closing -- announcing a closure of 250 stores. 
So it's a complex, dynamic situation. But ultimately, it's got to make sense economically for us. And there's a lot of work to do, a lot of conversations to be had, and we'll take the appropriate actions. And this part of our business is led by Jamie and a team that are deeply experienced. They know what they're doing. And we're clear minded and aligned as a team about the situation that we're in at VS newco.

And so while the guidance for Bath & Body Works does show a projection of closures, I believe, for the year of about 50 locations, that is more of a sense that, again, even though we are able to operate very effectively in off-mall locations, I think it's fair to assume that there will be some of the at-risk mall properties that may not come back to their pre-crisis levels of productivity. 
And so even though while Bath & Body Works has traditionally been very successful at performing in all venues, whether those are A malls, off-malls, outlet malls or even struggling malls, we are recognizing that, again, the solvents or viability of some of those locations may be less post crisis. And so that's what you see in our forecast. But we still remain committed, as I mentioned earlier, to -- that our real estate remodel strategy, which has been very successful for the past 5 years, is something that we intend to go forward with as we move through the rest of this year and into the years ahead."

I think one point of clarity would be that the sanitizer business, as a portion of the total soaps and sanitizer business that I referenced earlier which was -- that total was 14% of our business last year and is essentially doubling the sanitizer business, is the much smaller portion of that at about 20% of that total. It has obviously grown dramatically since then to the point where what was roughly $100 million business last year, probably could be, as we look out to this year and beyond, 2 to 3x of that size go forward. So a meaningful business, but certainly not anything approaching the majority of our business. 
One of the ways we're looking to expand it is not only selling more of the business that we're in, which, for the most part, has been the small 1 ounce individual PocketBacs, as we call them. But we're also here, as we move through the second quarter, ramping up the availability of additional sanitizer forms and sizes.

But Carla, I'd be premature to get into the details of -- in the regard that you're asking about with respect to how we'll best affect a separation of the businesses. But I would take notice of the approach that we pursued. Because based on facts and circumstances then, obviously, we felt that, that was an appropriate approach. Obviously, that will all get reconsidered in a new context. The commitment is clear. But all that will get reconsidered with the right advice and, obviously, under the direction and approval of the Board. So I think it'd be premature, Carla, to get into those details. We'll work to be thoughtful about all of it, as you would expect."

I don't have all the answers right now. Again, as I've mentioned, our first and really primary and only priority is safety. And so in many cases, like on the use of sinks and like on the use of open product testing, we have paused their use here during the store reopening pilots.

First, let me remind everyone that our first priority in any store reopening has been focused on the safety of our associates and our customers. I'd also say that while we made the incredibly difficult but appropriate decision to close all of our stores on March 17, we immediately did begin working on what would be required to reopen stores as quickly as possible and as safely as possible. And so we actually were able to have 2 pilot stores reopen here in the local Columbus market on April 3. So we have now over a month, 1.5 months of actual experience with these stores. 
Again, emphasizing safety has meant that our store operating model is almost completely different from what it was prior. What do I mean by that? We start each day by taking the temperature of all of our associates. We require that our associates wear masks either that we provide or that they bring from home. We also ask that, in many cases, they were gloves. We provided individual aprons. 
We have moved away from shared shopping mesh bags to individual shopping bags, and we have practiced a significant amount of social distancing in the stores, which has meant that we have removed fixtures. We have marked stickers on the floor where customers should stand when they're in the store. We have significantly limited the number of customers that are allowed into any of our stores at 10% to 20% of the capacity of those stores depending on jurisdiction. 
We have reduced our hours of operation. And we are doing significant cleaning throughout the day as well as before and after openings, and we're doing that cleaning in a very visible way. Last but certainly not least, we've reduced the number of registers in stores and installed plexiglass barriers in between registers and in between the associate and the customer. And we are cleaning all of the surfaces that the customer would be in contact with after every interaction and transaction. 
So with all of that said, I would say we have been very encouraged by what we have seen qualitatively and quantitatively so far in those openings. Again, we have been, first and foremost, focused on safety, so we survey our associates every day to understand how comfortable are they with the work environment that we've provided. And we are also regularly surveying the customers through e-mails that have shopped in our stores, and we continue to get very high marks from both of those groups. 
On actual results standpoint, I should point out that we've been operating 2 different store model tests at this point. One, which is an open model, where we put in place all the safety measures that I just described. But we -- and the store is essentially open for business, but with a limited number of customers that are able to shop at any point in time. The other model that we've put in place is a call ahead or go online and buy ahead model, where we're not allowing open shopping in the store, but where transactions are placed by the customer ahead of time and they come and pick up the order once they get an e-mail confirming that it's been fulfilled. 
That said, we have seen better success out of the first model, the social distancing model as we're calling it. And in terms of total results, again, I would caveat that this is a very small sample size. At the end of Q1, we had 23 stores reopened in the models that I've just described. But with those caveats, the performance that we've seen out of those open stores has been very similar to the type of trend we were seeing before we closed all the stores back on March 17. So encouraged by that performance. 
Your other question was around the performance of online and specifically online in the markets where we have reopened stores. So again, as you saw in our prepared remarks, our online business for the total quarter was very strong, with net sales up 85%. I think it's important to understand that within the time frame, the online channel started to perform significantly better than that total quarter of up 85% once the stores closed. So for the fiscal month of February, the online channel was up 33%, which is very similar to the trend we had seen in 2019 and 2018. For the month of March, net sales were up 60%. And for the month of April, net sales were up over 150%. Again, so as stores closed, the online business saw a significant increase. 
And that increase, while driven by soaps and sanitizers at up over a 300% comp and more than doubling the rate of penetration to last year, we saw all of our other key categories also performing at levels significantly higher than what they had been performing at historically as well. So good business across all categories. 
I believe your last question was around the stock-outs that we've been experiencing. I would say the good news is our supply chain has continued to perform very well through the crisis, with the notable exception, obviously, that the tremendous surge in demand in the sanitizer business has exceeded our supply chain in the early part of the first quarter. I would say, we have now successfully caught up with that demand. And so you should be now seeing online more consistent availability of our sanitizer product, versus a month, 1.5 months ago, it might have been only available for a couple of days a week. And in our stores, as they reopened, we've been able to maintain our in-stocks across all categories at this point."

So yes, you saw in our prepared remarks that at Bath & Body Works, we did reduce inventory receipts relatively meaningfully. But as I just described, the performance that we've seen in our direct channel is up dramatically. And so in some categories, soaps and sanitizers specifically, we've actually had to significantly increase the amount of receipts that we would have expected versus last year because that category for the total first quarter, even with stores closed for half of the time, the soap and sanitizer business was actually up for the total quarter meaningfully. So we've increased receipts there. 
We have decreased receipts, as you would expect, in our other categories based on our current assumptions around store reopening cadence in the second quarter. But in the total level, we are very comfortable, not only with our total amount of inventory, but with the mix of inventory as we move into Q2 and then into Q3. 
I think it is important to remind everyone that, again, when the stores closed in the middle of March, the seasonal product that was available for sale at that point was early spring, in some cases, things like Easter product in our stores. And so as we do start to reopen the majority of our stores in the month of June and July, we will be opening in a semiannual sale type format, which, again, is similar to what we would be running normally in that time frame anyway. But in terms of your question, inventory levels and inventory mix at this point at Bath & Body Works, we feel very comfortable with."

With respect to Victoria's Secret, and we're referring to the business internally as VS newco. Kimberly, what we are intensely focused on right now is strengthening the foundation of that business, and even addressing the foundation of that business to manage through this crisis and to create a foundation for separation and for growth. And the elements to that work, I think you appreciate from our commentary that was provided, but I think it's important to review them because it provides very important context to the essence of your question, which is what options will we look at and generally in what time frames for the separation of Victoria's Secret. 
So as you've read, as we announced last night, first and foremost, we're closing approximately 250 stores in North America over the next several months. That's a very significant decision, an appropriate decision and one that we think will strengthen the business. But the details of that, the implementation of that, the effect of that is significant. So rationalizing real estate, more to come after that. But 250 stores closing is a big deal, and we're initiating conversations with landlords with respect to that. So that's kind of a key piece of work. 
Secondly, we are engaged in a complete, comprehensive detailed review of our entire home office organization, really with the exception of Bath & Body, there's a little work happening there. But as you know, it's a well-running business and it doesn't need much change. But with respect to Victoria's Secret newco and all the shared functions -- sourcing, production, technology, HR functions, finance functions, store design functions, real estate functions, the wide range of shared organizations today, we are embarking on a process to decentralize those functions to create 2 stand-alone companies. 
The amount of work involved in that -- and we're energized about the work, but the amount of work involved in that and doing that in a way that strengthens the business, clarifies accountability, retains key talent, that's a very involved piece of work. And with that is a substantial target for overhead dollar reduction, okay? And you will naturally ask, well, when will that be done? And we would expect that, that work will be largely concluded or concluded by the end of the second quarter, okay? So we're closing a bunch of stores, big deal. We're reorganizing, rationalizing, decentralizing, reducing overhead for a large home office workforce, that's in process. 
Thirdly, we've got work to do, and it's underway to address the losses and -- both on an OI and EBITDA basis in the U.K. and China. And you'll ask about those in detail, and we won't be prepared to comment in detail about them other than we're looking at all options with respect to those geographies in those markets. 
And then lastly, there are 2 more things that we're working on, is we've got to reopen all of our stores. So if you thought about selling a business literally in the moment where essentially all of your stores are closed and gave that serious thought for a minute, I know you're a serious person, you'd say, it's an interesting time to be actively marketing a business, right? So we would expect to have all the Victoria's stores certainly opened by the end of July. Our pace, we've got some range of pace in terms of the activity in June and July, but would expect to have the stores we aren't closing to be opened by the end of July. But as you again appreciate, there's a lot of work involved in that to do that in the ways that Andrew just described for Bath & Body, starting with safety of associates and customers. 
And then lastly, the management of inventory. So adjusting inventories, in Alex's earlier question, adjusting inventories for Victoria's. There's been a ton of work done there internally. And with our sourcing partners, and we believe we've managed it well, but there's more to do there. And so all those things are in-flight to strengthen the foundation of Victoria's, to allow the business to navigate appropriately through this unprecedented situation for retail and to then have a business that one could reasonably market for sale. So that's our thought process. 
The Board is heavily involved, as you would expect, led by now Sarah Nash, and they're getting regular updates as they should. And we'll consider a wide range of options for the business. But the ultimate goal here -- the goal, I won't say, ultimate, the goal is clear, 2 separate independent stand-alone companies. And having Bath & Body be a pure-play public company such that it gets appropriately valued in the market. It's a long answer, but it's a big question, and I hope responsive to what was on your mind."

So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses",380,"Kimberly, thanks for the question. So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses. And I think the very clear answer to that, that we're seeing, is a strong yes. 
So again, in our hand soap and sanitizer business, which last year was about 14% of the business, with the crisis that's occurred and the focus on safety, that business is clearly an essential part of our customers' daily routine. And so we were already a market leader in that category before the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to grow our sales in soaps and sanitizers materially, even with the stores closed for half of the quarter, and so that is encouraging. And we're assuming, I think, appropriately that, that should continue to be a growth category for us as we look out into the foreseeable future. 
Also important to understand though that our other major categories of body care and home fragrance, we also believe are vital to her, not only here in the short-term but in the long term. Home fragrance, as everyone is spending more time out of necessity in their homes, the ability to turn your home into a sanctuary and to have it be reflective of your emotional state, it's something that we've heard qualitatively from our customers and we have seen in terms of our results, both in stores prior to and after -- prior to closure and after reopening as well as in our online channel. 
And then our body care business, with its emphasis on fragrances, lotions, bath and shower products, we believe continues to offer her a relatively inexpensive opportunity to pamper herself while she is isolated. And as we think long term, there's no reason why those categories and our emotional positioning around fragrance, our affordability that makes our products affordable enough for everyday use, while our quality and efficacy make them special enough to give as a gift, we absolutely believe will continue to be a strong positioning opportunity for us to go forward. The other pieces, I think, are interesting..."

And so I was going to add a little bit around what we are seeing from a customer standpoint. So obviously, with stores closed for half the quarter, store customers, we saw fewer of them than we did last year. But our direct business, as I mentioned, especially since stores closed, has seen market growth. 
And I think in addition to just the number of customers that we've now seen online, one of the metrics we obviously look at is the combination of new-to-channel and new-to-brand because, as you can imagine, using direct is both an absolute customer acquisition vehicle as well as the ability to turn a customer from a single channel customer into a dual-channel customer drives overall value. And we have seen very exciting results on that front in the time frame that the stores have been closed."

In terms of how we think about it, as you appreciate in your question, first of all, it's complex and needs to be addressed thoughtfully. With that said, we're very comfortable that the amount of dissynergy -- with a couple of exceptions that I'll comment on, the amount of dissynergy between the 2 businesses is very manageable and shouldn't have a meaningful impact on either business' operating results. 
The 2 areas that will require the most thought are -- is technology, which by its nature is a significant function. And if one doesn't approach it thoughtfully in terms of a logical separation of the technology over a couple of year, maybe a 3-year period, one could incur cash and other costs in a way that's not necessary. So obviously, we expect to pursue a separation of the technology on the businesses on a thoughtful basis, and we would expect that we will have some sharing of technology for a 2- or 3-year period. 
Our systems aren't as integrated as some other retailers, it's important to know. Bath & Body's direct business, for example, is not riding on the same platforms that Victoria's business is riding on. And in fact, those activities today are outsourced. But technology would be one that deserves and will get appropriate thought as we separate these businesses. 
Maybe 2 others I'd comment on, the sourcing and production of beauty products. You know, Dana, that Victoria's Secret has a beauty business within it. It's a good business. It's a sizable business and running with good numbers, and shares organizationally resources and works with some of the same vendors -- many of the same vendors, I should say, as Bath & Body, but we believe that we can manage that well. And it's important to understand that scale economies aren't linear and straight. In fact, they're step functions. And one needs to very carefully understand how scale really works and where the steps really are in scale economies. And again, we think we can manage that area well. 
And then the last area that comes up a lot, which we believe is very addressable, would relate to the movement of goods, the inbound movement of goods from base of supply is largely separate today. As you understand, the sourcing base for Victoria's Secret is largely one that's international outside the United States, largely with the exception of Beauty, which I already commented on. And the sourcing base for Bath & Body is largely domestic, as you understand, in personal care and beauty. So the inbound transportation as a general matter, there are a few exceptions. But as a general matter, is generally not shared. 
The distribution and logistics aspects of the business, there is a sharing there in some regards, but the distribution centers themselves are largely brand-specific. The outbound transportation from central points in -- largely in the Midwest and specifically in Columbus, that outbound transportation is shared, and we have some scale there and we can retain that pretty easily. So with respect to movement of merchandise, again, relatively easy and being addressed. 
The overall point, Dana, I'd want to make is one of the perspectives coming out of the situation with Sycamore and part of the work in front of us over the next month to 45 days, is we're going to more aggressively and actively separate these businesses. We're going to use this time to do that, such that the ongoing support from LB or BBW remainco to VS newco, the nature and the extent of that is substantially less than what was contemplated in the arrangements with Sycamore. And we think that will serve the business well and more quickly and more appropriately separate the businesses. So part of that org work that I've mentioned is very much focused on a more accelerated decentralization of many of these functions. But again, technology, a little bit in the supply chain for Personal Care and Beauty, a little bit in distribution logistics, but we think we can manage through all that."

There's -- in the spirit of strengthening the foundation of that business, you appreciate the effect of closing roundly 250 stores in North America. We think there will be more store rationalization over the next several years as well. And you'd reasonably ask the number of stores. Obviously, as you move out in time, you're less certain of that. But there is an additional need to further rationalize the real estate in the business. 
In answer to your question, we see a pathway for a business that's, say, in the neighborhood of a $6 billion-ish business or a $5.5 billion business, one that mixes much more significantly to digital and one, obviously, that's substantially more profitable than the current or recent state of the business. So a big opportunity to have substantial growth in the digital channel. We're experiencing nice results here recently, but more strategically, big opportunity for growth with a good platform to start with. A rationalization of the store business, a big first step in this current year, but as you understand in your question, there is more to come. And what we see is a somewhat smaller but substantially more profitable business with a much better foundation, and then obviously a return to growth, which is what all of us are looking for, for our associates, for our customers, for shareholders. So that's the overall thought.

So again, the nature of your question was around are we seeing anything specifically right now that makes us think differently, either because of mix or other factors about what our longer-term profitability, operating margin structure should look like, and my short answer on that would be no. 
Again, as a reminder, we have had a large direct business already. That direct business, as we've shared, historically, has performed at an operating margin very similar to our stores business. And while we are certainly seeing a significant shift to online here through the crisis time frame and would expect that some of that will be an ongoing shift for the long term. There's nothing inherent about that shift in mix that we believe would materially change the opportunity associated with our long-term operating margin structure as we move to 2021 and beyond."

I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something beyond that. So Simeon, as you would expect and addressed earlier in the questions and through our commentary, we have taken very significant action on inventory. Very substantial, hopefully thoughtful, I think it is, but very substantial action on inventory. 
One of the challenges in the business over the last 2 or 3 years is that we have had a view of revenue or sales that didn't materialize and have been challenged with promotion to clear goods with a softer revenue line. Said another way, we weren't buying as conservatively, certainly with the benefit of hindsight as we should have. As Rahm Emanuel said, I think he said it, others I'm sure have said it, never waste a crisis. 
So as serious a matter as this has been for our country and for retail and for our company, I don't, in any way, mean to make light of it. But the clarity of the need to take action on inventory and overhead and real estate, we're really quite seriously approaching all those subjects. And with a very substantial reduction in receipts, I would expect that any phenomena that we might have experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, where we have found ourselves to be somewhat overbought and in needing to drive promotion as a result of that, we're not going to be in that place this fall. Just to be clear, we will not be. The receipt reductions are very, very substantial. 
So that, along with, honestly, John and Amy being in seat longer, they've got -- they've learned a lot. They're talented people. They're forming their teams. They've been in role longer. The combination of those 2 things and some early indications online -- granted, got to be careful about interpreting online business right now, but I have lots of reasons to believe that the margin rate context should be substantially better for Victoria's as we move into the fall season and particularly in the fourth quarter for the business. 
With that said, as we open stores in Q2, we're going to be in semiannual sale mode. And so there will be, in the second quarter, margin rate pressure, as you would understand, given where we are in the calendar and the need to clear goods in Q2. It's a long answer, but a lot of reasons to believe that we should be in a better place with respect to margin rates at Victoria's."

So again, in terms of our real estate strategy for 2020, hopefully, it's understandable that our decision to slow down dramatically the pace of activity this year was driven by the overall company's desire to be much more conservative in terms of capital spending during these unprecedented times, not driven by any change in our either performance of the stores that we've remodeled and opened or our belief in the long-term opportunity that those remodels do provide to the business. 
As a reminder, we finished last year with just under 50% of our total North American fleet having gone through a remodel. Even with the ramp down number of projects that we will go through this year, we'll finish the year with about 52% of the fleet remodeled. And we remain -- even in the period prior to store closure, we remain very pleased with the results that we're seeing from those stores. And so as I look out to next year and beyond, again, depending on the overall financial health of the business, our intent would be to get back to a significantly larger number of projects in the years ahead.

And so as you know, we converted the revolver to an ABL facility, and that's been disclosed and communicated. We have very conservative revenue projections for purposes of forecasting cash for the balance of the year. We will continue to consider raising additional financing as appropriate.

We know how to do debt financings, and I don't mean that in an arrogant way. It's -- but we're familiar with it. And the markets are open to people situated like we are, we're aware of that. And so we'll be looking at the merits of additional financings as we move on. And we recognize that today, though, those markets are available to us. 
And so will we make some use of the ABL as we move through the year? We expect to, based on the forecast that we have. And will we also give serious consideration to raising additional financing? We will, with obviously the right conversations with the Board and approvals from the Board. And again, the markets are open to us. And earnings calls are important things to use to update the markets. And so we'll see what our specific plans are here shortly.

As of this morning, we have progressed from that 23 stores that we had reopened at the end of April to now 66 stores reopened, and we now have stores operating across 8 different states. And we have, over the last week, actually reopened our first 2 mall locations. And again, important to say that our #1 priority as we do that, is looking at how are they operating from a safety standpoint for both our associates and our customers. 
At this point, we believe that, barring any issues that would arise associated with that guiding principle, we should be able to ramp up the pace of our store reopenings here through the rest of May and into June. So that at this point, we believe we will have the majority of our stores reopened by the end of the quarter. 
That said, in the first quarter, roughly half of -- the stores were open for roughly half of the quarter. Depending on the pace at which we're able to reopen here through the second quarter in June and July specifically, some of which still depends on markets, large markets that are still close to us, for example, California, where we have over 150 stores at this point, the pace of that will determine how many stores we're able to have open for what amount of time. But our current models would assume more like 1/3 to 40% of total stores opened for the equivalent of the full quarter, if you will. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
In terms of performance, yes, you did hear me correctly. That, again, with all the caveats that need to go along with it, a very small sample size. Again, only 23 stores that were open at the end of the quarter. Stores only open in off-mall locations, which means oftentimes there are other mall locations in that same trade area that are not open. But yes, the stores that have reopened have been performing in line with the comp trend that we saw before we ended up having to close all stores on March 17. Hopefully, that's helpful."

And we have important relationships with our landlords and developer partners. But with that said, we've got some serious discussions to have. 
We -- our real estate function is led by an individual, Jamie Bersani, who is among the best in the business literally. And our business context is clear, which is we need to get relief in the form of rent reductions, rent abatements, other economic concessions. And Jamie will be appropriately working with our landlords and developers to achieve those results. And obviously, to the extent we can't make the unit economics work, then we have to close stores. And we're closing -- announcing a closure of 250 stores. 
So it's a complex, dynamic situation. But ultimately, it's got to make sense economically for us. And there's a lot of work to do, a lot of conversations to be had, and we'll take the appropriate actions. And this part of our business is led by Jamie and a team that are deeply experienced. They know what they're doing. And we're clear minded and aligned as a team about the situation that we're in at VS newco. 
Andrew, you may want to comment a little -- the circumstances are a little different at Bath & Body. But as an overall point, Oliver, and hopefully I'm being clear, that's where we are. And it is dynamic, but I'm comforted by the fact that we're really clear as a team about what needs to happen, and we're well led. And we start with constructive relationships with our landlord partners."

I think, again, the 2 businesses are in a little bit of a different situation as it applies to the store strategy. And so while the guidance for Bath & Body Works does show a projection of closures, I believe, for the year of about 50 locations, that is more of a sense that, again, even though we are able to operate very effectively in off-mall locations, I think it's fair to assume that there will be some of the at-risk mall properties that may not come back to their pre-crisis levels of productivity. 
And so even though while Bath & Body Works has traditionally been very successful at performing in all venues, whether those are A malls, off-malls, outlet malls or even struggling malls, we are recognizing that, again, the solvents or viability of some of those locations may be less post crisis. And so that's what you see in our forecast. But we still remain committed, as I mentioned earlier, to -- that our real estate remodel strategy, which has been very successful for the past 5 years, is something that we intend to go forward with as we move through the rest of this year and into the years ahead."

And for Andrew, I congratulate you on your business trends. And as you think about the antibac business, I am just wondering about the opportunity you see to grow that business and that category, which now represents maybe 14%, 15% of sales. Could it become a substantially larger part of the business? And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you can further expand that opportunity."

So clearly, as we've talked about and as you shine light on, there is a big opportunity with the sanitizer business. I think one point of clarity would be that the sanitizer business, as a portion of the total soaps and sanitizer business that I referenced earlier which was -- that total was 14% of our business last year and is essentially doubling the sanitizer business, is the much smaller portion of that at about 20% of that total. It has obviously grown dramatically since then to the point where what was roughly $100 million business last year, probably could be, as we look out to this year and beyond, 2 to 3x of that size go forward. So a meaningful business, but certainly not anything approaching the majority of our business. 
One of the ways we're looking to expand it is not only selling more of the business that we're in, which, for the most part, has been the small 1 ounce individual PocketBacs, as we call them. But we're also here, as we move through the second quarter, ramping up the availability of additional sanitizer forms and sizes. And we do believe that, that portion of the business especially will continue to grow rapidly. As again, sanitizer is now something that will likely be part of all of our daily routines for the months and years ahead. So a meaningful opportunity."

First, let me remind everyone that our first priority in any store reopening has been focused on the safety of our associates and our customers. I'd also say that while we made the incredibly difficult but appropriate decision to close all of our stores on March 17, we immediately did begin working on what would be required to reopen stores as quickly as possible and as safely as possible. And so we actually were able to have 2 pilot stores reopen here in the local Columbus market on April 3. So we have now over a month, 1.5 months of actual experience with these stores. 
Again, emphasizing safety has meant that our store operating model is almost completely different from what it was prior. What do I mean by that? We start each day by taking the temperature of all of our associates. We require that our associates wear masks either that we provide or that they bring from home. We also ask that, in many cases, they were gloves. We provided individual aprons. 
We have moved away from shared shopping mesh bags to individual shopping bags, and we have practiced a significant amount of social distancing in the stores, which has meant that we have removed fixtures. We have marked stickers on the floor where customers should stand when they're in the store. We have significantly limited the number of customers that are allowed into any of our stores at 10% to 20% of the capacity of those stores depending on jurisdiction. 
We have reduced our hours of operation. And we are doing significant cleaning throughout the day as well as before and after openings, and we're doing that cleaning in a very visible way. Last but certainly not least, we've reduced the number of registers in stores and installed plexiglass barriers in between registers and in between the associate and the customer. And we are cleaning all of the surfaces that the customer would be in contact with after every interaction and transaction. 
So with all of that said, I would say we have been very encouraged by what we have seen qualitatively and quantitatively so far in those openings. Again, we have been, first and foremost, focused on safety, so we survey our associates every day to understand how comfortable are they with the work environment that we've provided. And we are also regularly surveying the customers through e-mails that have shopped in our stores, and we continue to get very high marks from both of those groups. 
On actual results standpoint, I should point out that we've been operating 2 different store model tests at this point. One, which is an open model, where we put in place all the safety measures that I just described. But we -- and the store is essentially open for business, but with a limited number of customers that are able to shop at any point in time. The other model that we've put in place is a call ahead or go online and buy ahead model, where we're not allowing open shopping in the store, but where transactions are placed by the customer ahead of time and they come and pick up the order once they get an e-mail confirming that it's been fulfilled. 
That said, we have seen better success out of the first model, the social distancing model as we're calling it. And in terms of total results, again, I would caveat that this is a very small sample size. At the end of Q1, we had 23 stores reopened in the models that I've just described. But with those caveats, the performance that we've seen out of those open stores has been very similar to the type of trend we were seeing before we closed all the stores back on March 17. So encouraged by that performance. 
Your other question was around the performance of online and specifically online in the markets where we have reopened stores. So again, as you saw in our prepared remarks, our online business for the total quarter was very strong, with net sales up 85%. I think it's important to understand that within the time frame, the online channel started to perform significantly better than that total quarter of up 85% once the stores closed. So for the fiscal month of February, the online channel was up 33%, which is very similar to the trend we had seen in 2019 and 2018. For the month of March, net sales were up 60%. And for the month of April, net sales were up over 150%. Again, so as stores closed, the online business saw a significant increase. 
And that increase, while driven by soaps and sanitizers at up over a 300% comp and more than doubling the rate of penetration to last year, we saw all of our other key categories also performing at levels significantly higher than what they had been performing at historically as well. So good business across all categories. 
I believe your last question was around the stock-outs that we've been experiencing. I would say the good news is our supply chain has continued to perform very well through the crisis, with the notable exception, obviously, that the tremendous surge in demand in the sanitizer business has exceeded our supply chain in the early part of the first quarter. I would say, we have now successfully caught up with that demand. And so you should be now seeing online more consistent availability of our sanitizer product, versus a month, 1.5 months ago, it might have been only available for a couple of days a week. And in our stores, as they reopened, we've been able to maintain our in-stocks across all categories at this point."

So yes, you saw in our prepared remarks that at Bath & Body Works, we did reduce inventory receipts relatively meaningfully. But as I just described, the performance that we've seen in our direct channel is up dramatically. And so in some categories, soaps and sanitizers specifically, we've actually had to significantly increase the amount of receipts that we would have expected versus last year because that category for the total first quarter, even with stores closed for half of the time, the soap and sanitizer business was actually up for the total quarter meaningfully. So we've increased receipts there. 
We have decreased receipts, as you would expect, in our other categories based on our current assumptions around store reopening cadence in the second quarter. But in the total level, we are very comfortable, not only with our total amount of inventory, but with the mix of inventory as we move into Q2 and then into Q3. 
I think it is important to remind everyone that, again, when the stores closed in the middle of March, the seasonal product that was available for sale at that point was early spring, in some cases, things like Easter product in our stores. And so as we do start to reopen the majority of our stores in the month of June and July, we will be opening in a semiannual sale type format, which, again, is similar to what we would be running normally in that time frame anyway. But in terms of your question, inventory levels and inventory mix at this point at Bath & Body Works, we feel very comfortable with."

With respect to Victoria's Secret, and we're referring to the business internally as VS newco. Kimberly, what we are intensely focused on right now is strengthening the foundation of that business, and even addressing the foundation of that business to manage through this crisis and to create a foundation for separation and for growth. And the elements to that work, I think you appreciate from our commentary that was provided, but I think it's important to review them because it provides very important context to the essence of your question, which is what options will we look at and generally in what time frames for the separation of Victoria's Secret. 
So as you've read, as we announced last night, first and foremost, we're closing approximately 250 stores in North America over the next several months. That's a very significant decision, an appropriate decision and one that we think will strengthen the business. But the details of that, the implementation of that, the effect of that is significant. So rationalizing real estate, more to come after that. But 250 stores closing is a big deal, and we're initiating conversations with landlords with respect to that. So that's kind of a key piece of work. 
Secondly, we are engaged in a complete, comprehensive detailed review of our entire home office organization, really with the exception of Bath & Body, there's a little work happening there. But as you know, it's a well-running business and it doesn't need much change. But with respect to Victoria's Secret newco and all the shared functions -- sourcing, production, technology, HR functions, finance functions, store design functions, real estate functions, the wide range of shared organizations today, we are embarking on a process to decentralize those functions to create 2 stand-alone companies. 
The amount of work involved in that -- and we're energized about the work, but the amount of work involved in that and doing that in a way that strengthens the business, clarifies accountability, retains key talent, that's a very involved piece of work. And with that is a substantial target for overhead dollar reduction, okay? And you will naturally ask, well, when will that be done? And we would expect that, that work will be largely concluded or concluded by the end of the second quarter, okay? So we're closing a bunch of stores, big deal. We're reorganizing, rationalizing, decentralizing, reducing overhead for a large home office workforce, that's in process. 
Thirdly, we've got work to do, and it's underway to address the losses and -- both on an OI and EBITDA basis in the U.K. and China. And you'll ask about those in detail, and we won't be prepared to comment in detail about them other than we're looking at all options with respect to those geographies in those markets. 
And then lastly, there are 2 more things that we're working on, is we've got to reopen all of our stores. So if you thought about selling a business literally in the moment where essentially all of your stores are closed and gave that serious thought for a minute, I know you're a serious person, you'd say, it's an interesting time to be actively marketing a business, right? So we would expect to have all the Victoria's stores certainly opened by the end of July. Our pace, we've got some range of pace in terms of the activity in June and July, but would expect to have the stores we aren't closing to be opened by the end of July. But as you again appreciate, there's a lot of work involved in that to do that in the ways that Andrew just described for Bath & Body, starting with safety of associates and customers. 
And then lastly, the management of inventory. So adjusting inventories, in Alex's earlier question, adjusting inventories for Victoria's. There's been a ton of work done there internally. And with our sourcing partners, and we believe we've managed it well, but there's more to do there. And so all those things are in-flight to strengthen the foundation of Victoria's, to allow the business to navigate appropriately through this unprecedented situation for retail and to then have a business that one could reasonably market for sale. So that's our thought process. 
The Board is heavily involved, as you would expect, led by now Sarah Nash, and they're getting regular updates as they should. And we'll consider a wide range of options for the business. But the ultimate goal here -- the goal, I won't say, ultimate, the goal is clear, 2 separate independent stand-alone companies. And having Bath & Body be a pure-play public company such that it gets appropriately valued in the market. It's a long answer, but it's a big question, and I hope responsive to what was on your mind."

So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses",380,"Kimberly, thanks for the question. So as we think about the crisis and what the impact will be to the Bath & Body Works business both short-term and long term, I think, as we always do, we first ask ourselves the question of are we in the right businesses. And I think the very clear answer to that, that we're seeing, is a strong yes. 
So again, in our hand soap and sanitizer business, which last year was about 14% of the business, with the crisis that's occurred and the focus on safety, that business is clearly an essential part of our customers' daily routine. And so we were already a market leader in that category before the crisis. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to grow our sales in soaps and sanitizers materially, even with the stores closed for half of the quarter, and so that is encouraging. And we're assuming, I think, appropriately that, that should continue to be a growth category for us as we look out into the foreseeable future. 
Also important to understand though that our other major categories of body care and home fragrance, we also believe are vital to her, not only here in the short-term but in the long term. Home fragrance, as everyone is spending more time out of necessity in their homes, the ability to turn your home into a sanctuary and to have it be reflective of your emotional state, it's something that we've heard qualitatively from our customers and we have seen in terms of our results, both in stores prior to and after -- prior to closure and after reopening as well as in our online channel. 
And then our body care business, with its emphasis on fragrances, lotions, bath and shower products, we believe continues to offer her a relatively inexpensive opportunity to pamper herself while she is isolated. And as we think long term, there's no reason why those categories and our emotional positioning around fragrance, our affordability that makes our products affordable enough for everyday use, while our quality and efficacy make them special enough to give as a gift, we absolutely believe will continue to be a strong positioning opportunity for us to go forward. The other pieces, I think, are interesting..."

And so I was going to add a little bit around what we are seeing from a customer standpoint. So obviously, with stores closed for half the quarter, store customers, we saw fewer of them than we did last year. But our direct business, as I mentioned, especially since stores closed, has seen market growth. 
And I think in addition to just the number of customers that we've now seen online, one of the metrics we obviously look at is the combination of new-to-channel and new-to-brand because, as you can imagine, using direct is both an absolute customer acquisition vehicle as well as the ability to turn a customer from a single channel customer into a dual-channel customer drives overall value. And we have seen very exciting results on that front in the time frame that the stores have been closed."

In terms of how we think about it, as you appreciate in your question, first of all, it's complex and needs to be addressed thoughtfully. With that said, we're very comfortable that the amount of dissynergy -- with a couple of exceptions that I'll comment on, the amount of dissynergy between the 2 businesses is very manageable and shouldn't have a meaningful impact on either business' operating results. 
The 2 areas that will require the most thought are -- is technology, which by its nature is a significant function. And if one doesn't approach it thoughtfully in terms of a logical separation of the technology over a couple of year, maybe a 3-year period, one could incur cash and other costs in a way that's not necessary. So obviously, we expect to pursue a separation of the technology on the businesses on a thoughtful basis, and we would expect that we will have some sharing of technology for a 2- or 3-year period. 
Our systems aren't as integrated as some other retailers, it's important to know. Bath & Body's direct business, for example, is not riding on the same platforms that Victoria's business is riding on. And in fact, those activities today are outsourced. But technology would be one that deserves and will get appropriate thought as we separate these businesses. 
Maybe 2 others I'd comment on, the sourcing and production of beauty products. You know, Dana, that Victoria's Secret has a beauty business within it. It's a good business. It's a sizable business and running with good numbers, and shares organizationally resources and works with some of the same vendors -- many of the same vendors, I should say, as Bath & Body, but we believe that we can manage that well. And it's important to understand that scale economies aren't linear and straight. In fact, they're step functions. And one needs to very carefully understand how scale really works and where the steps really are in scale economies. And again, we think we can manage that area well. 
And then the last area that comes up a lot, which we believe is very addressable, would relate to the movement of goods, the inbound movement of goods from base of supply is largely separate today. As you understand, the sourcing base for Victoria's Secret is largely one that's international outside the United States, largely with the exception of Beauty, which I already commented on. And the sourcing base for Bath & Body is largely domestic, as you understand, in personal care and beauty. So the inbound transportation as a general matter, there are a few exceptions. But as a general matter, is generally not shared. 
The distribution and logistics aspects of the business, there is a sharing there in some regards, but the distribution centers themselves are largely brand-specific. The outbound transportation from central points in -- largely in the Midwest and specifically in Columbus, that outbound transportation is shared, and we have some scale there and we can retain that pretty easily. So with respect to movement of merchandise, again, relatively easy and being addressed. 
The overall point, Dana, I'd want to make is one of the perspectives coming out of the situation with Sycamore and part of the work in front of us over the next month to 45 days, is we're going to more aggressively and actively separate these businesses. We're going to use this time to do that, such that the ongoing support from LB or BBW remainco to VS newco, the nature and the extent of that is substantially less than what was contemplated in the arrangements with Sycamore. And we think that will serve the business well and more quickly and more appropriately separate the businesses. So part of that org work that I've mentioned is very much focused on a more accelerated decentralization of many of these functions. But again, technology, a little bit in the supply chain for Personal Care and Beauty, a little bit in distribution logistics, but we think we can manage through all that."

But there is an additional need to further rationalize the real estate in the business. 
In answer to your question, we see a pathway for a business that's, say, in the neighborhood of a $6 billion-ish business or a $5.5 billion business, one that mixes much more significantly to digital and one, obviously, that's substantially more profitable than the current or recent state of the business. So a big opportunity to have substantial growth in the digital channel. We're experiencing nice results here recently, but more strategically, big opportunity for growth with a good platform to start with. A rationalization of the store business, a big first step in this current year, but as you understand in your question, there is more to come. And what we see is a somewhat smaller but substantially more profitable business with a much better foundation, and then obviously a return to growth, which is what all of us are looking for, for our associates, for our customers, for shareholders.

So again, the nature of your question was around are we seeing anything specifically right now that makes us think differently, either because of mix or other factors about what our longer-term profitability, operating margin structure should look like, and my short answer on that would be no. 
Again, as a reminder, we have had a large direct business already. That direct business, as we've shared, historically, has performed at an operating margin very similar to our stores business. And while we are certainly seeing a significant shift to online here through the crisis time frame and would expect that some of that will be an ongoing shift for the long term. There's nothing inherent about that shift in mix that we believe would materially change the opportunity associated with our long-term operating margin structure as we move to 2021 and beyond."

I just want to make sure I wasn't missing something beyond that. So Simeon, as you would expect and addressed earlier in the questions and through our commentary, we have taken very significant action on inventory. Very substantial, hopefully thoughtful, I think it is, but very substantial action on inventory. 
One of the challenges in the business over the last 2 or 3 years is that we have had a view of revenue or sales that didn't materialize and have been challenged with promotion to clear goods with a softer revenue line. Said another way, we weren't buying as conservatively, certainly with the benefit of hindsight as we should have. As Rahm Emanuel said, I think he said it, others I'm sure have said it, never waste a crisis. 
So as serious a matter as this has been for our country and for retail and for our company, I don't, in any way, mean to make light of it. But the clarity of the need to take action on inventory and overhead and real estate, we're really quite seriously approaching all those subjects. And with a very substantial reduction in receipts, I would expect that any phenomena that we might have experienced over the last 2 or 3 years, where we have found ourselves to be somewhat overbought and in needing to drive promotion as a result of that, we're not going to be in that place this fall. Just to be clear, we will not be. The receipt reductions are very, very substantial. 
So that, along with, honestly, John and Amy being in seat longer, they've got -- they've learned a lot. They're talented people. They're forming their teams. They've been in role longer. The combination of those 2 things and some early indications online -- granted, got to be careful about interpreting online business right now, but I have lots of reasons to believe that the margin rate context should be substantially better for Victoria's as we move into the fall season and particularly in the fourth quarter for the business. 
With that said, as we open stores in Q2, we're going to be in semiannual sale mode. And so there will be, in the second quarter, margin rate pressure, as you would understand, given where we are in the calendar and the need to clear goods in Q2. It's a long answer, but a lot of reasons to believe that we should be in a better place with respect to margin rates at Victoria's."

So again, in terms of our real estate strategy for 2020, hopefully, it's understandable that our decision to slow down dramatically the pace of activity this year was driven by the overall company's desire to be much more conservative in terms of capital spending during these unprecedented times, not driven by any change in our either performance of the stores that we've remodeled and opened or our belief in the long-term opportunity that those remodels do provide to the business. 
As a reminder, we finished last year with just under 50% of our total North American fleet having gone through a remodel. Even with the ramp down number of projects that we will go through this year, we'll finish the year with about 52% of the fleet remodeled. And we remain -- even in the period prior to store closure, we remain very pleased with the results that we're seeing from those stores. And so as I look out to next year and beyond, again, depending on the overall financial health of the business, our intent would be to get back to a significantly larger number of projects in the years ahead. Hopefully, that helps."

So our focus on it and actions taken to improve it, which have been outlined, have been very significant for all of the understandable reasons. And I would say generally consistent with actions taken by the industry, by the way. 
And so as you know, we converted the revolver to an ABL facility, and that's been disclosed and communicated. We have very conservative revenue projections for purposes of forecasting cash for the balance of the year. We will continue to consider raising additional financing as appropriate. We've done about 10 bond deals over the last 10 years. I checked with Tim Faber, who's our Treasurer and a terrific treasurer, by the way. We know how to do debt financings, and I don't mean that in an arrogant way. It's -- but we're familiar with it. And the markets are open to people situated like we are, we're aware of that. And so we'll be looking at the merits of additional financings as we move on. And we recognize that today, though, those markets are available to us. 
And so will we make some use of the ABL as we move through the year? We expect to, based on the forecast that we have. And will we also give serious consideration to raising additional financing? We will, with obviously the right conversations with the Board and approvals from the Board. And again, the markets are open to us. And earnings calls are important things to use to update the markets. And so we'll see what our specific plans are here shortly. But there are plenty of bankers calling us, and we're familiar with doing financings and the markets are open. So hopefully, that's a good sense of an answer there without being more specific."

So again, as I stated earlier, the #1 priority with how we're running the business overall, but especially as we progress with reopening stores, is the safety of our associates and our customers, and that will obviously drive the pace",486,"Thank you, Tiffany. So again, as I stated earlier, the #1 priority with how we're running the business overall, but especially as we progress with reopening stores, is the safety of our associates and our customers, and that will obviously drive the pace at which we're able to reopen stores. 
That said, to your -- the first part of your question around what our current view of that cadence looks like, I can provide a little bit of color. So again, at the end of the first quarter, we had 23 stores reopened as part of the pilot. All of those stores were here in Ohio, and all of those were off-mall locations. As a reminder, about 45% of the Bath & Body Works overall North American fleet does exist in off-mall centers. 
As of this morning, we have progressed from that 23 stores that we had reopened at the end of April to now 66 stores reopened, and we now have stores operating across 8 different states. And we have, over the last week, actually reopened our first 2 mall locations. And again, important to say that our #1 priority as we do that, is looking at how are they operating from a safety standpoint for both our associates and our customers. 
At this point, we believe that, barring any issues that would arise associated with that guiding principle, we should be able to ramp up the pace of our store reopenings here through the rest of May and into June. So that at this point, we believe we will have the majority of our stores reopened by the end of the quarter. 
That said, in the first quarter, roughly half of -- the stores were open for roughly half of the quarter. Depending on the pace at which we're able to reopen here through the second quarter in June and July specifically, some of which still depends on markets, large markets that are still close to us, for example, California, where we have over 150 stores at this point, the pace of that will determine how many stores we're able to have open for what amount of time. But our current models would assume more like 1/3 to 40% of total stores opened for the equivalent of the full quarter, if you will. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
In terms of performance, yes, you did hear me correctly. That, again, with all the caveats that need to go along with it, a very small sample size. Again, only 23 stores that were open at the end of the quarter. Stores only open in off-mall locations, which means oftentimes there are other mall locations in that same trade area that are not open. But yes, the stores that have reopened have been performing in line with the comp trend that we saw before we ended up having to close all stores on March 17. Hopefully, that's helpful."

And we have important relationships with our landlords and developer partners. But with that said, we've got some serious discussions to have. 
We -- our real estate function is led by an individual, Jamie Bersani, who is among the best in the business literally. And our business context is clear, which is we need to get relief in the form of rent reductions, rent abatements, other economic concessions. And Jamie will be appropriately working with our landlords and developers to achieve those results. And obviously, to the extent we can't make the unit economics work, then we have to close stores. And we're closing -- announcing a closure of 250 stores. 
So it's a complex, dynamic situation. But ultimately, it's got to make sense economically for us. And there's a lot of work to do, a lot of conversations to be had, and we'll take the appropriate actions. And this part of our business is led by Jamie and a team that are deeply experienced. They know what they're doing. And we're clear minded and aligned as a team about the situation that we're in at VS newco. 
Andrew, you may want to comment a little -- the circumstances are a little different at Bath & Body. But as an overall point, Oliver, and hopefully I'm being clear, that's where we are.

I think, again, the 2 businesses are in a little bit of a different situation as it applies to the store strategy. And so while the guidance for Bath & Body Works does show a projection of closures, I believe, for the year of about 50 locations, that is more of a sense that, again, even though we are able to operate very effectively in off-mall locations, I think it's fair to assume that there will be some of the at-risk mall properties that may not come back to their pre-crisis levels of productivity. 
And so even though while Bath & Body Works has traditionally been very successful at performing in all venues, whether those are A malls, off-malls, outlet malls or even struggling malls, we are recognizing that, again, the solvents or viability of some of those locations may be less post crisis. And so that's what you see in our forecast. But we still remain committed, as I mentioned earlier, to -- that our real estate remodel strategy, which has been very successful for the past 5 years, is something that we intend to go forward with as we move through the rest of this year and into the years ahead."

So clearly, as we've talked about and as you shine light on, there is a big opportunity with the sanitizer business. I think one point of clarity would be that the sanitizer business, as a portion of the total soaps and sanitizer business that I referenced earlier which was -- that total was 14% of our business last year and is essentially doubling the sanitizer business, is the much smaller portion of that at about 20% of that total. It has obviously grown dramatically since then to the point where what was roughly $100 million business last year, probably could be, as we look out to this year and beyond, 2 to 3x of that size go forward. So a meaningful business, but certainly not anything approaching the majority of our business. 
One of the ways we're looking to expand it is not only selling more of the business that we're in, which, for the most part, has been the small 1 ounce individual PocketBacs, as we call them. But we're also here, as we move through the second quarter, ramping up the availability of additional sanitizer forms and sizes.

But Carla, I'd be premature to get into the details of -- in the regard that you're asking about with respect to how we'll best affect a separation of the businesses. But I would take notice of the approach that we pursued. Because based on facts and circumstances then, obviously, we felt that, that was an appropriate approach. Obviously, that will all get reconsidered in a new context. The commitment is clear.

I don't have all the answers right now. Again, as I've mentioned, our first and really primary and only priority is safety.

The second quarter of 2020 continued to be an unprecedented time for the world, for the retail industry and for our business.

Additionally, we focused on our distribution, fulfillments and call center safety and maximizing our direct businesses. 
Overall, we delivered strong results in the second quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of all associates across our business: in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers call centers and home offices. On behalf of the company, I'd like to express our deep appreciation for all of their efforts. 
During the second quarter, we also took a number of important steps to prepare Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works to operate as stand-alone, separate companies, improve L Brands' profitability, maintain liquidity during the pandemic and maximize our financial performance, all of which we outlined in the earnings commentary that we released last night. As we also discussed in last night's commentary, despite our strong results in the second quarter, we do expect results to moderate.

First, as outlined in our circulated script in, as Andrew reminded us this morning, we took important steps to create or to facilitate stand-alone companies: Victoria Secrets and Bath & Body Works in the quarter. That was the organizational work that we did, taking many shared functions and creating -- or integrating those functions, I should say, into the respective businesses, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. We did retain Goldman and JPMorgan very recently shortly after the end of the quarter. And we'll begin work with them where they'll give the Board and the company advice about the range of alternatives and will assist us in a process as we move forward. Obviously, it's important to get a read on holiday results to value the business and to ensure that we strike the right balance in terms of timing, execution risk and getting an appropriate valuation for the business. And what the company is most focused on right now is driving great results at retail. So we got a lot of people in stores, distribution centers, home offices, vendor partners, all kinds of folks organized to provide the best results at retail. And I couldn't be more proud of what this team has done over the last 90 days or so through the organizational work, reopening stores, maximizing volume on the digital channel and the digital channel. So we're very focused on having the best holiday possible. It will be important as we go down this path. And it will be important to put as capital markets, advisers, potential buyers, again, the public markets assess the opportunity for Victoria's Secret. So very focused on having a good holiday, have hired some banks and took a lot of important steps to create stand-alone companies. Thanks, Ike."

And as we got more and more stores open through the end of the quarter, finishing with essentially the majority of stores open and sitting here now today, in mid-August, we actually have all but about 40 stores reopened. We've continued to see very strong results in both our direct channel and our store channel. And as we've moved into August, we've seen results continue to be very strong. In terms of your question around our future confidence in Bath & Body Works, I would say, there are also -- we have a lot of belief that our trend should be able to continue as a strong market leader in all of the categories in which we play. As you can imagine, as we've discussed in the past, one of the most critical questions we always ask ourselves is, are we, in fact, in the right categories of business? And are those categories that are still relevant to our customers and growing in the marketplace? And I think it's fair to say that in the case of Bath & Body Works, the answer to that question is a strong yes across our entire portfolio. Obviously, the soap and sanitizer business that historically has been 14% to 15% of the business is even more important to our customers and to all of the country right now in the midst of a pandemic. So as expected, we've seen tremendous growth coming out of that category. And while that may moderate over time, we expect that awareness around the importance of that category, washing your hands, using sanitizers when you're not able to wash your hands, will continue even as the pandemic itself hopefully starts to wane away. In terms of our other categories, we obviously have a huge and important body care business. That business has always been relevant to our customers, is even more relevant to her today as an affordable luxury, a way for her to treat herself even when she's unable or unwilling to spend money on perhaps other larger-ticket commodities. That is an inexpensive way, whether for self-indulgence or to give us a gift. And then similarly, our important home fragrance business that has grown substantially over the last half decade, also tremendously important to her, both now during the pandemic when we're using our homes as a place of work, a place of teaching in school and a place of refuge and solace. Certainly, making your home smell like you want it to is something that our customer has continued to express interest in. And again, something we would expect to continue through the pandemic and also afterwards. So again, bottom line, categories that we're in, very, very relevant today,, have been relevant in the past, and we absolutely believe are just as relevant to go forward. Hope that helps."

So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels, in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volumes really since the start of the pandemic. And what that has meant is that we have substantially ramped up our fulfillment center capacity even while needing to run those fulfillment centers in a way, as we mentioned earlier, very consistent with our overall focus on safety protocols. And as you might expect, that puts some constraints on throughput and other productivity measures in those centers as we have to apply social distancing and other parameters in those centers. That said, we are very pleased with the ramp-up in capacity that we have already achieved in both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. And as we move into the back half of the year where volumes continue to grow, we are also on track to increase capacity even further across both networks. So feeling like we're in good shape there. But obviously, anytime there's a concern around an outbreak, that's something we have to monitor and take appropriate actions. And so again, we are cautiously optimistic that we have procured and are using capacity wisely. When you think about our stores channel, in some ways, it's a similar constraint in terms of the number of customers that we're able to actually allow into the stores at any point in time in order to, again, be focused on safety as our key priority, as well as then our ability to  process customers through our cash registers and lines within stores. As we've reopened stores, we started off with I'm speaking now for Bath & Body Works, a store opening pilot in late April that put a significant constraints on the number of customers we were allowing into the store early in that process, early on, keeping it at about 10% to 20% of max occupancy. As we move through the second quarter, we got comfortable with our protocols, again, around safety, social distancing, consistent sanitizing of all the surfaces and products within the store on a regular basis. And that allowed us to get comfortable with raising that max occupancy up to about 30%. But that's still going to be an issue as we move into the height of holiday in terms of how many customers do we feel comfortable metering into the store at any point in time. Also in terms of a different cash-wrap layout, if you've spent time in our stores, either Victoria's Secret or Bath & Body Works, you'll see that in order to allow for social distancing by our associates, not all cash reps have been -- or not all cash registers on cash reps have been able to be utilized. That has caused us to look at more mobile POS cash reps in order to spread out customers and associates in the back of store to allow for that. So again, we're doing lots of additional testing here in the third quarter to simulate peak volume and understand how will that impact capacity and throughput. But those are really the reasons, Lorraine, for, again, the cautious  outlook as we move to volume levels in the fourth quarter that, I know, you know about our business are many times 2 to 3 to 4x higher than what we would normally see in the second quarter. In terms of incremental costs, as one would expect, putting in place safety parameters and personal protective equipment has certainly come with costs in our stores, and we are happy that we have made those investments and happy that we were able to procure all those supplies in a very efficient way, but that does come with additional costs. We're also seeing costs associated with what it takes to then run stores in this new operating model in terms of the level of labor in order to keep customers and associates safe in order to be able to guide customers through the store, in order to be doing the ongoing sanitation of the store and the product, as I mentioned earlier. So that all comes with additional costs. And then in other parts of the supply chain, whether it's in our fulfillment centers that we are, again, from a safety standpoint, operating differently, including, in some cases, paying premium pay in order to procure enough labor as well as, as we look upstream in terms of our in terms of our base of supply and in terms of our distribution and logistics network. We are seeing some inflationary pressure there on wages in order to procure enough labor. So that's at a high level, how I would describe both of those things. Stuart, I don't know if there's any other color you would add either from a VS or a total perspective."

So the store closure activity for Victoria's has been largely complete. Not fully complete, but largely complete. We remain comfortable with the estimate of about 250 stores closing this year in North America. The difference between largely and fully is we have some ongoing dialogue with landlords, property owners, developers on some of these situations. And so not all those -- not all 250 are fully resolved. But again, we remain comfortable with the estimate and an important decision for the business, as you appreciate. With respect to sales transfer, as you would also intuit or understand, there is a range of outcomes. We remain comfortable with the 30% to 40%. A portion of that -- at the minority portion, call it, 5%, and I'm generalizing, is going to the digital business, the balance going to nearby stores. As you would understand, the specifics vary by trade area. So a lot of this gets down to shopping patterns, traffic flows, et cetera, in trade areas. It's how we look at it. And lastly, Alex, you asked if the roundly 30% to 40% is generally consistent with our past history. And the short answer to that question is, yes, and so we've done more testing on this a year ago as we got somewhat more aggressive with closures last year, we learned more. We had experience prior to that. But again, what we're seeing is that 30% to 40% range, again, expecting that activity to be EBITDA and profit-neutral as we move through, and we think a healthy thing for the business. We all know what's going on in retailing generally. And for the VS Newco business, we believe this is an important step, a good step for the long-term health and profitability of the business. So that's where we're at."

So on your first question in terms of the capacity ramp-up, obviously, we are making any and all investments required in order to procure that capacity. That means working with more fulfillment centers than what we had at this time last year or even at the peak of holiday. We're already operating with more centers this year than last year by about 2x, and that magnitude will continue as we move through the rest of the year. In terms of the other investments being made into those centers, obviously, I described many of the investments associated with safety and making sure that we have adequate protocols, PPE equipment, as well as labor in those stores. Those are really the investments that we'll be making from a capacity standpoint. From a -- your question around the percent of sale for Bath & Body Works direct and other capabilities that we're looking to add to the direct business over time. I think it's important to just reground ourselves on where has Bath & Body Works online historically been as a percent of the total business. So it finished 2019 at just under 20% of total revenue for the Bath & Body Works segment, but had been growing rapidly over the past several years. Over the prior 5 years, compounded average growth rate in the high 20s and the prior 2 years, 2019 and 2018, growing at about 30% per year. So already a large and fast-growing portion of the business. That said, as you would have seen in our materials released last night for the spring season to date, the first 6 months of the year, Bath & Body Works Direct was about 42% of revenue, obviously, peaking in the time frame that stores were closed. But even as the majority of stores have reopened here through July and into August, the Direct business as a percent of sales has continued in the high 20s to 30% range, and that's frankly how we're modeling the business going forward. In terms of capability, you would have noticed that we have added the capability of buy online, pick-up in store, that is not something that the business had as a capability prior to second quarter of 2020. We have added that into, at this point, a little over 60 of our locations. 45 of those locations are specifically buy online, pick-up in store, curbside only. That was a model that we were fortunate to have available to us in California when some stores that had reopened were forced to close as a result of governmental and jurisdiction requirements in that state. So we have been able to continue to operate those stores and are pleased with the results we're seeing. Obviously, stores do more volume when they're fully open as opposed to curbside only. But it is a model that has allowed us to continue to serve our customers and associates safely in those environments. We do also have about a dozen locations where we have buy online, pick-up in store in addition to being fully open. And we are pleased with those results as well, and we're intrigued with how to roll that out more broadly as we move through the rest of the year. Again, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we do need to smooth volume out from our peaks in terms of peak days and peak time frames. And certainly, the buy online, pick-up in store option that allows the customer to lock in her sale, but then come and pick it up several days later, is a key part of the strategy to do that as we move into the back half. In terms of other capabilities, you've heard us talk about our loyalty pilot over the last couple of years. With the onset of the pandemic, we have not rolled that more broadly, but we continue to be intrigued and pleased with the results we're seeing there and do believe that we'll take that out more broadly as we move into fiscal 2020, '21. And  we're also looking at other, what I'll call, omnichannel capabilities to, again, more closely integrate our direct channel with our stores channel. And so certainly, all of the tremendous surge in business online has had us accelerate some of the projects that were maybe back-burner or further out to be faster, and we're intrigued by some of those opportunities as we move into next year. Nothing additional I would highlight, though, for balance of this year. Hopefully that helps."

So over the last several years, the inventory levels at Victoria's and the need to promote based on consumer response to what we were doing not being as strong as we would have hoped, has been high, meaning we've been somewhat overbought over the last 2 or 3 years. I'm speaking generally, it's varied some by line of business and by category. With that said, the pandemic actually creates a real opportunity for us in the positive sense to make substantial change in the profile of inventory purchases, which we've outlined. That, in combination with what we do believe is being closer to the customer and delivering better fashion and newness, better merchandising fundamentals around good, better, best, basics with Greg, Amie and John's leadership in those areas as the key merchant leaders in the business. The combination of those things gives us a real reason to believe, along with some focus on getting the cost balance in line that we've got a real opportunity to deliver good experiences to customers and substantially improve the profitability, the merchandise margin rates in the business. Obviously, being appropriately in stock for the customer in core categories and key sizes is a fundamental and something that needs to be, and we will remain very focused on delivering a good experience for her. So we understand the importance of that. We're managing that well. But really the need to fundamentally become much more conservative on the inventory buy or the purchases again, triggered by the pandemic, has a silver lining to it in that it provided a real clarity to the organization about buying much more conservatively and then chasing in the business when the trend was, in fact, there. So that's where we are. We understand that being in stock is important. But in terms of overall turn in the business, importantly. In certain categories, we were turning reasonably well or at a level that we're very comfortable with. And in other categories, we had meaningful opportunity to improve the turn in the business. And again, the combination of everything I've just described, I think, is going to get us to a much healthier balance between inventory levels and purchases and the underlying demand. So that's where we're at on. Thanks."

Again, because we don't know -- it's a very wide range of outcomes that are possible. And so we want to be able to absolutely chase to the upside if we're able to continue a trend more like what we've seen year-to-date, but also use our agility as we have historically, to also cut back if, in fact, things don't materialize to the level that we would expect them to. So as a reminder, the Bath & Body Works supply chain is almost, almost fully a domestic supply chain, and a lot of it is actually produced right here in Central Ohio. And so that gives us, again, tremendous flexibility and agility. And allows us to, as you mentioned, really chase into trends. So in our vernacular, maximize winners and minimize losers or things that end up performing worse than our expectations. The ability to do that has been a critical part of our historical success, and we're absolutely relying on it already through the first half of the year because we were surprised to the upside in the second quarter. And so Bath & Body Works had originally cut back pretty substantially on receipts at the beginning of the quarter, but we were able to successfully chase back into receipts through the quarter in order to meet our demand that exceeded our expectations, and we would expect to be able to use that same flexibility and agility in the back half. In terms of your question around gifting strategy and specific assembled gift sets versus more open stock gifting, again, I think it's important to remind everyone that Bath & Body Works is absolutely a gifting destination for customers year-round at any point in time. At the height of holiday, probably 50% to 60% of customers claim to be coming in for gifts, even the rest of the year, that number is in the 30% to 40% range. So year-round gifting is something that we focus on for sure at Bath & Body Works, and we see that as a successful driver of the business. As we move into this particular Christmas, I would say, based on several years of testing results around the pros and cons of having assembled gift sets that we certainly have moved over the last couple of years to having fewer, smaller portion of our business in those assembled gift sets. And later, meaning closer to Christmas as opposed to earlier in the holiday season, is when that business really peaks. And so we'll continue to rely on those learnings to impact our flow of assembled gifts in terms of amount and timing. But again, what that does have us focus on then is ensuring that the whole assortment that's available for customers inside of the holiday time frame is giftable and making that as easy as possible for her with things like cellophane wrap available for all customers, ribbons to create gifts. Our associates are happy to create those gifts for you in-store as well as provide you with supplies to do that from home. So gifting in general as much, if not more of a focus this year than it's ever been. Hope that's helpful."

And with the combination of actions that we're pursuing and that we've talked about, I see the opportunity for that stabilization and then for resuming to a pattern of growth, most importantly at retail in terms of top line and margin dollars, again, in combination with the cost-rationalization actions that we've pursued. Maybe lastly and a lot into the -- in my response, but it all is -- all these factors matter. Amie has done important work on the PINK brand positioning. John is doing important work on the Victoria's brand positioning. Some of the changes, one might argue have been settled so far, but we have indication that the consumer is noticing those changes and those are important changes, and there's more to come on both those things. So we got a lot in front of us. Again, we're not confused about where we are. You put that in combination and operating in an environment that's a pandemic, with the effect of closing stores and the earlier conversations around store capacity and so on at holiday. But feeling like the business is stabilizing and that we're creating the platform for growth. So that would be my perspective on Victoria's. Thanks."

In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores open. So again, to reiterate what those were, obvi",553,"Yes. So thank you, Omar. In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores open. So again, to reiterate what those were, obviously, when you have a very small number of stores open in the early part of the quarter, as a reminder, we -- for Bath & Body Works, started the quarter with only 23 stores reopened in North America. And we gradually increased that number about 50 a week through May, a couple of hundred a week through June and then down to about 100 a week through July to get to that essentially fully reopened as we sit here now in mid-August. But as you would expect, when very few stores were reopened and only a couple of stores in each market early in the quarter, we obviously saw a tremendously high comps out of those locations as they were drawing from a multiple store trade radius. Obviously, in our categories, too, which is a use-up category, where if you're loyal to our products, whether again that's soap or body care or home fragrance, you tend to, if you're using it every day, go through it in about 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the product category, which means as stores were closed, there was clearly some pent-up demand. And while some customers did move their purchasing online, many customers waited for our stores to reopen. And so we certainly felt some of that impact as we reopened. And then also, as mentioned, obviously, industry-wide, there's a tremendous demand for soap and sanitizers. And so we certainly felt the benefit of being a strong player in that category. All of that said, even as stores were opened for a longer period of time. So specifically, stores that opened late in Q1 or early in Q2, by the end of the second quarter, we were still seeing very strong double-digit comps out of those locations. And again, that's what we're looking at and again, building our upside views to assume that what would it take to maintain that kind of a trend while also managing to downsides, again, either based on capacity or if there were to be a change in momentum in the business. On your question regarding BOPIS, I think maybe it's -- or buy online, pickup in store. I think it's important to clarify that the capability that I described earlier was specific to Bath & Body Works. That's the only locations right now where we are utilizing that buy online, pickup in store capability. In terms of your question around what do those -- the profile of those transactions look like relative to a normal transaction. Again, when you're buying online, you're doing so through the website and then directing the purchase ultimately to be fulfilled in one of our stores. But the profile of those transactions look very similar to our other online transactions. Our online transactions tend to have a slightly average order -- higher, slightly average order size than our in-store transactions. But in terms of margin or category mix, very similar to a normal average transaction. So not something that we would think go forward drives material change. That's helpful."

But what percentage of last year's revenue can that low level of traffic capacity deliver in your stores? I would assume that it's materially better than that. But I just wanted to see if you could help us understand how the traffic capacity limits translate into store only revenues at this level."

So I'll try to directionally answer hopefully in a way that's helpful. So again, when more speaking in terms of metering traffic or number of customers in the store, the percent capacity that we're talking about there is generally a capacity that's given by local authorities around what would the fire marshal, for example, say, is a safe number of people to have in the store at any point in time. And we've pegged that 30% directionally number due to really looking at what does that allow for in terms of social distancing of associates and customers throughout the store. So obviously, in many days of the week and many times of the year, that's not a problem at all, meaning that even at a 30% capacity, we don't -- that doesn't create a line outside the store at all. But at other times a year, in the peak of holiday, that's obviously what we're looking at and trying to figure out. So in terms of that number itself, we certainly will be continuing to test and monitor that, again, the priority is safety. So we're not going to make any changes to that if we think that requires us to compromise on safety and social distancing. But certainly, we are continuing to monitor to see if that number is right. The other part of your question was around modeling, what does that allow us to do in terms of covering last year revenue. So obviously, in the second quarter, even with those parameters in place and even more stringent parameters in place earlier in the quarter, you saw that, obviously, there was no constraint in terms of our ability to maximize revenue in the stores. Traffic into our locations in second quarter was down. It was down in the high single-digit range. There was some differentiation of that traffic between mall stores and non-mall stores. It was down more in mall stores. It was actually up in non-mall stores driving performance differentiation between those locations. But the other parts of the selling equation were up dramatically. So conversion up in the 30% range and average dollar sale up in the 40% to 50% range, so way more than an offset, obviously, to that traffic decline. And we will be relying on those metrics to continue to drive performance as we move into the back half. The combination of those things obviously means that the dollar generated by every footsteps into our store is up dramatically, up basically double to last year, if that's helpful."

But similar to the U.S., the rest of world franchise partners are now largely reopened in terms of locations around the world. And also, we're able to very successfully shift business to online in all of their markets as well. So when we think about from a future potential opportunity, again, that franchise model, which is a low capital-light investment with a lot of potential upside is something that we absolutely do believe over the next several years, we will want to expand further into additional geographies.

First, as outlined in our circulated script in and as Andrew reminded us this morning, we took important steps to create or to facilitate stand-alone companies, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works in the quarter. That was the organizational work that we did, taking many shared functions and creating -- or integrating those functions, I should say, into the respective businesses, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. 
We did retain Goldman and JPMorgan very recently shortly after the end of the quarter. And we'll begin work with them where they'll give the Board and the company advice about the range of alternatives and will assist us in a process as we move forward. 
Obviously, it's important to get a read on holiday results to value the business and to ensure that we strike the right balance in terms of timing, execution risk and getting an appropriate valuation for the business. And what the company is most focused on right now is driving great results at retail. So we got a lot of people in stores, distribution centers, home offices, vendor partners, all kinds of folks organized to provide the best results at retail. And I couldn't be more proud of what this team has done over the last 90 days or so through the organizational work, reopening stores, maximizing volume on the digital channel and the digital channel. So we're very focused on having the best holiday possible. It will be important as we go down this path. And it will be important and put -- as capital markets, advisers, potential buyers, again, the public markets assess the opportunity for Victoria's Secret. So very focused on having a good holiday, have hired some banks and took a lot of important steps to create stand-alone companies. Thanks, Ike."

And as we got more and more stores open through the end of the quarter, finishing with essentially the majority of stores open and sitting here now today in mid-August, we actually have all but about 40 stores reopened. We've continued to see very strong results in both our direct channel and our stores channel. And as we've moved into August, we've seen results continue to be very strong. 
In terms of your question around our future confidence in Bath & Body Works, I would say there are also, we have a lot of belief that our trend should be able to continue as a strong market leader in all of the categories in which we play. As you can imagine, as we've discussed in the past, one of the most critical questions we always ask ourselves is, are we, in fact, in the right categories of business. And are those categories that are still relevant to our customers and growing in the marketplace? And I think it's fair to say that in the case of Bath & Body Works, the answer to that question is a strong yes across our entire portfolio. 
Obviously, the soap and sanitizer business that historically has been 14% to 15% of the business is even more important to our customers and to all of the country right now in the midst of a pandemic. So as expected, we've seen tremendous growth coming out of that category. And while that may moderate over time, we expect that awareness around the importance of that category, washing your hands, using sanitizers when you're not able to wash your hands, will continue even as the pandemic itself hopefully starts to wane away. 
In terms of our other categories, we obviously have a huge and important body care business. That business has always been relevant to our customers, is even more relevant to her today as an affordable luxury, a way for her to treat herself even when she's unable or unwilling to spend money on perhaps other larger-ticket commodities. That is an inexpensive way, whether for self-indulgence or to give as a gift. And then similarly, our important home fragrance business that has grown substantially over the last half decade, also tremendously important to her, both now during the pandemic when we're using our homes as a place of work, a place of teaching and school and a place of refuge and solace. Certainly, making your home smell like you want it to is something that our customer has continued to express interest in and again, something we would expect to continue through the pandemic and also afterwards. So again, bottom line, categories that we're in, very, very relevant today, have been relevant in the past, and we absolutely believe are just as relevant to go forward. Hope that helps."

So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volume",820,"Thanks, Lorraine. So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volumes really since the start of the pandemic. And what that has meant is that we have substantially ramped up our fulfillment center capacity even while needing to run those fulfillment centers in a way, as we mentioned earlier, very consistent with our overall focus on safety protocols. And as you might expect, that puts some constraints on throughput and other productivity measures in those centers as we have to apply social distancing and other parameters in those centers. 
That said, we are very pleased with the ramp-up in capacity that we have already achieved in both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. And as we move into the back half of the year where volumes continue to grow, we are also on track to increase capacity even further across both networks. So feeling like we're in good shape there. But obviously, anytime there's a concern around an outbreak, that's something we have to monitor and take appropriate actions. And so again, we are cautiously optimistic that we have procured and are using capacity wisely. 
When you think about our stores channel, in some ways, it's a similar constraint in terms of the number of customers that we're able to actually allow into the stores at any point in time in order to, again, be focused on safety as our key priority as well as then our ability to process customers through our cash registers and lines within stores. As we've reopened stores, we started off with -- I'm speaking now for Bath & Body Works, a store opening pilot in late April that put a significant constraint on the number of customers we were allowing into the store early in that process, early on, keeping it at about 10% to 20% of max occupancy. As we move through the second quarter, we got comfortable with our protocols, again, around safety, social distancing, consistent sanitizing of all the surfaces and products within the store on a regular basis. And that allowed us to get comfortable with raising that max occupancy up to about 30%. But that's still going to be an issue as we move into the height of holiday in terms of how many customers do we feel comfortable metering into the store at any point in time. 
Also, in terms of a different cash wrap layout, if you've spent time in our stores, either Victoria's Secret or Bath & Body Works, you'll see that in order to allow for social distancing by our associates, not all cash wraps have been -- or not all cash registers on cash wraps have been able to be utilized. That has caused us to look at more mobile POS cash wraps in order to spread out customers and associates in the back of store to allow for that. So again, we're doing lots of additional testing here in the third quarter to simulate peak volume and understand how will that impact capacity and throughput. But those are really the reasons, Lorraine, for again, the cautious outlook as we move to volume levels in the fourth quarter that, I know you know about our business, are many times 2 to 3 to 4x higher than what we would normally see in the second quarter. 
In terms of incremental costs, as one would expect, putting in place safety parameters and personal protective equipment has certainly come with costs in our stores, and we are happy that we have made those investments and happy that we were able to procure all those supplies in a very efficient way, but that does come with additional costs. We're also seeing costs associated with what it takes to then run stores in this new operating model in terms of the level of labor, in order to keep customers and associates safe, in order to be able to guide customers through the store, in order to be doing the ongoing sanitation of the store and the product, as I mentioned earlier. So that all comes with additional costs. 
And then in other parts of the supply chain, whether it's in our fulfillment centers that we are, again, from a safety standpoint, operating differently, including in some cases paying premium pay in order to procure enough labor as well as, as we look upstream in terms of our base of supply and in terms of our distribution and logistics network. We are seeing some inflationary pressure there on wages in order to procure enough labor. 
So that's at a high level, how I would describe both of those things. Stuart, I don't know if there's any other color you would add either from a VS or a total perspective."

So the store closure activity for Victoria's has been largely complete. Not fully complete, but largely complete. We remain comfortable with the estimate of about 250 stores closing this year in North America. The difference between largely and fully is we have some ongoing dialogue with landlords, property owners, developers on some of these situations. And so not all those -- not all 250 are fully resolved. But again, we remain comfortable with the estimate and an important decision for the business, as you appreciate. 
With respect to sales transfer, as you would also intuit or understand, there is a range of outcomes. We remain comfortable with the 30% to 40%. A portion of that, as the minority portion, call it, 5% I'm generalizing, is going to the digital business, the balance going to nearby stores. As you would understand, the specifics vary by trade area. So a lot of this gets down to shopping patterns, traffic flows, et cetera, in trade areas. It's how we look at it. 
And lastly, Alex, you asked if the roundly 30% to 40% is generally consistent with our past history. And the short answer to that question is, yes, and so we've done more testing on this a year ago. As we got somewhat more aggressive with closures last year, we learned more. We had experience prior to that. But again, what we're seeing is that 30% to 40% range, again, expecting that activity to be EBITDA and profit-neutral as we move through, and we think a healthy thing for the business. We all know what's going on in retailing generally. And for the VS NewCo business, we believe this is an important step, a good step for the long-term health and profitability of the business. So that's where we're at."

So on your first question in terms of the capacity ramp-up, obviously, we are making any and all investments required in order to procure that capacity. That means working with more fulfillment centers than what we had at this time last year or even at the peak of holiday. We're already operating with more centers this year than last year by about 2x, and that magnitude will continue as we move through the rest of the year. 
In terms of the other investments being made into those centers, obviously, I described many of the investments associated with safety and making sure that we have adequate protocols, PPE equipment as well as labor in those stores. Those are really the investments that we'll be making from a capacity standpoint. 
From a -- your question around the percent of sale for Bath & Body Works direct and other capabilities that we're looking to add to the direct business over time. I think it's important to just reground ourselves on where has Bath & Body Works online historically been as a percent of the total business. So it finished 2019 at just under 20% of total revenue for the Bath & Body Works segment but had been growing rapidly over the past several years: over the prior 5 years, compounded average growth rate in the high 20s and the prior 2 years, 2019 and 2018, growing at about 30% per year. So already a large and fast-growing portion of the business. 
That said, as you would have seen in our materials released last night for the spring season to date, the first 6 months of the year, Bath & Body Works direct was about 42% of revenue, obviously, peaking in the time frame that stores were closed. But even as the majority of stores have reopened here through July and into August, the direct business as a percent of sales has continued in the high 20s to 30% range, and that's frankly how we're modeling the business go forward. 
In terms of capability, you would have noticed that we have added the capability of Buy Online Pick Up In Store. That is not something that the business had as a capability prior to second quarter of 2020. We have added that into, at this point, a little over 60 of our locations. 45 of those locations are specifically Buy Online Pick Up In Store, curbside only. That was a model that we were fortunate to have available to us in California when some stores that had reopened were forced to close as a result of governmental and jurisdiction requirements in that state. So we have been able to continue to operate those stores and are pleased with the results we're seeing. Obviously, stores do more volume when they're fully open as opposed to curbside only. But it is a model that has allowed us to continue to serve our customers and associates safely in those environments. 
We do also have about a dozen locations where we have Buy Online Pick Up In Store in addition to being fully open. And we are pleased with those results as well, and we're intrigued with how to roll that out more broadly as we move through the rest of the year. Again, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we do need to smooth volume out from our peaks in terms of peak days and peak time frames. And certainly, the Buy Online Pick Up In Store option that allows the customer to lock in her sale, but then come and pick it up several days later is a key part of the strategy to do that as we move into the back half. 
In terms of other capabilities, you've heard us talk about our loyalty pilot over the last couple of years. With the onset of the pandemic, we have not rolled that more broadly, but we continue to be intrigued and pleased with the results we're seeing there and do believe that we'll take that out more broadly as we move into fiscal 2020, '21. And we're also looking at other, what I'll call, omnichannel capabilities to, again, more closely integrate our direct channel with our stores channel. And so certainly, all of the tremendous surge in business online has had us accelerate some of the projects that were maybe back burner or further out to be faster, and we're intrigued by some of those opportunities as we move into next year. Nothing additional I would highlight, though, for balance of this year. Hopefully that helps."

It sounds like your curiosity is mostly on the Victoria's Secret side. It's Stuart. So over the last several years, the inventory levels at Victoria's and the need to promote based on consumer response to what we were doing, not being as strong as we would have hoped, has been high, meaning we've been somewhat overbought over the last 2 or 3 years. I'm speaking generally. It's varied some by line of business and by category. 
With that said, the pandemic actually creates a real opportunity for us in the positive sense to make a substantial change in the profile of inventory purchases, which we've outlined. That, in combination with what we do believe as being closer to the customer and delivering better fashion and newness, better merchandising fundamentals around good, better, best, basics with Greg, Amy and John's leadership in those areas as the key merchant leaders in the business. The combination of those things gives us a real reason to believe, along with some focus on getting the cost balance in line, that we've got a real opportunity to deliver good experiences to customers and substantially improve the profitability, the merchandise margin rates in the business. 
Obviously, being appropriately in stock for the customer in core categories and key sizes is a fundamental and something that needs to be. And we will remain very focused on delivering a good experience for her. So we understand the importance of that. We're managing that well. But really the need to fundamentally become much more conservative on the inventory buy or the purchases, again triggered by the pandemic, has a silver lining to it in that it provided a real clarity to the organization about buying much more conservatively and then chasing in the business when the trend was, in fact, there. So that's where we are. We understand that being in stock is important. 
But in terms of overall turn in the business, importantly, in certain categories, we were turning reasonably well or at a level that we're very comfortable with. And in other categories, we had meaningful opportunity to improve the turn in the business. And again, the combination of everything I've just described, I think, is going to get us to a much healthier balance between inventory levels and purchases and the underlying demand. So that's where we're at on. Thanks."

Again, because we don't know -- it's a very wide range of outcomes that are possible. And so we want to be able to absolutely chase to the upside if we're able to continue a trend more like what we've seen year-to-date, but also use our agility as we have historically to also cut back if, in fact, things don't materialize to the level that we would expect them to. 
So as a reminder, the Bath & Body Works supply chain is almost fully a domestic supply chain, and a lot of it is actually produced right here in central Ohio. And so that gives us, again, tremendous flexibility and agility. And allows us to, as you mentioned, really chase into trends. So in our vernacular, maximize winners and minimize losers or things that end up performing worse than our expectations. The ability to do that has been a critical part of our historical success, and we're absolutely relying on it already through the first half of the year because we were surprised to the upside in the second quarter. And so Bath & Body Works had originally cut back pretty substantially on receipts at the beginning of the quarter, but we were able to successfully chase back into receipts through the quarter in order to meet our demand that exceeded our expectations, and we would expect to be able to use that same flexibility and agility in the back half. 
In terms of your question around gifting strategy and specific assembled gift sets versus more open stock gifting. Again, I think it's important to remind everyone that Bath & Body Works is absolutely a gifting destination for customers year round at any point in time. At the height of holiday, probably 50% to 60% of customers claim to be coming in for gifts. Even the rest of the year, that number is in the 30% to 40% range. So year-round gifting is something that we focus on for sure at Bath & Body Works, and we see that as a successful driver of the business. 
As we move into this particular Christmas, I would say, based on several years of testing results around the pros and cons of having assembled gift sets, we certainly have moved over the last couple of years to having fewer, smaller portion of our business in those assembled gift sets. And later, meaning closer to Christmas as opposed to earlier in the holiday season, is when that business really peaks. And so we'll continue to rely on those learnings to impact our flow of assembled gifts in terms of amount and timing. But again, what that does have us focus on then is ensuring that the whole assortment that's available for customers inside of the holiday time frame is giftable and making that as easy as possible for her with things like cellophane wrap available for all customers, ribbons to create gifts. Our associates are happy to create those gifts for you in-store as well as provide you with supplies to do that from home. So gifting in general as much, if not more of a focus this year than it's ever been. Hope that's helpful."

Earlier in this call, we talked about the benefits of a more conservative posture on inventory purchase levels, how aggressive we're buying and how that has an effect on promotional activity. So that's been an important change. It's starting to bear some fruit. I talked about the work that Greg, Amy and John are doing in beauty, PINK, Victoria's, lingerie and the fundamentals that they're pursuing in terms of merchandising fundamentals, easy things to say, but hard to do, really gaining some traction and seeing across all major categories healthy average unit retail growth and meaningful margin rate improvements, which is certainly indication of a better, stronger response from consumers with respect to what we're selling. 
We are implementing a profit improvement plan that we've talked about. A lot of that benefit relates to the Victoria's Secret NewCo business. But with all that said, we got a lot of work in front of us. We're -- the businesses results have declined substantially over the last few years. We're not, in any way, out of touch with reality about where we are. But with that said, and in the spirit of your question, I sense a real stabilization. And with the combination of actions that we're pursuing and that we've talked about, I see the opportunity for that stabilization and then for resuming to a pattern of growth, most importantly at retail in terms of top line and margin dollars, again in combination with the cost-rationalization actions that we've pursued. 
Maybe lastly and a lot into the -- in my response, but it all is -- all these factors matter. Amy has done important work on the PINK brand positioning. John is doing important work on the Victoria's brand positioning. Some of the changes, one might argue have been subtle so far, but we have indication that the consumer is noticing those changes and those are important changes, and there's more to come on both those things. 
So we've got a lot in front of us. Again, we're not confused about where we are. You put that in combination in operating in an environment that's a pandemic, with the effect of closing stores and the earlier conversations around store capacity and so on at holiday. But feeling like the business is stabilizing and that we're creating the platform for growth. So that would be my perspective on Victoria's. Thanks."

In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores opened. So again, to reiterate what those were, obviously, when you have a very small number of stores open in the early part of the quarter, as a reminder, we -- for Bath & Body Works, started the quarter with only 23 stores reopened in North America. And we gradually increased that number by about 50 a week through May, about a couple of hundred a week through June and then down to about 100 a week through July to get to that essentially fully reopened as we sit here now in mid-August. But as you would expect, when very few stores were reopened and only a couple of stores in each market early in the quarter, we obviously saw a tremendously high comps out of those locations as they were drawing from a multiple store trade radius. 
Obviously, in our categories, too, which is a use-up category, where if you're loyal to our products, whether again that's soap or body care or home fragrance, you tend to, if you're using it every day, go through it in about 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the product category, which means as stores were closed, there was clearly some pent-up demand. And while some customers did move their purchasing online, many customers waited for our stores to reopen. And so we certainly felt some of that impact as we reopened. And then also, as mentioned, obviously, industry-wide, there's a tremendous demand for soap and sanitizers. And so we certainly felt the benefit of being a strong player in that category. 
All of that said, even as stores were opened for a longer period of time. So specifically, stores that opened late in Q1 or early in Q2, by the end of the second quarter, we were still seeing very strong double-digit comps out of those locations. And again, that's what we're looking at and again, building our upside views to assume that -- what would it take to maintain that kind of a trend while also managing to downsides, again, either based on capacity or if there were to be a change in momentum in the business. 
On your question regarding BOPIS, I think maybe it's -- or Buy Online Pick Up In Store, I think it's important to clarify that the capability that I described earlier was specific to Bath & Body Works. That's the only locations right now where we are utilizing that Buy Online Pick Up In Store capability. 
In terms of your question around what do those -- the profile of those transactions look like relative to ""a normal transaction"". Again, when you're buying online, you're doing so through the website and then directing the purchase ultimately to be fulfilled in one of our stores. But the profile of those transactions look very similar to our other online transactions. Our online transactions tend to have a slightly average order -- higher, slightly average order size than our in-store transactions. But in terms of margin or category mix, very similar to a ""normal or average transaction"". So not something that we would think go forward drives a material change. Hope that's helpful."

So I'll try to directionally answer hopefully in a way that's helpful. So again, when we're speaking in terms of metering traffic or number of customers in the store, the percent capacity that we're talking about there is generally a capacity that's given by local authorities around what would the fire marshal, for example, say, is a safe number of people to have in the store at any point in time. And we've pegged that 30% directionally number due to really looking at what does that allow for in terms of social distancing of associates and customers throughout the store. So obviously, in many days of the week and many times of the year, that's not a problem at all, meaning that even at a 30% capacity, we don't -- that doesn't create a line outside the store at all. But at other times of the year, in the peak of holiday, that's obviously what we're looking at and trying to figure out. 
So in terms of that number itself, we certainly will be continuing to test and monitor. That, again, the priority is safety. So we're not going to make any changes to that if we think that requires us to compromise on safety and social distancing. But certainly, we are continuing to monitor to see if that number is right. 
The other part of your question was around modeling. What does that allow us to do in terms of covering last year revenue? So obviously, in the second quarter, even with those parameters in place and even more stringent parameters in place earlier in the quarter, you saw that, obviously, there was no constraint in terms of our ability to maximize revenue in the stores. Traffic into our locations in the second quarter was down. It was down in the high single-digit range. There was some differentiation of that traffic between mall stores and non-mall stores. It was down more in mall stores. It was actually up in non-mall stores driving a performance differentiation between those locations. But the other parts of the selling equation were up dramatically: so conversion, up in the 30% range; and average dollar sale, up in the 40% to 50% range, so way more than an offset, obviously, to that traffic decline. And we will be relying on those metrics to continue to drive performance as we move into the back half. The combination of those things obviously means that the dollar generated by every footsteps into our store is up dramatically, up basically double to last year, if that's helpful."

But similar to the U.S., the rest of world franchise partners are now largely reopened in terms of locations around the world and also were able to very successfully shift business to online in all of their markets as well. 
So when we think about from a future potential opportunity, again, that franchise model, which is a low-capital, capital-light investment with a lot of potential upside, is something that we absolutely do believe over the next several years we will want to expand further into additional geographies. Because, again, we have seen it perform well essentially everywhere we've gone. 
In terms of specifics around that, again, in the midst of still figuring out 2020 and operating safely, we're not going to speculate on what that will be go forward. But certainly, an important profitable business and one that we do see with growth potential go forward."

The third quarter of 2020 continue to be an unprecedented time for the world, the retail industry and certainly our business. Our first priority continues to be the safety of our associates and our customers. 
Our new operating models in our stores are focused on providing a safe environment while also providing an engaging shopping experience. Additionally, we remain focused on the safe operations of our distribution centers, fulfillment centers and call centers while maximizing our direct businesses. We delivered record results in the third quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of all associates across our business, in our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers and our home offices. I'd like to express our deep appreciation for their dedication and their efforts. 
In the third quarter, we significantly exceeded our internal expectations, driven by record results at Bath & Body Works as well as an improved performance at Victoria's Secret. As we look to the remainder of the year, we have a cautious view of the fourth quarter, given the high level of uncertainty around the pandemic itself and the potential for further restrictions. While we are optimistic about our Christmas product assortment and our continued strong execution in both stores and online, we do expect significant challenges in generating store channel sales growth. 
Our typical holiday volumes are about 3x larger per week than the average week in the third quarter historically. And the current capacity limitations that range from 25% to 50% of normal capacity will not allow us to see the same number of customers on peak days that we have in prior years. The situation remains fluid, as additional capacity limits have been recently announced and further restrictions may occur. Additionally, the hours which stores are permitted to be open are fewer than last year, and we will be closed on Thanksgiving day this year versus open in prior years. We also have additional constraints in our direct channel fulfillment and shipping capacities. 
As a result, we will be taking action to spread our big promotions, which historically have occurred on single days over a longer time period. We have also added additional registers to stores in both businesses. We expect continued increased cost pressures in the fourth quarter as a result of higher store selling costs, safety, equipment and supply costs, increased fulfillment expense and higher parcel carrier surcharges in the direct channel. We believe that all of the factors mentioned above have the potential to lead to a very wide range of financial outcomes for the fourth quarter, the higher end of which would approximate last year's operating income results. 
We will continue to stay close to our customers and leverage the speed and agility that we have in the business to optimize our fourth quarter results. Thank you, and back over to you, Amie."

So on your first question, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks from last evening, we did see continued strong balance of performance across all our categories. And so I think there has been understandably a lot of attention paid to the tremendous growth that we're seeing in our soap and sanitizer business, and we certainly count ourselves fortunate to be a major player in that category and have been for many years. As a reminder, historically, that category, the soap and sanitizer business has been about 14% of the total business in 2019, as an example. And as we've talked about on this call throughout the course of the year, that penetration has grown significantly. In Q1, it was about 1/4 of the business. Q2, a little over 1/4 of the business. And in Q3, it was still at about 21% of the business, up from mid-teens last year. So significant growth still doubling in terms of absolute volume in that business. But as we called out in the remarks, we're also seeing very strong performance from all of our other categories. So again, our 2 other big categories of home fragrance and body care, each of them grew by more than 30% in the third quarter as well. So strong and balanced business across the board and that's true in our stores channel and in our direct channels. 
On your second part of your question around the multiyear opportunity. Again, I think it's important to understand that even before the pandemic, Bath & Body Works have, for years, been experiencing nice consistent growth really across all of our categories. And our market share opportunity is still large. While we have big market share, in all of our categories. Each of those categories themselves, meaning the soap and sanitizer category, the home fragrance category and the body care category are experiencing growth at the industry level, and we continue to see the opportunity for us to gain share in each of those. 
In terms of your last question around trend, I would say that consistent with what we talked about on the last earnings call, certainly, as stores have been open longer, we have seen some normalization of the sales trend in our stores channel. And that continued, certainly from the end of the second quarter through the third quarter. But still, even at the end of the quarter, we're performing quite nicely at double digit comps. Our direct channel, as you can see from our results, has continued to deliver very consistent results regardless of when -- whether or not stores were closed back in the early part of Q2 or here through the end of Q2 and early part of Q3 as all stores have reopened. 
Hopefully, that helps with your question."

As businesses are valued off of historic and forward-looking on EBITDA and cash flow, we made material progress on those measures in the third quarter, and we would expect that the business is worth meaningfully more than it might have been in the recent past. We're at the beginning. We've got a lot more to do. There's a lot of additional growth and opportunity in the business. But there's no doubt that the third quarter was an important inflection point in the business. 
With respect to the second part of your question, the board has been clear about the strategic intent for Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret, and that is to ensure that both businesses are valued appropriately, including the appropriate valuation of Bath & Body Works, which we believe will be enhanced through a separation of the businesses.

With that said, the outcomes of those negotiations did not have a over material effect on the third quarter and their effect on the fourth quarter is still subject to a full papering and finalization of those negotiations. We will provide more update after we conclude the fourth quarter about the specifics and the impact on Q4. Again, if the Q4 impact will be more significant than the Q3 impact and again, the element of that in Q3, we would comment as not being overly material to the total result.

As a reminder, we made the decision to reduce that number back early in the first half of the year based on the onset of the pandemic and out of an abundance of caution to make sure we were managing cash flow and capital spending overall. The decision to reduce the number of deals this year was not driven by any change in the performance that we've seen associated with those remodels over the last several years, which we continue to be very pleased with that progress. So all of that said, as we look forward to 2021, it is still critically important for us to read the results here of the all-important fourth quarter to help influence any go-forward capital investment strategy around real estate. And we have a very flexible and agile pipeline as it applies to our real estate portfolio.

And that's obviously what allowed us to run the growth that we ran of well over 100% in the direct channel in Q3. As you can imagine, as we move into the fourth quarter, what we're up against from a historical sales and capacity is significantly higher than what we saw through the first 3 quarters of the year. So while we will have significantly more capacity available year-over-year in Q3, it almost certainly won't be at the same level of growth as what we were able to achieve in the first 3 quarters of the year.

That nets off some of the increase that is associated with the second facility that we opened this year. So there is some net increase in unit capacity, but not as great as we would have expected given the need for social distancing within our centers to ensure that we have a safe environment for our associates. Additionally, that's a comment about units. We've experienced significant average unit retail growth, both online and in stores at Victoria's Secret. And so that does provide further upside, Lorraine, in terms of revenue growth versus a strict view on units. So we feel like we can generate meaningful growth in the fourth quarter given the larger denominator and absolute value it will moderate to some extent. And we'll manage the balance, ensuring that we keep all involved safe, provide the right experience for consumers and again, importantly, a big source of growth through pricing increases, average unit retail increases that we realized in Q3 and we would expect to continue in Q4."

I think it's important to understand how we got to the margin improvements that we saw in Q3 and then talk about how we might see that play out slightly differently in Q4. So in the third quarter, we were able to increase margins across the board by combination of both fewer days of promotion, deep promotional activity year-over-year, down relatively substantially, order of magnitude, about half as many big deep promotional days in the third quarter versus the third quarter prior year. But then we were also able to increase the price point on many of those promotions. And so the combination of those 2 things as well as not having to have an end of third quarter fall sale the way we have historically because we saw such good response to our collections and sold down to the point where we were actually putting some of our holiday product on the floor late in the third quarter. Those were the drivers of the improvement in Q3. As talked about in our prepared remarks, we also did testing in the third quarter to understand how to lap some of the very large days that we've got in the fourth quarter from a promotional standpoint. And attempt to regain the sales and margin dollars associated with those big days. And in doing those tests, affirmed that the best way to do it is to try to take the pressure off of those peak days, spread them out across multiple days, but also have them at higher price points than we have historically. So really the issue of why we would expect fourth quarter margin rates to margin rate improvement to moderate and probably more closely approximate last year is that combination of more days. We're going -- in the third quarter, there were fewer days of big promotion in the fourth quarter that will end up having to be more days of big promotion in order to spread out that mark. As Stuart mentioned earlier, obviously, we're going to continue to be very nimble. We're going to continue to drive to the best possible outcome. If we're seeing better product acceptance and are able to either reduce the number of promotional days and/or raise those promotional prices, the way we were in third quarter, we'll obviously do that. But as we go in and look at the magnitude of those big days, that's our going-in assumption."

But as an overall comment in terms of how we're approaching inventory receipts. The first thing I would say, which blinding the statement of the obvious is that we're approaching them with a heck of a lot of intensity. The additional points I'd want to make is really beginning with the onset of the pandemic, particularly for Victoria's Secret, given the store closure plans, but just otherwise trend in the business. We began planning this spring very conservatively with respect to inventory receipts. And fortunate outcome of that is that through that better inventory position, where we don't have to have broad-based -- as many broad-based promotions, along with better assortments, better selling effectiveness online and in stores, it's really giving rise to the significant margin rate improvements that we experienced in the third quarter than we would expect in the fourth quarter. With that said, where we've got sales trend, you can be sure that we're chasing like heck. And the good news is that we have supply chain partners, manufacturing partners that we have long-standing relationships in a very clear mind about how to move quickly and with agility and the best we can. So overall, had a very conservative position with Victoria's, it's paying big dividends to the company. In combination with, again, better merchandise, better assortments, better presentation, better marketing, better selling. And where we got trend, we're chasing like heck.

I would echo a lot of Stuart's commentary around appreciation for the supply chain and the tremendous flexibility and agility that all of our internal and external partners have been able to accommodate us with so far this year. We talked about on the last quarter call that originally at the onset of the pandemic, Bath & Body Works also cut back receipts pretty dramatically but then ended up needing to chase back into many of those receipts through Q2, and that trend continued in Q3 of chasing to the upside. As we enter our fourth quarter, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we feel good about our overall inventory position. We feel very fortunate that our supply chain has been able to weather the pandemic and has figured out how to operate both in a very safe way, but also increased capacity and output relative to our sales increase. The reality, as I shared earlier, is we did exceed our expectations from a sales and a sell-through on our seasonal goods in the third quarter. So as I mentioned in the prior answer around margin, we were able to cut back and not do a fall end of Q3 sale this year based on that sell through. That obviously has allowed us to be very, very clean from an inventory standpoint as we come into the fourth quarter. It also allowed us to get an early read on some of our holiday goods at the end of the third quarter. And we're pleased, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're pleased with the early product acceptance that we're seeing to those holiday assortments, and we believe our overall inventory levels are positioned appropriately as we now head into the fourth quarter."

So on your first piece, I'll get to maybe the stickiness second. But on the customer piece, as we shared on the last earnings call, coming out of the first 6 months of the year, based on the stores closure for about 90 days in the first half of the year, we had seen fewer customers year-to-date through the first 6 months. The good news is, in the third quarter, we saw substantially more customers year-over-year in both channels, stores and our online channel. But that does still leave us year-to-date as we exit the third quarter, down slightly low single-digit customers fewer than last year at this point, again, driven by that approximately 90-day period where the majority of our stores were closed. In terms of the profile around the customers, as you would expect, we've seen tremendous growth out of our direct channel customer file, order of magnitude about double last year. And within that, we've seen very nice growth amongst new customers, new to the brand and new to the channel. And we're seeing nice improvement in the number of customers who shop both in stores and online. Directionally, those -- that number of customers is up over 70% year-over-year. And as a reminder, those are our most productive customers spend about 3x more than a single channel customer to spend. Within the customer mix, we're also seeing very nice, as you would expect, growth in our soap and sanitizer customer base, and that has allowed for more cross-category shopping of customers as well. And similar to the cross channel, mix benefits across category mix benefit is also significant, meaning that a customer who shops multiple categories is more valuable than a customer who only shops single category. 
As your question then around stickiness and around how, if at all, the vaccine would impact our planning for next year. I guess, at a high level, all of us are hoping and praying for a vaccine to come as soon as possible so that, first and foremost, all of our friends, family associates can live in a safer world go forward. Certainly, we would expect that, that will start to have some impact on customer shopping behavior. But I do believe that some of what we've experienced so far this year is probably here to stay in terms of how customers behave, for example, some of the growth and movement to the direct channel, I think, has been an acceleration of a multiyear trend that we had already been observing. And so I would expect that to continue. When you think about our categories, I think the good news is for Bath & Body Works, the categories that we play in were, again, super strong and relevant before the pandemic. In a couple of cases, I think they've actually been enhanced by the pandemic, specifically soaps and sanitizers and to a lesser extent, but still material our home fragrance business as well with people spending a lot more time in their homes. But I would expect that those, again, were strong categories before. We'll continue to be strong growth categories at the industry level and for our business go forward. And I do think that some personal habits will have changed on a relatively permanent basis in terms of customers' focus on hand washing and overall safe safer lifestyle choices when it comes to keeping clean go forward. So long-winded answer to say nothing about what we're seeing would have us have any less confidence in the long-term prospects of the business."

But in other cases, where the promotional strategy is around a sharp price point around an individual item. In general, we are planning for those price points to be up versus last year.

But I'll attempt to offer response without going into detail on that. But at the end of the day, with the capacity constraints that we've articulated, and I know, as you appreciate, the reality is the situation around capacity and regulations outside of our control is a very fluid one with different states and municipalities, changing perspectives on that on a frequent basis. But if we just use our overall view, which prior to any of those jurisdictional changes, we had gotten comfortable in both businesses running between 40% and 50% of max capacity to last year. And again, some jurisdictions will require us to operate with less than that. But if you think about that as a cap, if you will, on traffic, on the biggest days of the year because, again, it's only on the biggest days of the year where that max capacity does come into play. But with traffic on those biggest days of the year, being down 50-plus percent based on those capacity constraints even with the big improvements we're seeing in both businesses around conversion and around average dollar sale. You can understand that we will not be able to hit the total volumes that we saw on those biggest days from last year, thus, the strategy to spread them out.

So Andrew, starting on BBW, it looks like operating margins this year are on pace to be kind of mid- to high 20s. How are you thinking about potential normalization in fiscal '21? Or maybe if you don't want to give specific numbers, I guess, just any learnings from 2020 that would impact the prior framework such as the business could operate at structurally higher margins versus the roughly 23% of the business was at over the last several years. 
And then for Stuart, a pretty remarkable recovery in the VS margin this quarter. It would seem like the business is now well on the way to breakeven this year. And if we carry forward the Q3 inflection to next year, the brand would seem to be nicely profitable again. But obviously tough to extrapolate 1 quarter. So just understanding that there's a lot of near term uncertainty, any high-level thoughts you can share on where the brand is from a run rate profitability perspective today?"

So I would say it's likely that both 2020 and 2021 will be somewhat unique in terms of what that operating margin profile looks like, especially in different time periods throughout the year. But if we're talking about a more long-term basis for the business, we've been very consistent saying that we believe this is a business that can and should operate in the low 20% range from an operating income ROS. And there's nothing that we're seeing today that would make us have a different perspective on that on a go-forward basis."

However, strategically, as you know, from your following of us and others in the industry, similarly situated businesses with brand power and in strong categories and within our own history can be mid- to high teens operating income rate businesses, they can. If you look at lots of players over long periods of time when performing really well and executing really well. That's where you can be. Now we're a long way from that. We've just finished 1 solid quarter. So we got a lot of work in front of us, but there's a lot of opportunity.

In terms of the product mix and any material impact that, that has on margin, the short answer there would be not a material one. All of our categories that we operate in are high-margin categories. The soap and sanitizer business, specifically within that is about at the average of our overall margin profile. So nothing that, that growth or change would have as an impact to our overall rates."

The third quarter of 2020 continued to be an unprecedented time for the world, the retail industry and certainly our business. Our first priority continues to be the safety of our associates and our customers. 
Our new operating models in our stores are focused on providing a safe environment while also providing an engaging shopping experience. Additionally, we remain focused on the safe operations of our distribution centers, fulfillment centers and call centers while maximizing our direct businesses. 
We delivered record results in the third quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of all associates across our business, in our stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers and our home offices. I'd like to express our deep appreciation for their dedication and their efforts.  
In the third quarter, we significantly exceeded our internal expectations, driven by record results at Bath & Body Works as well as an improved performance at Victoria's Secret. 
As we look to the remainder of the year, we have a cautious view of the fourth quarter, given the high level of uncertainty around the pandemic itself and the potential for further restrictions. While we are optimistic about our Christmas product assortment and our continued strong execution in both stores and online, we do expect significant challenges in generating store channel sales growth.  
Our typical holiday volumes are about 3x larger per week than the average week in the third quarter historically. And the current capacity limitations that range from 25% to 50% of normal capacity will not allow us to see the same number of customers on peak days that we have in prior years. 
The situation remains fluid, as additional capacity limits have been recently announced and further restrictions may occur. Additionally, the hours which stores are permitted to be open are fewer than last year, and we will be closed on Thanksgiving Day this year versus open in prior years. We also have additional constraints in our direct channel fulfillment and shipping capacities.  
As a result, we will be taking action to spread our big promotions, which historically have occurred on single days over a longer time period. We have also added additional registers to stores in both businesses. We expect continued increased cost pressures in the fourth quarter as a result of higher store selling costs, safety, equipment and supply costs, increased fulfillment expense and higher parcel carrier surcharges in the direct channel. 
We believe that all of the factors mentioned above have the potential to lead to a very wide range of financial outcomes for the fourth quarter, the higher end of which would approximate last year's operating income results.  
We will continue to stay close to our customers and leverage the speed and agility that we have in the business to optimize our fourth quarter results. Thank you, and back over to you, Amie."

So on your first question, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks from last evening, we did see continued strong balance of performance across all our categories. And so I think there has been understandably a lot of attention p",469,"Sure. Thank you, Matthew. So on your first question, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks from last evening, we did see continued strong balance of performance across all our categories. And so I think there has been understandably a lot of attention paid to the tremendous growth that we're seeing in our soap and sanitizer business, and we certainly count ourselves fortunate to be a major player in that category and have been for many years. 
As a reminder, historically, that category, the soap and sanitizer business, has been about 14% of the total business in 2019, as an example. And as we've talked about on this call throughout the course of the year, that penetration has grown significantly. In Q1, it was about 1/4 of the business. Q2, a little over 1/4 of the business. And in Q3, it was still at about 21% of the business, up from mid-teens last year. So significant growth, still doubling in terms of absolute volume in that business. 
But as we called out in the remarks, we're also seeing very strong performance from all of our other categories. So again, our 2 other big categories of home fragrance and body care, each of them grew by more than 30% in the third quarter as well. So strong and balanced business across the board, and that's true in our stores channel and in our direct channels.  
On your second part of your question around the multiyear opportunity. Again, I think it's important to understand that even before the pandemic, Bath & Body Works has, for years, been experiencing nice consistent growth really across all of our categories. And our market share opportunity is still large. While we have big market share in all of our categories, each of those categories themselves, meaning the soap and sanitizer category, the home fragrance category and the body care category, are experiencing growth at the industry level. And we continue to see the opportunity for us to gain share in each of those.  
In terms of your last question around trend, I would say that consistent with what we talked about on the last earnings call, certainly, as stores have been open longer, we have seen some normalization of the sales trend in our stores channel. And that continued, certainly from the end of the second quarter through the third quarter. But still, even at the end of the quarter, we're performing quite nicely at double digit comps. 
Our direct channel, as you can see from our results, has continued to deliver very consistent results regardless of when -- whether or not stores were closed back in the early part of Q2 or here through the end of Q2 and early part of Q3 as all stores have reopened. Hopefully, that helps with your question."

I guess maybe, Andrew, has the thinking changed on how to handle your ownership of the brand? And I guess, it's really 2 questions. 
It's first, is it fair to say that the asking price for the brand has moved up given the material EBITDA improvements that you've been making over the past 6 months and the inflection that the team is now driving? And then two, is there actually a chance that given the success the new team is having in managing the brand and making these key strategic changes that maybe ultimately you decide that you don't want to sell the business, and you actually feel like you're creating a lot of value with the improvements you're making?"

As businesses are valued off of historic and forward-looking EBITDA and cash flow, we made material progress on those measures in the third quarter, and we would expect that the business is worth meaningfully more than it might have been in the recent past. We're at the beginning. We've got a lot more to do. There's a lot of additional growth and opportunity in the business. But there's no doubt that the third quarter was an important inflection point in the business.  
With respect to the second part of your question, the Board has been clear about the strategic intent for Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret, and that is to ensure that both businesses are valued appropriately, including the appropriate valuation of Bath & Body Works, which we believe will be enhanced through a separation of the businesses. We continue to be on a path after we get a good visibility to the full Q4 results to work with our advisers that we hired back in August, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, to work with those advisers and to begin a process in earnest to pursue the options for the separation of the 2 companies."

As a reminder, we made the decision to reduce that number back early in the first half of the year based on the onset of the pandemic and out of an abundance of caution to make sure we were managing cash flow and capital spending overall. The decision to reduce the number of deals this year was not driven by any change in the performance that we've seen associated with those remodels over the last several years, which we continue to be very pleased with that progress. 
So all of that said, as we look forward to 2021, it is still critically important for us to read the results here of the all-important fourth quarter to help influence any go-forward capital investment strategy around real estate.

But in the case of Bath & Body Works, we have dramatically increased our capacity as we've moved through the year 2020 to the point where in third quarter, we were able to be looking at about 2.5x the amount of capacity that we had last year. And that's obviously what allowed us to run the growth that we ran of well over 100% in the direct channel in Q3. 
As you can imagine, as we move into the fourth quarter, what we're up against from a historical sales and capacity is significantly higher than what we saw through the first 3 quarters of the year. So while we will have significantly more capacity available year-over-year in Q3, it almost certainly won't be at the same level of growth as what we were able to achieve in the first 3 quarters of the year.

Additionally, that's a comment about units. We've experienced significant average unit retail growth, both online and in stores at Victoria's Secret. And so that does provide further upside, units. So we feel like we can generate meaningful growth in the fourth quarter given the larger denominator and absolute value it will moderate to some extent.

I think it's important to understand how we got to the margin improvements that we saw in Q3 and then talk about how we might see that play out slightly differently in Q4. 
So in the third quarter, we were able to increase margins across the board by combination of both fewer days of promotion, deep promotional activity year-over-year, down relatively substantially, order of magnitude about half as many big deep promotional days in the third quarter versus the third quarter prior year. But then we were also able to increase the price point on many of those promotions. 
And so the combination of those 2 things as well as not having to have an end of third quarter fall sale the way we have historically, because we saw such good response to our collections and sold down to the point where we were actually putting some of our holiday product on the floor late in the third quarter, those were the drivers of the improvement in Q3. 
As talked about in our prepared remarks, we also did testing in the third quarter to understand how to lap some of the very large days that we've got in the fourth quarter from a promotional standpoint and attempt to regain the sales and margin dollars associated with those big days. And in doing those tests, affirmed that the best way to do it is to try to take the pressure off of those peak days, spread them out across multiple days, but also have them at higher price points than we have historically. 
So really the issue of why we would expect fourth quarter margin rates to -- margin rate improvement to moderate and probably more closely approximate last year is that combination of more days. We're going -- in the third quarter, there were fewer days of big promotion, in the fourth quarter there will end up having to be more days of big promotion in order to spread out that volume. 
As Stuart mentioned earlier, obviously, we're going to continue to be very nimble. We're going to continue to drive to the best possible outcome. If we're seeing better product acceptance and are able to either reduce the number of promotional days and/or raise those promotional prices the way we were in third quarter, we'll obviously do that. But as we go in and look at the magnitude of those big days, that's our going-in assumption."

But as an overall comment in terms of how we're approaching inventory receipts, the first thing I would say, which may be a blinding statement of the obvious is that we're approaching them with a heck of a lot of intensity. 
The additional points I'd want to make is really beginning with the onset of the pandemic, particularly for Victoria's Secret, given the store closure plans, but just otherwise trend in the business, we began planning this spring very conservatively with respect to inventory receipts. 
And the fortunate outcome of that is that through that better inventory position, where we don't have to have broad-based -- as many broad-based promotions, along with better assortments, better selling effectiveness online and in stores, it's really giving rise to the significant margin rates improvements that we experienced in the third quarter and that we would expect in the fourth quarter. 
With that said, where we've got sales trend, you can be sure that we're chasing like heck. And the good news is that we have supply chain partners, manufacturing partners that we have long-standing relationships  and a very clear mind about how to move quickly and with agility the best we can. 
So overall, had a very conservative position with Victoria's. It's paying big dividends to the company. In combination with, again, better merchandise, better assortments, better presentation, better marketing, better selling. And where we got trend, we're chasing like heck.

I would echo a lot of Stuart's commentary around appreciation for the supply chain and the tremendous flexibility and agility that all of our internal and external partners have been able to accommodate us with -- so far this year. We talked about, on the last quarter call, that originally at the onset of the pandemic, Bath & Body Works also cut back receipts pretty dramatically but then ended up needing to chase back into many of those receipts through Q2, and that trend continued in Q3 of chasing to the upside. 
As we enter our fourth quarter, as we've shared in our prepared remarks, we feel good about our overall inventory position. We feel very fortunate that our supply chain has been able to weather the pandemic and has figured out how to operate both in a very safe way, but also increased capacity and output relative to our sales increase. The reality, as I shared earlier, is we did exceed our expectations from a sales and a sell-through on our seasonal goods in the third quarter. 
So as I mentioned in the prior answer around margin, we were able to cut back and not do a fall end-of-Q3 sale this year based on that sell-through. That obviously has allowed us to be very, very clean from an inventory standpoint as we come into the fourth quarter. It also allowed us to get an early read on some of our holiday goods at the end of the third quarter.

I'm trying to think about the stickiness of some of the categories that obviously have been so strong during COVID. Maybe you could frame the growth, new customers coming into the franchise versus greater spend from existing customers. I'd also like to hear your views on the stickiness of soaps versus home fragrance versus body care. 
And lastly, as part of this, does the vaccine news -- the positive vaccine news affect the way you plan for beyond the pandemic next year and beyond?"

So on your first piece, I'll get to maybe the stickiness second. But on the customer piece, as we shared on the last earnings call, coming out of the first 6 months of the year, based on the stores closure for about 90 days in the first half",596,"Thanks, Omar. So on your first piece, I'll get to maybe the stickiness second. But on the customer piece, as we shared on the last earnings call, coming out of the first 6 months of the year, based on the stores closure for about 90 days in the first half of the year, we had seen fewer customers year-to-date through the first 6 months. 
The good news is, in the third quarter, we saw substantially more customers year-over-year in both channels, stores and our online channel. But that does still leave us year-to-date, as we exit the third quarter, down slightly low single-digit customers fewer than last year at this point, again, driven by that approximately 90-day period where the majority of our stores were closed. 
In terms of the profile around the customers, as you would expect, we've seen tremendous growth out of our direct channel customer file, order of magnitude about double last year. And within that, we've seen very nice growth amongst new customers, new to the brand and new to the channel. And we're seeing nice improvement in the number of customers who shop both in stores and online. Directionally, those -- that number of customers is up over 70% year-over-year. And as a reminder, those are our most productive customers, spend about 3x more than a single channel customer do spend. 
Within the customer mix, we're also seeing very nice, as you would expect, growth in our soap and sanitizer customer base, and that has allowed for more cross-category shopping of customers as well. And similar to the cross-channel mix benefit, cross-category mix benefit is also significant, meaning that a customer who shops multiple categories is more valuable than a customer who only shops single category. 
As to your question then around stickiness and around how, if at all, the vaccine would impact our planning for next year, I guess, at a high level, all of us are hoping and praying for a vaccine to come as soon as possible so that, first and foremost, all of our friends, family, associates can live in a safer world go forward. 
Certainly, we would expect that, that will start to have some impact on customer shopping behavior. But I do believe that some of what we've experienced so far this year is probably here to stay in terms of how customers behave. For example, some of the growth and movement to the direct channel, I think, has been an acceleration of a multiyear trend that we had already been observing, and so I would expect that to continue. 
When you think about our categories, I think the good news is for Bath & Body Works, the categories that we play in were, again, super strong and relevant before the pandemic. In a couple of cases, I think they've actually been enhanced by the pandemic, specifically soaps and sanitizers; and to a lesser extent but still material, our home fragrance business as well, with people spending a lot more time in their homes. 
But I would expect that those, again, were strong categories before, will continue to be strong growth categories at the industry level and for our business go forward. And I do think that some personal habits will have changed on a relatively permanent basis in terms of customers' focus on hand washing and overall safe -- safer lifestyle choices when it comes to keeping clean go forward. So long-winded answer to say nothing about what we're seeing would have us have any less confidence in the long-term prospects of the business."

And Stuart, I was wondering on the Victoria's Secrets business, if you now feel confident that you understand the direction that the brand needs to move in to recapture top line and margin and if you're able to go forward with a defined strategy, or if you're still in a bit of a test-and-learn period."

So on some days, within the fourth quarter, our promotion level will be the same as last year because those are big shop-wide deals that we'll be doing and expecting to be at a similar depth of promotion just spread out over more days. Specific example there would be our Black Friday promotional strategy, that is a shop-wide deal, would extend over more days than it did last year. 
But in other cases where the promotional strategy is around a sharp price point around an individual item, in general, we are planning for those price points to be up versus last year. But again, the impact then being the spread of those prices over more days than what were in the last year time frame. Hoping that helps."

But I'll attempt to offer a response without going into detail on that. 
But at the end of the day, with the capacity constraints that we've articulated, and I know, as you appreciate, the reality is the situation around capacity and regulations outside of our control is a very fluid one with different states and municipalities changing perspectives on that on a frequent basis. But if we just use our overall view, which prior to any of those jurisdictional changes, we had gotten comfortable in both businesses running between 40% and 50% of max capacity to last year. And again, some jurisdictions will require us to operate with less than that. 
But if you think about that as a cap, if you will, on traffic, on the biggest days of the year, because again it's only on the biggest days of the year where that max capacity does come into play, but with traffic on those biggest days of the year, being down 50-plus percent based on those capacity constraints, even with the big improvements we're seeing in both businesses around conversion and around average dollar sale, you can understand that we will not be able to hit the total volumes that we saw on those biggest days from last year. Thus, the strategy to spread them out. And without going into more detailed guidance, hopefully, that's a helpful model."

And then for Stuart, a pretty remarkable recovery in the VS margin this quarter. It would seem like the business is now well on the way to breakeven this year. And if we carry forward the Q3 inflection to next year, the brand would seem to be nicely profitable again. But obviously tough to extrapolate 1 quarter.

And our ability to service orders through mobile or through any digital platform has, again, continued to be very stable and continue to be something that we're proud of, and we will continue to make investments into those capabilities as we move into future years as well. 
In terms of the product mix and any material impact that, that has on margin, the short answer there would be not a material one. All of our categories that we operate in are high-margin categories. The soap and sanitizer business, specifically within that, is about at the average of our overall margin profile. So nothing that, that growth or change would have as an impact to our overall rates."

We have not rolled it out broadly to stores that are able to be open and operating in a fully open capacity. 
Really, the learning around the capability has been interesting. It certainly appears to have some level of -- some small level of incrementality. But really, it's most important for us as, what I'll call, an insurance policy when or if we have stores that are unable to operate, keeping them open and able to operate in that buy online pick up in store manner, especially in our off-mall locations, is a very nice safety net to now have as a capability."

The second quarter of 2020 continued to be an unprecedented time for the world, for the retail industry and for our business. Our first priority was and continues to be the safety of our associates and customers as we reopen the majority of our stores in the second quarter. We adopted new operating models in all of our stores that focused on providing a safe shopping experience. Additionally, we focused on our distribution, fulfillment and call center safety and maximizing our direct businesses. 
Overall, we delivered strong results in the second quarter, and we could not have done so without the hard work and dedication of all associates across our business: in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers, call centers and home offices. On behalf of the company, I'd like to express our deep appreciation for all of their efforts. 
During the second quarter, we also took a number of important steps to prepare Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works to operate as stand-alone, separate companies, improve L Brands' profitability, maintain liquidity during the pandemic and maximize our financial performance, all of which we outlined in the earnings commentary that we released last night. As we also discussed in last night's commentary, despite our strong results in the second quarter, we do expect results to moderate. And for a number of reasons, we have a cautious outlook for the second half of the year. We won't repeat those prepared comments this morning in order to leave more time for all of your questions.

First, as outlined in our circulated script in and as Andrew reminded us this morning, we took important steps to create or to facilitate stand-alone companies, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works in the quarter. That was the organizational work that we did, taking many shared functions and creating -- or integrating those functions, I should say, into the respective businesses, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. 
We did retain Goldman and JPMorgan very recently shortly after the end of the quarter. And we'll begin work with them where they'll give the Board and the company advice about the range of alternatives and will assist us in a process as we move forward. 
Obviously, it's important to get a read on holiday results to value the business and to ensure that we strike the right balance in terms of timing, execution risk and getting an appropriate valuation for the business. And what the company is most focused on right now is driving great results at retail. So we got a lot of people in stores, distribution centers, home offices, vendor partners, all kinds of folks organized to provide the best results at retail. And I couldn't be more proud of what this team has done over the last 90 days or so through the organizational work, reopening stores, maximizing volume on the digital channel and the digital channel. So we're very focused on having the best holiday possible. It will be important as we go down this path. And it will be important and put -- as capital markets, advisers, potential buyers, again, the public markets assess the opportunity for Victoria's Secret. So very focused on having a good holiday, have hired some banks and took a lot of important steps to create stand-alone companies. Thanks, Ike."

And as we got more and more stores open through the end of the quarter, finishing with essentially the majority of stores open and sitting here now today in mid-August, we actually have all but about 40 stores reopened. We've continued to see very strong results in both our direct channel and our stores channel. And as we've moved into August, we've seen results continue to be very strong. 
In terms of your question around our future confidence in Bath & Body Works, I would say there are also, we have a lot of belief that our trend should be able to continue as a strong market leader in all of the categories in which we play. As you can imagine, as we've discussed in the past, one of the most critical questions we always ask ourselves is, are we, in fact, in the right categories of business. And are those categories that are still relevant to our customers and growing in the marketplace? And I think it's fair to say that in the case of Bath & Body Works, the answer to that question is a strong yes across our entire portfolio. 
Obviously, the soap and sanitizer business that historically has been 14% to 15% of the business is even more important to our customers and to all of the country right now in the midst of a pandemic. So as expected, we've seen tremendous growth coming out of that category. And while that may moderate over time, we expect that awareness around the importance of that category, washing your hands, using sanitizers when you're not able to wash your hands, will continue even as the pandemic itself hopefully starts to wane away. 
In terms of our other categories, we obviously have a huge and important body care business. That business has always been relevant to our customers, is even more relevant to her today as an affordable luxury, a way for her to treat herself even when she's unable or unwilling to spend money on perhaps other larger-ticket commodities. That is an inexpensive way, whether for self-indulgence or to give as a gift. And then similarly, our important home fragrance business that has grown substantially over the last half decade, also tremendously important to her, both now during the pandemic when we're using our homes as a place of work, a place of teaching and school and a place of refuge and solace. Certainly, making your home smell like you want it to is something that our customer has continued to express interest in and again, something we would expect to continue through the pandemic and also afterwards. So again, bottom line, categories that we're in, very, very relevant today, have been relevant in the past, and we absolutely believe are just as relevant to go forward. Hope that helps."

And then second, on the costs, obviously, you'll see some incremental COVID costs in the back half. If there's any help you can give us on quantifying that?"

So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volume",820,"Thanks, Lorraine. So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volumes really since the start of the pandemic. And what that has meant is that we have substantially ramped up our fulfillment center capacity even while needing to run those fulfillment centers in a way, as we mentioned earlier, very consistent with our overall focus on safety protocols. And as you might expect, that puts some constraints on throughput and other productivity measures in those centers as we have to apply social distancing and other parameters in those centers. 
That said, we are very pleased with the ramp-up in capacity that we have already achieved in both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. And as we move into the back half of the year where volumes continue to grow, we are also on track to increase capacity even further across both networks. So feeling like we're in good shape there. But obviously, anytime there's a concern around an outbreak, that's something we have to monitor and take appropriate actions. And so again, we are cautiously optimistic that we have procured and are using capacity wisely. 
When you think about our stores channel, in some ways, it's a similar constraint in terms of the number of customers that we're able to actually allow into the stores at any point in time in order to, again, be focused on safety as our key priority as well as then our ability to process customers through our cash registers and lines within stores. As we've reopened stores, we started off with -- I'm speaking now for Bath & Body Works, a store opening pilot in late April that put a significant constraint on the number of customers we were allowing into the store early in that process, early on, keeping it at about 10% to 20% of max occupancy. As we move through the second quarter, we got comfortable with our protocols, again, around safety, social distancing, consistent sanitizing of all the surfaces and products within the store on a regular basis. And that allowed us to get comfortable with raising that max occupancy up to about 30%. But that's still going to be an issue as we move into the height of holiday in terms of how many customers do we feel comfortable metering into the store at any point in time. 
Also, in terms of a different cash wrap layout, if you've spent time in our stores, either Victoria's Secret or Bath & Body Works, you'll see that in order to allow for social distancing by our associates, not all cash wraps have been -- or not all cash registers on cash wraps have been able to be utilized. That has caused us to look at more mobile POS cash wraps in order to spread out customers and associates in the back of store to allow for that. So again, we're doing lots of additional testing here in the third quarter to simulate peak volume and understand how will that impact capacity and throughput. But those are really the reasons, Lorraine, for again, the cautious outlook as we move to volume levels in the fourth quarter that, I know you know about our business, are many times 2 to 3 to 4x higher than what we would normally see in the second quarter. 
In terms of incremental costs, as one would expect, putting in place safety parameters and personal protective equipment has certainly come with costs in our stores, and we are happy that we have made those investments and happy that we were able to procure all those supplies in a very efficient way, but that does come with additional costs. We're also seeing costs associated with what it takes to then run stores in this new operating model in terms of the level of labor, in order to keep customers and associates safe, in order to be able to guide customers through the store, in order to be doing the ongoing sanitation of the store and the product, as I mentioned earlier. So that all comes with additional costs. 
And then in other parts of the supply chain, whether it's in our fulfillment centers that we are, again, from a safety standpoint, operating differently, including in some cases paying premium pay in order to procure enough labor as well as, as we look upstream in terms of our base of supply and in terms of our distribution and logistics network. We are seeing some inflationary pressure there on wages in order to procure enough labor. 
So that's at a high level, how I would describe both of those things. Stuart, I don't know if there's any other color you would add either from a VS or a total perspective."

So the store closure activity for Victoria's has been largely complete. Not fully complete, but largely complete. We remain comfortable with the estimate of about 250 stores closing this year in North America. The difference between largely and fully is we have some ongoing dialogue with landlords, property owners, developers on some of these situations. And so not all those -- not all 250 are fully resolved. But again, we remain comfortable with the estimate and an important decision for the business, as you appreciate. 
With respect to sales transfer, as you would also intuit or understand, there is a range of outcomes. We remain comfortable with the 30% to 40%. A portion of that, as the minority portion, call it, 5% I'm generalizing, is going to the digital business, the balance going to nearby stores. As you would understand, the specifics vary by trade area. So a lot of this gets down to shopping patterns, traffic flows, et cetera, in trade areas. It's how we look at it. 
And lastly, Alex, you asked if the roundly 30% to 40% is generally consistent with our past history. And the short answer to that question is, yes, and so we've done more testing on this a year ago. As we got somewhat more aggressive with closures last year, we learned more. We had experience prior to that. But again, what we're seeing is that 30% to 40% range, again, expecting that activity to be EBITDA and profit-neutral as we move through, and we think a healthy thing for the business. We all know what's going on in retailing generally. And for the VS NewCo business, we believe this is an important step, a good step for the long-term health and profitability of the business. So that's where we're at."

So on your first question in terms of the capacity ramp-up, obviously, we are making any and all investments required in order to procure that capacity. That means working with more fulfillment centers than what we had at this time last year or even at the peak of holiday. We're already operating with more centers this year than last year by about 2x, and that magnitude will continue as we move through the rest of the year. 
In terms of the other investments being made into those centers, obviously, I described many of the investments associated with safety and making sure that we have adequate protocols, PPE equipment as well as labor in those stores. Those are really the investments that we'll be making from a capacity standpoint. 
From a -- your question around the percent of sale for Bath & Body Works direct and other capabilities that we're looking to add to the direct business over time. I think it's important to just reground ourselves on where has Bath & Body Works online historically been as a percent of the total business. So it finished 2019 at just under 20% of total revenue for the Bath & Body Works segment but had been growing rapidly over the past several years: over the prior 5 years, compounded average growth rate in the high 20s and the prior 2 years, 2019 and 2018, growing at about 30% per year. So already a large and fast-growing portion of the business. 
That said, as you would have seen in our materials released last night for the spring season to date, the first 6 months of the year, Bath & Body Works direct was about 42% of revenue, obviously, peaking in the time frame that stores were closed. But even as the majority of stores have reopened here through July and into August, the direct business as a percent of sales has continued in the high 20s to 30% range, and that's frankly how we're modeling the business go forward. 
In terms of capability, you would have noticed that we have added the capability of Buy Online Pick Up In Store. That is not something that the business had as a capability prior to second quarter of 2020. We have added that into, at this point, a little over 60 of our locations. 45 of those locations are specifically Buy Online Pick Up In Store, curbside only. That was a model that we were fortunate to have available to us in California when some stores that had reopened were forced to close as a result of governmental and jurisdiction requirements in that state. So we have been able to continue to operate those stores and are pleased with the results we're seeing. Obviously, stores do more volume when they're fully open as opposed to curbside only. But it is a model that has allowed us to continue to serve our customers and associates safely in those environments. 
We do also have about a dozen locations where we have Buy Online Pick Up In Store in addition to being fully open. And we are pleased with those results as well, and we're intrigued with how to roll that out more broadly as we move through the rest of the year. Again, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we do need to smooth volume out from our peaks in terms of peak days and peak time frames. And certainly, the Buy Online Pick Up In Store option that allows the customer to lock in her sale, but then come and pick it up several days later is a key part of the strategy to do that as we move into the back half. 
In terms of other capabilities, you've heard us talk about our loyalty pilot over the last couple of years. With the onset of the pandemic, we have not rolled that more broadly, but we continue to be intrigued and pleased with the results we're seeing there and do believe that we'll take that out more broadly as we move into fiscal 2020, '21. And we're also looking at other, what I'll call, omnichannel capabilities to, again, more closely integrate our direct channel with our stores channel. And so certainly, all of the tremendous surge in business online has had us accelerate some of the projects that were maybe back burner or further out to be faster, and we're intrigued by some of those opportunities as we move into next year. Nothing additional I would highlight, though, for balance of this year. Hopefully that helps."

It sounds like your curiosity is mostly on the Victoria's Secret side. It's Stuart. So over the last several years, the inventory levels at Victoria's and the need to promote based on consumer response to what we were doing, not being as strong as we would have hoped, has been high, meaning we've been somewhat overbought over the last 2 or 3 years. I'm speaking generally. It's varied some by line of business and by category. 
With that said, the pandemic actually creates a real opportunity for us in the positive sense to make a substantial change in the profile of inventory purchases, which we've outlined. That, in combination with what we do believe as being closer to the customer and delivering better fashion and newness, better merchandising fundamentals around good, better, best, basics with Greg, Amy and John's leadership in those areas as the key merchant leaders in the business. The combination of those things gives us a real reason to believe, along with some focus on getting the cost balance in line, that we've got a real opportunity to deliver good experiences to customers and substantially improve the profitability, the merchandise margin rates in the business. 
Obviously, being appropriately in stock for the customer in core categories and key sizes is a fundamental and something that needs to be. And we will remain very focused on delivering a good experience for her. So we understand the importance of that. We're managing that well. But really the need to fundamentally become much more conservative on the inventory buy or the purchases, again triggered by the pandemic, has a silver lining to it in that it provided a real clarity to the organization about buying much more conservatively and then chasing in the business when the trend was, in fact, there. So that's where we are. We understand that being in stock is important. 
But in terms of overall turn in the business, importantly, in certain categories, we were turning reasonably well or at a level that we're very comfortable with. And in other categories, we had meaningful opportunity to improve the turn in the business. And again, the combination of everything I've just described, I think, is going to get us to a much healthier balance between inventory levels and purchases and the underlying demand. So that's where we're at on. Thanks."

Again, because we don't know -- it's a very wide range of outcomes that are possible. And so we want to be able to absolutely chase to the upside if we're able to continue a trend more like what we've seen year-to-date, but also use our agility as we have historically to also cut back if, in fact, things don't materialize to the level that we would expect them to. 
So as a reminder, the Bath & Body Works supply chain is almost fully a domestic supply chain, and a lot of it is actually produced right here in central Ohio. And so that gives us, again, tremendous flexibility and agility. And allows us to, as you mentioned, really chase into trends. So in our vernacular, maximize winners and minimize losers or things that end up performing worse than our expectations. The ability to do that has been a critical part of our historical success, and we're absolutely relying on it already through the first half of the year because we were surprised to the upside in the second quarter. And so Bath & Body Works had originally cut back pretty substantially on receipts at the beginning of the quarter, but we were able to successfully chase back into receipts through the quarter in order to meet our demand that exceeded our expectations, and we would expect to be able to use that same flexibility and agility in the back half. 
In terms of your question around gifting strategy and specific assembled gift sets versus more open stock gifting. Again, I think it's important to remind everyone that Bath & Body Works is absolutely a gifting destination for customers year round at any point in time. At the height of holiday, probably 50% to 60% of customers claim to be coming in for gifts. Even the rest of the year, that number is in the 30% to 40% range. So year-round gifting is something that we focus on for sure at Bath & Body Works, and we see that as a successful driver of the business. 
As we move into this particular Christmas, I would say, based on several years of testing results around the pros and cons of having assembled gift sets, we certainly have moved over the last couple of years to having fewer, smaller portion of our business in those assembled gift sets. And later, meaning closer to Christmas as opposed to earlier in the holiday season, is when that business really peaks. And so we'll continue to rely on those learnings to impact our flow of assembled gifts in terms of amount and timing. But again, what that does have us focus on then is ensuring that the whole assortment that's available for customers inside of the holiday time frame is giftable and making that as easy as possible for her with things like cellophane wrap available for all customers, ribbons to create gifts. Our associates are happy to create those gifts for you in-store as well as provide you with supplies to do that from home. So gifting in general as much, if not more of a focus this year than it's ever been. Hope that's helpful."

Earlier in this call, we talked about the benefits of a more conservative posture on inventory purchase levels, how aggressive we're buying and how that has an effect on promotional activity. So that's been an important change. It's starting to bear some fruit. I talked about the work that Greg, Amy and John are doing in beauty, PINK, Victoria's, lingerie and the fundamentals that they're pursuing in terms of merchandising fundamentals, easy things to say, but hard to do, really gaining some traction and seeing across all major categories healthy average unit retail growth and meaningful margin rate improvements, which is certainly indication of a better, stronger response from consumers with respect to what we're selling. 
We are implementing a profit improvement plan that we've talked about. A lot of that benefit relates to the Victoria's Secret NewCo business. But with all that said, we got a lot of work in front of us. We're -- the businesses results have declined substantially over the last few years. We're not, in any way, out of touch with reality about where we are. But with that said, and in the spirit of your question, I sense a real stabilization. And with the combination of actions that we're pursuing and that we've talked about, I see the opportunity for that stabilization and then for resuming to a pattern of growth, most importantly at retail in terms of top line and margin dollars, again in combination with the cost-rationalization actions that we've pursued. 
Maybe lastly and a lot into the -- in my response, but it all is -- all these factors matter. Amy has done important work on the PINK brand positioning. John is doing important work on the Victoria's brand positioning. Some of the changes, one might argue have been subtle so far, but we have indication that the consumer is noticing those changes and those are important changes, and there's more to come on both those things. 
So we've got a lot in front of us. Again, we're not confused about where we are. You put that in combination in operating in an environment that's a pandemic, with the effect of closing stores and the earlier conversations around store capacity and so on at holiday. But feeling like the business is stabilizing and that we're creating the platform for growth. So that would be my perspective on Victoria's. Thanks."

In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores opened. So again, to reiterate what those were, ob",561,"Yes. So thank you, Omar. In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores opened. So again, to reiterate what those were, obviously, when you have a very small number of stores open in the early part of the quarter, as a reminder, we -- for Bath & Body Works, started the quarter with only 23 stores reopened in North America. And we gradually increased that number by about 50 a week through May, about a couple of hundred a week through June and then down to about 100 a week through July to get to that essentially fully reopened as we sit here now in mid-August. But as you would expect, when very few stores were reopened and only a couple of stores in each market early in the quarter, we obviously saw a tremendously high comps out of those locations as they were drawing from a multiple store trade radius. 
Obviously, in our categories, too, which is a use-up category, where if you're loyal to our products, whether again that's soap or body care or home fragrance, you tend to, if you're using it every day, go through it in about 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the product category, which means as stores were closed, there was clearly some pent-up demand. And while some customers did move their purchasing online, many customers waited for our stores to reopen. And so we certainly felt some of that impact as we reopened. And then also, as mentioned, obviously, industry-wide, there's a tremendous demand for soap and sanitizers. And so we certainly felt the benefit of being a strong player in that category. 
All of that said, even as stores were opened for a longer period of time. So specifically, stores that opened late in Q1 or early in Q2, by the end of the second quarter, we were still seeing very strong double-digit comps out of those locations. And again, that's what we're looking at and again, building our upside views to assume that -- what would it take to maintain that kind of a trend while also managing to downsides, again, either based on capacity or if there were to be a change in momentum in the business. 
On your question regarding BOPIS, I think maybe it's -- or Buy Online Pick Up In Store, I think it's important to clarify that the capability that I described earlier was specific to Bath & Body Works. That's the only locations right now where we are utilizing that Buy Online Pick Up In Store capability. 
In terms of your question around what do those -- the profile of those transactions look like relative to ""a normal transaction"". Again, when you're buying online, you're doing so through the website and then directing the purchase ultimately to be fulfilled in one of our stores. But the profile of those transactions look very similar to our other online transactions. Our online transactions tend to have a slightly average order -- higher, slightly average order size than our in-store transactions. But in terms of margin or category mix, very similar to a ""normal or average transaction"". So not something that we would think go forward drives a material change. Hope that's helpful."

And what percentage of revenue -- so we understand the foot traffic is at 30% of max capacity. But what percentage of last year's revenue can that low level of traffic capacity deliver in your stores? I would assume that it's materially better than that. But I just wanted to see if you could help us understand how the traffic capacity limits translate into store-only revenues at this level."

So I'll try to directionally answer hopefully in a way that's helpful. So again, when we're speaking in terms of metering traffic or number of customers in the store, the percent capacity that we're talking about there is generally a capacity that's given by local authorities around what would the fire marshal, for example, say, is a safe number of people to have in the store at any point in time. And we've pegged that 30% directionally number due to really looking at what does that allow for in terms of social distancing of associates and customers throughout the store. So obviously, in many days of the week and many times of the year, that's not a problem at all, meaning that even at a 30% capacity, we don't -- that doesn't create a line outside the store at all. But at other times of the year, in the peak of holiday, that's obviously what we're looking at and trying to figure out. 
So in terms of that number itself, we certainly will be continuing to test and monitor. That, again, the priority is safety. So we're not going to make any changes to that if we think that requires us to compromise on safety and social distancing. But certainly, we are continuing to monitor to see if that number is right. 
The other part of your question was around modeling. What does that allow us to do in terms of covering last year revenue? So obviously, in the second quarter, even with those parameters in place and even more stringent parameters in place earlier in the quarter, you saw that, obviously, there was no constraint in terms of our ability to maximize revenue in the stores. Traffic into our locations in the second quarter was down. It was down in the high single-digit range. There was some differentiation of that traffic between mall stores and non-mall stores. It was down more in mall stores. It was actually up in non-mall stores driving a performance differentiation between those locations. But the other parts of the selling equation were up dramatically: so conversion, up in the 30% range; and average dollar sale, up in the 40% to 50% range, so way more than an offset, obviously, to that traffic decline. And we will be relying on those metrics to continue to drive performance as we move into the back half. The combination of those things obviously means that the dollar generated by every footsteps into our store is up dramatically, up basically double to last year, if that's helpful."

Yes. So as we've talked about in some prior calls, the BBW franchised stores around the world outside of North America is a very nice business model, very successful and profitable business model that has seen nice growth over the last several years. Obviously, the pandemic had an impact on that business, just like it had an impact on all of our businesses. But similar to the U.S., the rest of world franchise partners are now largely reopened in terms of locations around the world and also were able to very successfully shift business to online in all of their markets as well. 
So when we think about from a future potential opportunity, again, that franchise model, which is a low-capital, capital-light investment with a lot of potential upside, is something that we absolutely do believe over the next several years we will want to expand further into additional geographies. Because, again, we have seen it perform well essentially everywhere we've gone. 
In terms of specifics around that, again, in the midst of still figuring out 2020 and operating safely, we're not going to speculate on what that will be go forward. But certainly, an important profitable business and one that we do see with growth potential go forward."

First, as outlined in our circulated script in and as Andrew reminded us this morning, we took important steps to create or to facilitate stand-alone companies, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works in the quarter. That was the organizational work that we did, taking many shared functions and creating -- or integrating those functions, I should say, into the respective businesses, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. 
We did retain Goldman and JPMorgan very recently shortly after the end of the quarter. And we'll begin work with them where they'll give the Board and the company advice about the range of alternatives and will assist us in a process as we move forward. 
Obviously, it's important to get a read on holiday results to value the business and to ensure that we strike the right balance in terms of timing, execution risk and getting an appropriate valuation for the business. And what the company is most focused on right now is driving great results at retail. So we got a lot of people in stores, distribution centers, home offices, vendor partners, all kinds of folks organized to provide the best results at retail. And I couldn't be more proud of what this team has done over the last 90 days or so through the organizational work, reopening stores, maximizing volume on the digital channel and the digital channel. So we're very focused on having the best holiday possible. It will be important as we go down this path. And it will be important and put -- as capital markets, advisers, potential buyers, again, the public markets assess the opportunity for Victoria's Secret. So very focused on having a good holiday, have hired some banks and took a lot of important steps to create stand-alone companies. Thanks, Ike."

And as we got more and more stores open through the end of the quarter, finishing with essentially the majority of stores open and sitting here now today in mid-August, we actually have all but about 40 stores reopened. We've continued to see very strong results in both our direct channel and our stores channel. And as we've moved into August, we've seen results continue to be very strong. 
In terms of your question around our future confidence in Bath & Body Works, I would say there are also, we have a lot of belief that our trend should be able to continue as a strong market leader in all of the categories in which we play. As you can imagine, as we've discussed in the past, one of the most critical questions we always ask ourselves is, are we, in fact, in the right categories of business. And are those categories that are still relevant to our customers and growing in the marketplace? And I think it's fair to say that in the case of Bath & Body Works, the answer to that question is a strong yes across our entire portfolio. 
Obviously, the soap and sanitizer business that historically has been 14% to 15% of the business is even more important to our customers and to all of the country right now in the midst of a pandemic. So as expected, we've seen tremendous growth coming out of that category. And while that may moderate over time, we expect that awareness around the importance of that category, washing your hands, using sanitizers when you're not able to wash your hands, will continue even as the pandemic itself hopefully starts to wane away. 
In terms of our other categories, we obviously have a huge and important body care business. That business has always been relevant to our customers, is even more relevant to her today as an affordable luxury, a way for her to treat herself even when she's unable or unwilling to spend money on perhaps other larger-ticket commodities. That is an inexpensive way, whether for self-indulgence or to give as a gift. And then similarly, our important home fragrance business that has grown substantially over the last half decade, also tremendously important to her, both now during the pandemic when we're using our homes as a place of work, a place of teaching and school and a place of refuge and solace. Certainly, making your home smell like you want it to is something that our customer has continued to express interest in and again, something we would expect to continue through the pandemic and also afterwards. So again, bottom line, categories that we're in, very, very relevant today, have been relevant in the past, and we absolutely believe are just as relevant to go forward. Hope that helps."

So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volume",820,"Thanks, Lorraine. So in terms of your question around capacity, again, there's capacity in both of our channels in terms of our stores channel and our direct or online channel. On the online channel, we have obviously been experiencing holiday-like volumes really since the start of the pandemic. And what that has meant is that we have substantially ramped up our fulfillment center capacity even while needing to run those fulfillment centers in a way, as we mentioned earlier, very consistent with our overall focus on safety protocols. And as you might expect, that puts some constraints on throughput and other productivity measures in those centers as we have to apply social distancing and other parameters in those centers. 
That said, we are very pleased with the ramp-up in capacity that we have already achieved in both Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret. And as we move into the back half of the year where volumes continue to grow, we are also on track to increase capacity even further across both networks. So feeling like we're in good shape there. But obviously, anytime there's a concern around an outbreak, that's something we have to monitor and take appropriate actions. And so again, we are cautiously optimistic that we have procured and are using capacity wisely. 
When you think about our stores channel, in some ways, it's a similar constraint in terms of the number of customers that we're able to actually allow into the stores at any point in time in order to, again, be focused on safety as our key priority as well as then our ability to process customers through our cash registers and lines within stores. As we've reopened stores, we started off with -- I'm speaking now for Bath & Body Works, a store opening pilot in late April that put a significant constraint on the number of customers we were allowing into the store early in that process, early on, keeping it at about 10% to 20% of max occupancy. As we move through the second quarter, we got comfortable with our protocols, again, around safety, social distancing, consistent sanitizing of all the surfaces and products within the store on a regular basis. And that allowed us to get comfortable with raising that max occupancy up to about 30%. But that's still going to be an issue as we move into the height of holiday in terms of how many customers do we feel comfortable metering into the store at any point in time. 
Also, in terms of a different cash wrap layout, if you've spent time in our stores, either Victoria's Secret or Bath & Body Works, you'll see that in order to allow for social distancing by our associates, not all cash wraps have been -- or not all cash registers on cash wraps have been able to be utilized. That has caused us to look at more mobile POS cash wraps in order to spread out customers and associates in the back of store to allow for that. So again, we're doing lots of additional testing here in the third quarter to simulate peak volume and understand how will that impact capacity and throughput. But those are really the reasons, Lorraine, for again, the cautious outlook as we move to volume levels in the fourth quarter that, I know you know about our business, are many times 2 to 3 to 4x higher than what we would normally see in the second quarter. 
In terms of incremental costs, as one would expect, putting in place safety parameters and personal protective equipment has certainly come with costs in our stores, and we are happy that we have made those investments and happy that we were able to procure all those supplies in a very efficient way, but that does come with additional costs. We're also seeing costs associated with what it takes to then run stores in this new operating model in terms of the level of labor, in order to keep customers and associates safe, in order to be able to guide customers through the store, in order to be doing the ongoing sanitation of the store and the product, as I mentioned earlier. So that all comes with additional costs. 
And then in other parts of the supply chain, whether it's in our fulfillment centers that we are, again, from a safety standpoint, operating differently, including in some cases paying premium pay in order to procure enough labor as well as, as we look upstream in terms of our base of supply and in terms of our distribution and logistics network. We are seeing some inflationary pressure there on wages in order to procure enough labor. 
So that's at a high level, how I would describe both of those things. Stuart, I don't know if there's any other color you would add either from a VS or a total perspective."

So the store closure activity for Victoria's has been largely complete. Not fully complete, but largely complete. We remain comfortable with the estimate of about 250 stores closing this year in North America. The difference between largely and fully is we have some ongoing dialogue with landlords, property owners, developers on some of these situations. And so not all those -- not all 250 are fully resolved. But again, we remain comfortable with the estimate and an important decision for the business, as you appreciate. 
With respect to sales transfer, as you would also intuit or understand, there is a range of outcomes. We remain comfortable with the 30% to 40%. A portion of that, as the minority portion, call it, 5% I'm generalizing, is going to the digital business, the balance going to nearby stores. As you would understand, the specifics vary by trade area. So a lot of this gets down to shopping patterns, traffic flows, et cetera, in trade areas. It's how we look at it. 
And lastly, Alex, you asked if the roundly 30% to 40% is generally consistent with our past history. And the short answer to that question is, yes, and so we've done more testing on this a year ago. As we got somewhat more aggressive with closures last year, we learned more. We had experience prior to that. But again, what we're seeing is that 30% to 40% range, again, expecting that activity to be EBITDA and profit-neutral as we move through, and we think a healthy thing for the business. We all know what's going on in retailing generally. And for the VS NewCo business, we believe this is an important step, a good step for the long-term health and profitability of the business. So that's where we're at."

So on your first question in terms of the capacity ramp-up, obviously, we are making any and all investments required in order to procure that capacity. That means working with more fulfillment centers than what we had at this time last year or even at the peak of holiday. We're already operating with more centers this year than last year by about 2x, and that magnitude will continue as we move through the rest of the year. 
In terms of the other investments being made into those centers, obviously, I described many of the investments associated with safety and making sure that we have adequate protocols, PPE equipment as well as labor in those stores. Those are really the investments that we'll be making from a capacity standpoint. 
From a -- your question around the percent of sale for Bath & Body Works direct and other capabilities that we're looking to add to the direct business over time. I think it's important to just reground ourselves on where has Bath & Body Works online historically been as a percent of the total business. So it finished 2019 at just under 20% of total revenue for the Bath & Body Works segment but had been growing rapidly over the past several years: over the prior 5 years, compounded average growth rate in the high 20s and the prior 2 years, 2019 and 2018, growing at about 30% per year. So already a large and fast-growing portion of the business. 
That said, as you would have seen in our materials released last night for the spring season to date, the first 6 months of the year, Bath & Body Works direct was about 42% of revenue, obviously, peaking in the time frame that stores were closed. But even as the majority of stores have reopened here through July and into August, the direct business as a percent of sales has continued in the high 20s to 30% range, and that's frankly how we're modeling the business go forward. 
In terms of capability, you would have noticed that we have added the capability of Buy Online Pick Up In Store. That is not something that the business had as a capability prior to second quarter of 2020. We have added that into, at this point, a little over 60 of our locations. 45 of those locations are specifically Buy Online Pick Up In Store, curbside only. That was a model that we were fortunate to have available to us in California when some stores that had reopened were forced to close as a result of governmental and jurisdiction requirements in that state. So we have been able to continue to operate those stores and are pleased with the results we're seeing. Obviously, stores do more volume when they're fully open as opposed to curbside only. But it is a model that has allowed us to continue to serve our customers and associates safely in those environments. 
We do also have about a dozen locations where we have Buy Online Pick Up In Store in addition to being fully open. And we are pleased with those results as well, and we're intrigued with how to roll that out more broadly as we move through the rest of the year. Again, as Stuart mentioned earlier, we do need to smooth volume out from our peaks in terms of peak days and peak time frames. And certainly, the Buy Online Pick Up In Store option that allows the customer to lock in her sale, but then come and pick it up several days later is a key part of the strategy to do that as we move into the back half. 
In terms of other capabilities, you've heard us talk about our loyalty pilot over the last couple of years. With the onset of the pandemic, we have not rolled that more broadly, but we continue to be intrigued and pleased with the results we're seeing there and do believe that we'll take that out more broadly as we move into fiscal 2020, '21. And we're also looking at other, what I'll call, omnichannel capabilities to, again, more closely integrate our direct channel with our stores channel. And so certainly, all of the tremendous surge in business online has had us accelerate some of the projects that were maybe back burner or further out to be faster, and we're intrigued by some of those opportunities as we move into next year. Nothing additional I would highlight, though, for balance of this year. Hopefully that helps."

It sounds like your curiosity is mostly on the Victoria's Secret side. It's Stuart. So over the last several years, the inventory levels at Victoria's and the need to promote based on consumer response to what we were doing, not being as strong as we would have hoped, has been high, meaning we've been somewhat overbought over the last 2 or 3 years. I'm speaking generally. It's varied some by line of business and by category. 
With that said, the pandemic actually creates a real opportunity for us in the positive sense to make a substantial change in the profile of inventory purchases, which we've outlined. That, in combination with what we do believe as being closer to the customer and delivering better fashion and newness, better merchandising fundamentals around good, better, best, basics with Greg, Amy and John's leadership in those areas as the key merchant leaders in the business. The combination of those things gives us a real reason to believe, along with some focus on getting the cost balance in line, that we've got a real opportunity to deliver good experiences to customers and substantially improve the profitability, the merchandise margin rates in the business. 
Obviously, being appropriately in stock for the customer in core categories and key sizes is a fundamental and something that needs to be. And we will remain very focused on delivering a good experience for her. So we understand the importance of that. We're managing that well. But really the need to fundamentally become much more conservative on the inventory buy or the purchases, again triggered by the pandemic, has a silver lining to it in that it provided a real clarity to the organization about buying much more conservatively and then chasing in the business when the trend was, in fact, there. So that's where we are. We understand that being in stock is important. 
But in terms of overall turn in the business, importantly, in certain categories, we were turning reasonably well or at a level that we're very comfortable with. And in other categories, we had meaningful opportunity to improve the turn in the business. And again, the combination of everything I've just described, I think, is going to get us to a much healthier balance between inventory levels and purchases and the underlying demand. So that's where we're at on. Thanks."

Again, because we don't know -- it's a very wide range of outcomes that are possible. And so we want to be able to absolutely chase to the upside if we're able to continue a trend more like what we've seen year-to-date, but also use our agility as we have historically to also cut back if, in fact, things don't materialize to the level that we would expect them to. 
So as a reminder, the Bath & Body Works supply chain is almost fully a domestic supply chain, and a lot of it is actually produced right here in central Ohio. And so that gives us, again, tremendous flexibility and agility. And allows us to, as you mentioned, really chase into trends. So in our vernacular, maximize winners and minimize losers or things that end up performing worse than our expectations. The ability to do that has been a critical part of our historical success, and we're absolutely relying on it already through the first half of the year because we were surprised to the upside in the second quarter. And so Bath & Body Works had originally cut back pretty substantially on receipts at the beginning of the quarter, but we were able to successfully chase back into receipts through the quarter in order to meet our demand that exceeded our expectations, and we would expect to be able to use that same flexibility and agility in the back half. 
In terms of your question around gifting strategy and specific assembled gift sets versus more open stock gifting. Again, I think it's important to remind everyone that Bath & Body Works is absolutely a gifting destination for customers year round at any point in time. At the height of holiday, probably 50% to 60% of customers claim to be coming in for gifts. Even the rest of the year, that number is in the 30% to 40% range. So year-round gifting is something that we focus on for sure at Bath & Body Works, and we see that as a successful driver of the business. 
As we move into this particular Christmas, I would say, based on several years of testing results around the pros and cons of having assembled gift sets, we certainly have moved over the last couple of years to having fewer, smaller portion of our business in those assembled gift sets. And later, meaning closer to Christmas as opposed to earlier in the holiday season, is when that business really peaks. And so we'll continue to rely on those learnings to impact our flow of assembled gifts in terms of amount and timing. But again, what that does have us focus on then is ensuring that the whole assortment that's available for customers inside of the holiday time frame is giftable and making that as easy as possible for her with things like cellophane wrap available for all customers, ribbons to create gifts. Our associates are happy to create those gifts for you in-store as well as provide you with supplies to do that from home. So gifting in general as much, if not more of a focus this year than it's ever been. Hope that's helpful."

Earlier in this call, we talked about the benefits of a more conservative posture on inventory purchase levels, how aggressive we're buying and how that has an effect on promotional activity. So that's been an important change. It's starting to bear some fruit. I talked about the work that Greg, Amy and John are doing in beauty, PINK, Victoria's, lingerie and the fundamentals that they're pursuing in terms of merchandising fundamentals, easy things to say, but hard to do, really gaining some traction and seeing across all major categories healthy average unit retail growth and meaningful margin rate improvements, which is certainly indication of a better, stronger response from consumers with respect to what we're selling. 
We are implementing a profit improvement plan that we've talked about. A lot of that benefit relates to the Victoria's Secret NewCo business. But with all that said, we got a lot of work in front of us. We're -- the businesses results have declined substantially over the last few years. We're not, in any way, out of touch with reality about where we are. But with that said, and in the spirit of your question, I sense a real stabilization. And with the combination of actions that we're pursuing and that we've talked about, I see the opportunity for that stabilization and then for resuming to a pattern of growth, most importantly at retail in terms of top line and margin dollars, again in combination with the cost-rationalization actions that we've pursued. 
Maybe lastly and a lot into the -- in my response, but it all is -- all these factors matter. Amy has done important work on the PINK brand positioning. John is doing important work on the Victoria's brand positioning. Some of the changes, one might argue have been subtle so far, but we have indication that the consumer is noticing those changes and those are important changes, and there's more to come on both those things. 
So we've got a lot in front of us. Again, we're not confused about where we are. You put that in combination in operating in an environment that's a pandemic, with the effect of closing stores and the earlier conversations around store capacity and so on at holiday. But feeling like the business is stabilizing and that we're creating the platform for growth. So that would be my perspective on Victoria's. Thanks."

In our prepared remarks last night, we talked a little bit about what were the factors that we thought certainly helped benefit the strong positive comps that we did see as stores opened. So again, to reiterate what those were, obviously, when you have a very small number of stores open in the early part of the quarter, as a reminder, we -- for Bath & Body Works, started the quarter with only 23 stores reopened in North America. And we gradually increased that number by about 50 a week through May, about a couple of hundred a week through June and then down to about 100 a week through July to get to that essentially fully reopened as we sit here now in mid-August. But as you would expect, when very few stores were reopened and only a couple of stores in each market early in the quarter, we obviously saw a tremendously high comps out of those locations as they were drawing from a multiple store trade radius. 
Obviously, in our categories, too, which is a use-up category, where if you're loyal to our products, whether again that's soap or body care or home fragrance, you tend to, if you're using it every day, go through it in about 4 to 8 weeks, depending on the product category, which means as stores were closed, there was clearly some pent-up demand. And while some customers did move their purchasing online, many customers waited for our stores to reopen. And so we certainly felt some of that impact as we reopened. And then also, as mentioned, obviously, industry-wide, there's a tremendous demand for soap and sanitizers. And so we certainly felt the benefit of being a strong player in that category. 
All of that said, even as stores were opened for a longer period of time. So specifically, stores that opened late in Q1 or early in Q2, by the end of the second quarter, we were still seeing very strong double-digit comps out of those locations. And again, that's what we're looking at and again, building our upside views to assume that -- what would it take to maintain that kind of a trend while also managing to downsides, again, either based on capacity or if there were to be a change in momentum in the business. 
On your question regarding BOPIS, I think maybe it's -- or Buy Online Pick Up In Store, I think it's important to clarify that the capability that I described earlier was specific to Bath & Body Works. That's the only locations right now where we are utilizing that Buy Online Pick Up In Store capability. 
In terms of your question around what do those -- the profile of those transactions look like relative to ""a normal transaction"". Again, when you're buying online, you're doing so through the website and then directing the purchase ultimately to be fulfilled in one of our stores. But the profile of those transactions look very similar to our other online transactions. Our online transactions tend to have a slightly average order -- higher, slightly average order size than our in-store transactions. But in terms of margin or category mix, very similar to a ""normal or average transaction"". So not something that we would think go forward drives a material change. Hope that's helpful."

So I'll try to directionally answer hopefully in a way that's helpful. So again, when we're speaking in terms of metering traffic or number of customers in the store, the percent capacity that we're talking about there is generally a capacity that's given by local authorities around what would the fire marshal, for example, say, is a safe number of people to have in the store at any point in time. And we've pegged that 30% directionally number due to really looking at what does that allow for in terms of social distancing of associates and customers throughout the store. So obviously, in many days of the week and many times of the year, that's not a problem at all, meaning that even at a 30% capacity, we don't -- that doesn't create a line outside the store at all. But at other times of the year, in the peak of holiday, that's obviously what we're looking at and trying to figure out. 
So in terms of that number itself, we certainly will be continuing to test and monitor. That, again, the priority is safety. So we're not going to make any changes to that if we think that requires us to compromise on safety and social distancing. But certainly, we are continuing to monitor to see if that number is right. 
The other part of your question was around modeling. What does that allow us to do in terms of covering last year revenue? So obviously, in the second quarter, even with those parameters in place and even more stringent parameters in place earlier in the quarter, you saw that, obviously, there was no constraint in terms of our ability to maximize revenue in the stores. Traffic into our locations in the second quarter was down. It was down in the high single-digit range. There was some differentiation of that traffic between mall stores and non-mall stores. It was down more in mall stores. It was actually up in non-mall stores driving a performance differentiation between those locations. But the other parts of the selling equation were up dramatically: so conversion, up in the 30% range; and average dollar sale, up in the 40% to 50% range, so way more than an offset, obviously, to that traffic decline. And we will be relying on those metrics to continue to drive performance as we move into the back half. The combination of those things obviously means that the dollar generated by every footsteps into our store is up dramatically, up basically double to last year, if that's helpful."

So when we think about from a future potential opportunity, again, that franchise model, which is a low-capital, capital-light investment with a lot of potential upside, is something that we absolutely do believe over the next several years we will want to expand further into additional geographies. Because, again, we have seen it perform well essentially everywhere we've gone. 
In terms of specifics around that, again, in the midst of still figuring out 2020 and operating safely, we're not going to speculate on what that will be go forward. But certainly, an important profitable business and one that we do see with growth potential go forward."

Directionally, that business last year, on an annual basis, was 14% of the business. In the first half of the year last year was in that same 14% to 15% of the business range. And this year, in Q1, it was about 25% of the business. And in Q2, a little higher than that. 
But in terms of percent of transactions, I don't think that's something we historically have talked about. But safe to say that customer engagement into that category has been very high. And so as it's grown as a percent of sales, it's seen a comparable growth in terms of customership into that category and certainly a business that we remain very bullish on into the future."
