Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of",2310,"Thanks, Matt, and hello to everyone on the call. Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of our geographies and categories. But let's take a step back, we're living in an unprecedented moment. And like never before, each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we will respond. So let me tell you what we've seen over the past 2 months.
When COVID-19 began to aggressively spread across China in late January, our top priority was to protect the health and safety of our teammates and our consumers. We immediately began closing stores. As of 45 days ago, we had closed more than 5,000 stores in Greater China while the remaining open doors are operating with severely reduced hours. Not surprisingly, retail volume in China plummeted but we acted quickly and decisively, leveraging our diverse sourcing base and digital capabilities to manage the business with flexibility and shifting our inventory to serve consumer digital demand.
At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network to inspire and support consumers across China to stay active and connected while at home. As a result, our Nike Training Club workouts in China saw an extraordinary rise in sign up and engagement. In fact, our weekly active users for all of our Nike activity apps were up 80% by the end of Q3 versus the beginning of the quarter. And here's what happened. The strong engagement of Chinese consumers with our activity apps translated into strong engagement with our NIKE commerce app. As a result, our digital business in China grew more than 30% and maintained strong momentum throughout this challenging period. A powerful statement of NIKE's agile problem-solving in times of disruption.
Then approximately 30 days ago, we began to gradually reopen stores in China. People got back to work, and retail traffic began improving significantly. Today, nearly 80% of our stores in China have reopened, with more coming back online every day. In fact, just last week, we reopened our first store in the Wuhan area. And the results are encouraging. Our digital business in China has accelerated even further over the past month, and we are now seeing double-digit increases in retail traffic week-over-week with some stores having already returned to prior year levels. Credit for this response goes to Angela Dong, who leads our Greater China geography and her talented team of more than 1,600. I spoke with Angela 2 nights ago, and she has been telling me about the positive sentiment consumers in China are feeling for NIKE, and I can't overstate how impressed I am. It's become quite clear to me that when NIKE says, we are a brand of China for China, it's really true. And it's no surprise to see the business already rebounding given the depth of our connection and the incredible strength of our local leadership team.
So today, I can say that we're seeing the other side of the crisis in China. And due to the resilience and creativity of our team in China, we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere. In addition to Greater China, we've applied that playbook in Japan and South Korea over the past 2 months, and we're seeing early momentum in those markets as well. And with COVID-19 now spreading across Europe and the U.S., we are applying the same playbook. We have prioritized the health and safety of our teammates, and we have closed our stores. Over the weekend, we drove a strong digital marketing campaign to engage consumers across Europe and across the U.S. to stay healthy and connected while they're at home. And our digital commerce remains open and in growth mode, supported by our teammates in our distribution centers.
We also know that this is a moment in society where the private sector has a major role to play. Companies like NIKE need to do our part. So our teams in innovation and manufacturing are exploring designs for personal protective equipment, or PPE, to support doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of this outbreak. Based on these identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health and Science University, our teammates are working right now about how to best help, including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others. It's been so energizing to see the quick strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need.
That said, we expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period for those living in the U.S. and Europe. And I can't precisely predict how long the containment phase of the outbreak will last. But our experience in China, Japan and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future. And I can assure you this, as the situation continues to evolve, we will be ready, and we will respond. We'll be guided by our values, and we will execute with empathy and with decisiveness.
For instance, we will continue to maintain pay continuity even while our facilities are closed or have altered schedules. We know that our people are vital to fueling our deep connections with consumers, whether they work in our stores or our distribution centers. And what's more, it's simply the right thing to do. So while this is an uncertain and challenging time, NIKE has the foundation in place to emerge from it stronger than ever. Thanks to our competitive advantages, the power of our brand in connection with consumers, our digital capabilities, our compelling product innovation and most importantly, our extraordinary team, we will manage our business back to full recovery. We know in times like these that strong brands get even stronger. And I truly believe that no one is better equipped than NIKE to navigate the current climate. 
So with that said, let's go a bit deeper. I spent the last 9 days digging into this extraordinary company. I thought I knew NIKE after 5 years on the board, but believe me, when you get to dive even deeper, this place is even more impressive than I imagined. Let me walk you through what I've learned through the lens of the 4 strengths I just mentioned: our strong brand, our digital advantage, our product innovation and our extraordinary team. These are the strengths that will continue to set us apart, and these are the strengths that will allow us to shape the future marketplace going forward. 
Since I started as CEO in January, I have visited with our teams in several of our key cities, experiencing firsthand our deep connections with local consumers around the world as well as our innovative retail concepts. I've also had the opportunity to meet with many of our most important strategic partners. During my first week as CEO in early January, I spent time in China and Japan before the virus took hold. I got to see firsthand just how deeply the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands are connecting with consumers, both in compelling retail executions and in the many ways that NIKE partners with regional local governments to grow physical activity in sports. Our brand is driving these powerful connections to consumers worldwide. In fact, we were the #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in Q3, and we continue to gain market share in key cities, such as Berlin, Mexico City and Tokyo.
And during a time of physical store closures around the world, we know that our digital foundation will help us emerge out of the situation in an even stronger position. For instance, in Q3, digital delivered 36% currency-neutral growth, and it will continue to be a powerful driver of our deep consumer connections. As I mentioned early, we are executing our learnings from China about fueling sport and fitness all over the world. We're using our digital advantage to connect with and support our consumers as behaviors around staying healthy at home continue to evolve.
Over the weekend, we made the NTC premium free for everyone in the U.S. for 90 days. NTC premium offers the best on-demand workouts and expert tips from our master trainers and others as well as inspiration and support for healthy living. Digital remains our fastest-growing channel, with owned and partnered digital already representing more than 20% of our overall business. And our apps continue to be the sharp point of our growth. With the Nike App growing revenue close to triple digits once again in Q3, fueling member acquisition and strong monthly engagement. And while we've driven impressive results in acquiring new members, engaging them and fueling increased digital demand, we know that the opportunity here is still far greater than what we've realized to date, and will become an even greater advantage for NIKE as we move forward.
And even while our stores remain closed in Europe and the U.S., we continue to work on defining the future of seamless physical and digital retail. To expand the advantage we have in digital, we continue to invest in our NIKE Direct businesses, enhancing rich experiences like those in the Nike App at Retail. And we are increasingly concentrating on our online to off-line journey, and accelerating our work to fully connect the marketplace while creating frictionless experiences for consumers throughout the world.
Another clear competitive advantage is our product innovation. Our product and innovation have always set NIKE apart from others, and I firmly believe this will become even more important of a differentiator as we look ahead. Over the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with our innovation, design, product and merchandising teams. I've done several deep dives in these areas, and I am truly blown away. As a Board member, you get to see a lot but you can never fully understand how impressive NIKE's product innovation capability is until you spend time with our teams.
For instance, today, we have more than 1,000 designers working at NIKE, with broad and deep talent across footwear and apparel. And you can just feel how their creativity and vision for product inspires everyone here and inspires consumers around the world. I got to see some of this innovative product on display at the NIKE 2020 Forum last month in New York, which served as a great illustration of the power of our 2x Innovation offense. There, we announced a powerful array of breakthrough product, such as our Next% footwear line which offers measurable benefits to consumers. We also launched a new aesthetic for sustainability where we're delivering new scalable platforms like no one else. And by bringing together athletes and creative partners as only NIKE can, the forum was an optimistic statement about the future of sport culture.
And our advantage goes beyond our incredible product pipeline. It has become even more clear to me why NIKE leads the industry our innovation, product and design teams have an unrelenting commitment to discovering what's next. This culture of innovation is pervasive across our organization and deeply embedded within NIKE teams around the world. From those who engage consumers at retail, to those creating the next wave of digital experiences that connect with consumers daily. Fueled by data and analytics capabilities, we are equipped with deep consumer insight that we combine with our design expertise and athlete research. This process directly translates into breakthrough product season after season, allowing us to drive more separation in the marketplace.
There's one last thing I'd like to mention. As you know, the organized sports world remains on hold. And yes, the global culture of health and wellness continues unabated. In fact, in many ways, people are looking to health and wellness now more than ever. Whether it's to stay in shape at home or with a focus on mental health in stressful times, people all over the globe are finding ways to make sport a daily habit wherever, whenever and however they can. And as you may have seen, this past weekend, we encouraged consumers worldwide to work out at home with a simple message: play inside, play for the world.
We're seeing new behaviors normalize in countries all over the globe, and we're shifting our entire consumer ecosystem to deliver access to sports that speaks to consumers' changing lives. Across key markets, we're working to create shared experiences and opportunity for virtual participation, connecting people to something bigger and showing how sport can inspire. And though there's no predicting when organized sports will restart when our athletes, teams and leagues can return to competition, I do have one guarantee. When the gates reopen, when the first whistle sounds, the energy is going to be off the charts. The world's passion for sports remains undiminished. And when it all returns, NIKE will be right there with sports fans everywhere.
In summary, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q3. And amidst unprecedented conditions across the globe, we are staying focused on not simply managing through this situation but taking the actions that will allow us to emerge from it even stronger than before. We know it won't be easy, but NIKE is better prepared than anyone else to regain that momentum, extend our brand leadership and reshape the future marketplace.
NIKE has a long history of rising to the occasion in extraordinary times to deliver strong results and effect extraordinary change in the world of sport and beyond. And that's what we're going to do once again.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy."

Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people, ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the business decisions we're making.
We have a -- in NIKE, we win as a team. And I can tell you that the resilience, strength, empathy and creativity of our teammates has never been on greater display. Our team has always been Nike's greatest advantage. On that note, I want to congratulate 1 of my teammates, Matt Friend, on his new role going forward. Matt and I have worked closely together since he joined NIKE 11 years ago. He's been a great thought partner to me over that time, and we're working seamlessly together through this transition. As I move into my new role with NIKE, I could not be more confident in Nike's financial management with Matt as our CFO.
So as we close Q3 and look ahead, we see 3 key themes. First, as we enter these challenging circumstances, NIKE's brand leadership and business momentum have been stronger than ever and unrivaled around the world. In Q3, we delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth overall, led by 13% growth in both EMEA and APLA. NIKE Greater China was also on pace to deliver another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth prior to the impact of COVID-19. And in North America, our strong mid-single-digit reported rate of revenue growth would have been roughly 3 points higher if not for noncomparable items, including the sale of Hurley and our shift to a licensed business model with fanatics relative to the NFL. While those transactions had a negative impact on our year-over-year revenue growth comparisons, they also result in higher profitability for NIKE.
Across all of our geographies and Converse, digital remained our fastest-growing channel, growing 36% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, each of our geographies and Converse exceeded 30% digital revenue growth in the quarter. Our growth was also broad based across categories as well as across women's and men's, all fueled by innovation platforms and power franchises such as the Air Max 270, the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. Our launch of the Air Jordan 11 brand was the largest in our history with the product selling out in 28 minutes powered by the SNKRS App. In fact, the Jordan Brand grew double digits globally in the quarter.
The LeBron 17, -- and the C edition NBA jerseys fueled basketball's strong growth. And in running, we unveiled our most advanced performance running shoe ever, the AlphaFly Next%. We also launched the new Infinity React designed to help runners run longer, and we've seen very strong sell through, particularly with women.
Apparel also fueled growth in the quarter, growing faster than footwear with double-digit apparel growth in our sportswear, training, basketball, women's and kids categories.
Setting aside the noncash nonrecurring charges related to our business model changes in South America, NIKE, Inc.'s earnings exceeded the earnings that were implied in the financial guidance we provided 90 days ago. We were able to deliver that strong bottom line performance, even including the impact of COVID-19 on Greater China.
The second key theme as we look ahead, relates to how we're addressing the evolving implications of COVID-19. As John said, we are executing on an operational playbook focused on positioning NIKE for an expedited return to profitable, capital-efficient growth. We see each of our markets progressing through a time series that begins with the country addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by 3 phases from a business perspective: one, a recovery period, including, for example, the ramp-up of store reopenings; two, a period of normalization across consumer demand and supply; and three, a period in which we return to strong growth.
Why are we so confident in our approach? As John said, our team in Greater China has given us a playbook for the rest of the world. Based upon the most recent trends we see today, NIKE Greater China has already progressed through the recovery phase, and is now transitioning into the normalization phase. Specifically, we are seeing accelerating strong double-digit, approaching triple-digit growth in our NIKE Digital business. At the same time, roughly 80% of our 7,000 brick-and-mortar NIKE-owned and partner stores are now open. Based on the latest trends in our business, NIKE Greater China Q4 revenue will likely be roughly flat versus Q4 of fiscal year '19.
We're also executing on this playbook in Japan and Korea. Both markets are entering the normalization phase fueled by strong digital growth and significant week-over-week increases in retail traffic and demand for NIKE. Based on what we're experiencing in China, Korea and Japan, we are optimistic. At the same time, this has become a global pandemic. Each country is addressing COVID-19 differently. And accordingly, our markets will progress through the 3 phases from a business perspective on different time lines. That adds some complexity from a global point of view. So we're also executing against a top-down enterprise-wide operational plan.
Our top-down plan includes: one, tight cost management; and two, daily global demand and supply optimization. Accordingly, our Q4 SG&A will be lower than prior year Q4 spending. We're also taking decisive action with respect to supply on a global basis, while shifting our distribution focus to digital in the face of temporary retail store closures. As a result, Q4 fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '21 year-over-year revenue, margin and inventory growth rates will neither be intuitive nor linear. Our measures of success in the near term will be rooted in the amount of inventory on-hand relative to the pace of digital demand, store reopenings and traffic patterns.
Now going into this, we were fortunately experiencing a very strong pull market for NIKE globally, with some of the highest rates of full-price sell-through we've ever experienced. So we're now aggressively managing all of our operating levers to ensure that we expedite NIKE's return to that strong full market. Realigning supply and demand is our focus operationally.
We're also executing this plan leveraging 2 of NIKE's long-standing and greatest competitive advantages: first, Nike's financial strength.  Liquidity will not be an issue for NIKE. In order to ensure resilience during challenging times, we have long maintained a strong balance sheet, a strong investment-grade credit rating and ample access to capital. All coupled with strong operating cash flow generation. NIKE's liquidity and access to capital affords us the ability to be principled, for example, with respect to pay continuity and decisive relative to real-time supply and demand management. 
Second, we have forged the strongest partnerships across the value chain in this industry. That includes, among others, our marketplace partners like Top Sports, -- and Tmall in China as well as Foot Locker, Dick's, JD and Zalando across the U.S. and Europe. Of course, we also have long-standing partnerships that span decades with manufacturers such as --, Shenzhou, -- and many others. We're working closely with all of these strategic partners on a daily basis. Our partners recognize that the stronger NIKE is going forward, the stronger they are. Of course, NIKE is not operating in isolation. External factors will continue to be dynamic, and we will continue to adjust our execution accordingly. 
The third key theme is we look forward. While the setbacks from a business perspective will be significant for all, NIKE will come back even stronger as a brand and as a company. Consumer behavior is changing real time. We're all witnessing new normals emerge in terms of both how consumers shop and stay active. Sport is being redefined as much broader than competition as the world finds new and creative ways to stay healthy and fit. And NIKE's digital ecosystem is keeping us connected real time. From a marketplace perspective, Nike digital growth is accelerating amidst these dynamics.
From a digital capability perspective, the investments we've made to date are now proving to be the foundation for our resilience amidst challenge, and they will be strength as we emerge. For example, we're leveraging select team and tools to dynamically model demand, pricing, planning and allocation; we're leveraging our NIKE membership platform and NIKE mobile app ecosystem to Inspire and enable people to be active at home, while also providing targeted product offers and services to consumers. And the foundation we've built in enterprise data and analytics is fueling our more agile end-to-end execution.
As we've said, we're still in the early innings of NIKE's digital transformation. But the capabilities we've already been building for the future are proving to be the strongest pillars within our business today. As John said, simply put these are times in which strong brands get stronger, and we're confident that NIKE will come back stronger than ever.
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. -- Q3 revenue grew 5%, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong balanced growth across EMEA, APLA, North America and Greater China prior to the impact of COVID-19, all fueled by Nike digital growing 36% versus prior year. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points in Q3 as higher average selling prices and better off-price margin were offset by the impact of COVID-19 primarily in Greater China as we managed inventory sell-through in that market. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX headwinds and incremental tariffs in North America.
SG&A grew 6% in Q3. We continue to invest in our digital transformation, while also beginning to more tightly manage operating overhead and shift demand creation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 3.9% compared to 14.7% for the same period last year due to a shift in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and increased benefits from discrete items.
Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.53, including the $0.25 noncash nonrecurring FX-related charge associated with the transition of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic distributor models.
As of February 29, inventories were up 7% compared to the prior period reflecting healthy full-price versus off-price mix prior to the impacts of COVID-19. With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments.
In North America, Q3 revenue grew 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, which again would have been approximately 3 points higher adjusting for the sale of Hurley and our partnership with Fanatics regarding the NFL business. In Q3, NIKE Digital grew over 30% and the Nike App grew over 60% in North America. New York City and LA each grew double digits, fueled by differentiated Nike consumer experiences. As an example, in L.A., we launched our newest NIKE Live concept store in Glendale, which blew passed our expectations, and significantly -- in terms of the women's business.
Now as of today, we've closed our own stores in North America. Going forward, we will reopen stores on a location-by-location basis as we closely monitor developments. At the same time, NIKE's digital demand has been extraordinary, with Nike Digital Commerce sales over just the past few days approaching holiday peak levels, growing triple digits over just the past week. We have maintained operations in our distribution centers, implementing social distancing and reduced staffing, while focusing on the shipment of digital orders.
Now let's turn to EMEA, where we continue to build on our extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit growth in most key categories. Women's growth strongly outpaced men's, apparel accelerated faster than footwear and digital was up over 40%. The NIKE Brand has never been stronger in EMEA. In every key city in EMEA, consumers rated NIKE their #1 favorite and cool brand.
We also gained significant market share in Q3 across both footwear and apparel, driving further brand separation. Greater speed and agility also fueled our growth and share gains in EMEA in Q3, with over 30% of EMEA revenue and nearly 80% of EMEA incremental growth flowing through our Express Lane. In order to help limit the spread of COVID-19, we have also closed our own stores in Western Europe and select Eastern European markets. And similar to the U.S., we will reopen on a location-by-location basis based on developments.
NIKE Digital continues to grow versus prior year, and we're maintaining operations in our distribution centers, again, shifting their focus towards digital distribution.
In our APLA geography, revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by our key cities and was balanced across key categories, nearly all of which were up double digits. The Jordan Brand, in particular, was incredibly strong in APLA, growing nearly 50% in the quarter, with new innovation like the Jordan Max 200, along with fresh new approaches to Jordan icons all resonating with consumers.
In performance running, our accelerating momentum continued. Especially in Japan, where we dominated the Hakone -- competitive race, seeing a record 84% of participants wearing NIKE. The energy around running in Japan is being fueled by the Vaporfly Next% as well as a halo effect that is impacting other performance models like the Zoomfly, -- and Peg Turbo, which all grew triple digits in Q3.
NIKE Digital grew 51%, and wholesale grew double digits overall on a currency-neutral basis as business with our differentiated strategic partners grew 5x as fast as undifferentiated distribution. As we've said, APLA is our more diverse geography, so we are seeing the impact of COVID-19 vary significantly across Asian and Latin American countries. With that, let's turn to Greater China. 
While our full quarter results in Greater China were significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is worth providing some dimension. Our momentum in China continued to be extraordinary through mid-January. Our revenue growth was on track to exceed the expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by NIKE Digital. We launched the Nike App in China in Q3, and today, we already have 5 million Nike App downloads. And as John said, we're also seeing a spike in weekly average users on our activity apps as we inspire and enable consumers to engage in sport at home. 
We're now, as I said, through the recovery phase and into the normalization period in China. Today, our digital commerce growth continues to accelerate, with triple-digit growth in demand just this last week. Most of our stores and our partner stores are open; retail traffic is significantly accelerating week-over-week; and we're beginning to see a decline from the peak inventory levels we experienced. We are confident that NIKE Greater China is on track to return to growth in fiscal year '21.
As we look ahead, we will not be providing financial guidance for Q4 due to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19. For fiscal year '21, we have been planning performance in line with our long-term financial model. The year-over-year growth rate base comparisons will no longer be meaningful. So we'll share the approach that we're taking with respect to fiscal year '21 on our next earnings call.
All of that said, we are confident that executing our operational plan will position NIKE for a return to profitable capital-efficient growth. That will happen over time as each country addresses COVID-19 at a different pace. But our confidence in the return to growth is founded on the relatively rapid recovery and early signs of normalization we are already seeing in China, Korea and Japan.
In these challenging times, NIKE's competitive advantages are showing up as extraordinary resilience. As we emerge from these challenges, those same competitive advantages will show up as strength and brand distinction. Those unique strengths include Nike's deep authentic connection to consumers, our pipeline of innovative products, our financial strength and capacity, our industry-leading digital capabilities, our strong partnerships and most importantly, our talented and committed teams around the world. I would not trade NIKE's team or position with anybody.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Why don't I take the first part of the question. Maybe Andy, take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports professional sports leagues and now the Olympics have put things on hold. And they're doing, I think, wha",390,"Sure, Bob. It's John. Why don't I take the first part of the question. Maybe Andy, take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports professional sports leagues and now the Olympics have put things on hold. And they're doing, I think, what's appropriate by prioritizing the health and safety of their athletes and fans, and we're very supportive of that. And we look forward to when organized sport will be back and running and when they are, we'll be there. But I think it's important to separate those sporting events and our innovation pipeline because we will continue to move forward in our innovation pipeline. And as I said earlier, we're very excited about the products in that pipeline and the products. We're introducing, in fact, more excited than perhaps any time before. And while we announced some of these products around the Olympics, if the Olympics gets deferred for a year, we can still launch them on our timing. So 2 specific examples. As you know, the Next% performance running line will allow runners of all abilities to have the same technology and measurable benefits of the Alphafly Next% percent that the world's leading marathoners have. And we can launch that when the time is right unrelated to the Olympics. Similarly, some of the sustainability product we announced at the forum, the VaporMax 2020, which utilizes 75% recycled manufacturing waste or the -- line, which is an innovative way to have low carbon footprint footwear. We can launch when the time is right, when we get to the recovery normalization periods. And so consumer demand for those things is strong and will continue to be strong. And so we simply are going to move ahead with our product pipeline at the right moments in the right ways.
I'll just make 1 small final example before turning it over to Andy. In China, we got creative and we took a couple of launches that were scheduled in February and made them digital-only launches. So the Air Jordan retro IOG and the Air Jordan 5 retro, we made digital-only launches in a world where stores are closed and -- but digital demand is strong. So we're going to proceed full speed ahead with that product pipeline.  Do you want to talk about the second part of the question?"

I'd just say just to summarize some of what both John and I said in the remarks and John just reiterated, we came into the circumstances in an incredibly strong position. Some of the highest full price sell-through we've seen. Inventory's really healthy. As we go forward, we recognize that there will be some promotion in the marketplace. But as John said, we've also got an amazing pipeline of innovative and compelling fresh products. And what we'll be doing is working on the timing of the launch of those products and the flow of those products over time, so that while we're working through energy and we're working through inventory we're also bringing distinctive energy to the market and to consumers. You asked about our license business. Just for context, our license business is a very low single-digit percentage of our overall business. We'll have some impact on that business. I'd say, just keep in mind that a lot of these elite sporting activities or events are being postponed versus necessarily canceled. Although some of them have been canceled. But one of the things we recognize around here is our product -- some of our product has a little bit longer life cycle. And come fall, we think we could be kicking off one of the greatest years in sports history.
Now you also asked about SG&A. So from an SG&A perspective, the short answer is we've got quite a bit of flexibility within our SG&A, and that's one of the reasons you saw us deliver profitability even in Q3 when we were all a bit taken off guard by the significant impact of COVID-19, we were still able to deliver profitability that exceeded the guidance we set 90 days ago. As I also mentioned, based on some quick and agile work across our cross-functional teams, we see SG&A in Q4 declining versus prior year. There's quite a bit of flexibility in demand creation. And actually, it ties back to your question about sport. As John mentioned in his remarks, we've done some really creative things from a digital connectivity perspective with huge impact. So quick, low cost, extraordinary impact. And we think within demand creation, we can save quite a bit of our powder for the return to sport that we see within fiscal year '21.
Within SG&A, our liquidity and our access to capital allows us within SG&A to stay very principled. So continued pay continuity, as John talked about. And at the same time, continuing to invest in those things that even now more than ever, we see as differentiators long term, albeit, we'll do it in a more focused way. So beyond that, there are quite a bit of opportunities with operating overhead and CapEx. And when I said our team has just been amazing in terms of their resilience and creativity, it actually includes in terms of tightly managing our cost."

So one of the real advantages, as you said, of NIKE being a scaled global company is we can extract learning and insight from each of our markets. And so here's what we've seen, just to quickly recap what Andy and I talked about. We're looking at things through the lens of 4 phases to this. Containment of the outbreak, first; second recovery period when stores reopen; third, normalization when things get back to growth from the prior year; and then fourth, return to growth. And the data from actually China, Japan and Korea was fairly consistent. Containment took 5 to 6 weeks. Stores were closed but the e-commerce growth in all 3 markets remained strong during that time, augmented by NIKE connecting with consumers around being active while at home. Now all 3 markets are through what we're calling recovery, that is retail is opening back up. Consumers are back on the streets. And we're seeing, as we move into normalization, retail traffic is coming back. Consumers are in the stores. They're engaged. They're often wearing base masks but they're back on the street. Interestingly, digital has accelerated even more since the stores have been open. Again, I think point to this blended digital versus physical experience is a thing of the past. Consumers don't think in those terms. So I bring a sort of  consumer technology lens, where we learned that consumers want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. And they don't think about, I'm going to make a digital purchase or a physical purchase. A consumer may often start shopping on their mobile device, they may go into a store and have it shipped at home, they may order online and pick it up in a store. And what we're seeing in Japan, China and Korea is that seamless digital-physical experience is responding to what consumers want.
And I might note business comes back in those 3 markets were outperforming our competition, consistent with a mantra of ensuring that we come through this period in an even stronger position and extend our leadership position. So in the U.S., obviously, we're in much -- we're earlier in the cycle. We've closed the stores. We're taking care of our employees. We digitally connected with consumers over the weekend around health and their activity. So our brand is present day in and day out with them. As Andy mentioned, we're seeing very strong digital growth, even in the dark days. And we're managing our inventory so that we can be ready when recovery comes. We can't -- none of us can't predict perfectly how long the containment phase is going to take in the U.S. and Europe. But what we can know is when stores stop reopening -- or -- are closed, we're going to be there digitally. We're going to be there digital with activity apps and commerce. And when the stores start reopening, we're going to be leveraging our strengths, our unique strengths with strong compelling product, a digital connection with consumers that is unmatched, these seamless digital and physical experiences at both NIKE Direct and our partners. We're working very closely with our partners. And in fact, in the last 3 days, and I've talked to the CEO of Zalando, JD, Foot Locker in the last couple of months, met with DICK's CEO, the CEOs of our 2 Chinese partners, we're working together to be ready when things recover and then our brand. So I think it's going to accelerate what was already going to happen with digital transformation. Consumers will continue. Digital is a more prominent role in their lives. You'll see more digital growth. And I think the shape of the future marketplace where differentiated retail thrives on differentiated retail struggles. That will simply be accelerated. So we intend to drive both."

And so -- and we engage with them both around their physical stores and around online. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with the CEO of Zalando who is obviously a very -- Zalando's a very innovative e-commerce company in Europe, and we are sharing data in very innovative ways around consumers so that we can offer the best experiences to consumers in a differentiated way in the markets across Europe. And so the conversations around the future, I think all of them see the same, blended or seamless digital and physical experience together that we're committed to creating. And I think we all believe that this is going to become an era of differentiated retail versus undifferentiated, and they see opportunity. We have to work through this challenging period together, which we will. But I think all of them see the opportunity to emerge stronger and to accelerate the transformation of the marketplace.

So Jamie, what I'd say is while, obviously, there are some elements of these current circumstances that are unprecedented, we came into this circumstance with a strategy. And you know our strategy was 2x direct. That was a strategy that was not a NIKE only strategy. It was really focused on driving more direct connections with our consumers leveraging digital, both in our own stores, online and with our partners and through their online presence. That's accelerating for everyone right now. So if you think about the North American marketplace in Europe, with most stores closed, both our own stores and most of our retail partners, what is really accelerating is that perspective and on the opportunities to connect with consumers digitally from a brand perspective, but also expand our ability to connect with consumers from a product and service perspective. When we say partnership, it's not just transactional. It's not a back-and-forth transactional type of dialogue with our partners. We're talking to our partners about both how we come through this period and then what we build for the long term. And there are a couple of things that we're building. We're all expanding our digital -- so to speak. We, in North America, have already doubled the ability, the capacity to distribute product one-to-one to consumers through our distribution centers in just several days. So it's really accelerating what we saw as the future in terms of digital penetration. From an inventory perspective, right now, digital is the -- is where the water is flowing, so to speak, or where the product is flowing. And so we're working closely in partnership with folks like Zalando in Europe, as John mentioned. We already had an inventory partnership program with Zalando where we transact via their site and ours, via their digital ecosystem and our digital ecosystem while leveraging each other's inventory. And we're working with our partners in the U.S. in a similar regard managing the inventory they have on hand, the inventory we have on hand relative to them and how best to flow that through their digital pipes as well as ours. So I think in summary, what I'd say is, as John said, it's accelerating quite a bit of change in consumer behavior. It's also accelerating quite a bit of change in our partners' behavior."

I'll take that question, Alexandra. I think what we're finding is that there are several levers from the perspective of of resetting inventory or supply, as one might say, relative to the pace of expansion in digital demand, the reopening of stores and then the amount of traffic going to those stores and the amount of conversion. And so there isn't a sort of one size fits all or not just one lever. So what we're doing with our own inventory and with our partners, is we're looking at a lot of different levers. We're looking at realigning our product offer dates. So not only do we have some inventory going into these circumstances, but we've got a great pipeline of product. And we can move some of those product offer dates out to some extent as we work through the inventory that we'll build over these weeks in which we're dealing with these circumstances in each market. We are primarily talking to our partners about managing inventory movement, the generation -- and the generation of cash flow with a view towards getting back to 14 to 16 weeks or so on hand in the market and 14 weeks or so on hand of inventory for NIKE and strong full price sell-through. Some of the levers we'll employ in that regard will impact gross margin negatively. That's somewhat obvious. That could be promotion, it could be cancellation of orders. At the same time, none of those data points will represent a trend. So what you're likely to see in the near term is a focus on supply and demand management, that will impact revenue, may have a negative -- will have a negative impact on margin, but that is part and parcel goes with resetting that foundation for strong profitable growth. It's not a new trend. It's not a reflection of the strength of our product. In fact, John mentioned some of the launches we've had in China. We've actually had some product launches here in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks that have sold through at full price. So it will be a blend of working through inventory, which does have some impact on margin and a blend of bringing innovation and fresh, compelling new product to consumers. So probably be looking for energy and inspiration and optimism."

But I've spent time now in several of our markets across the U.S., and I've seen firsthand how NIKE's key city strategy is paying off. Andy mentioned the growth in New York, growth in LA being double digit. And that is because both with Nike Direct and with our partners, we're getting closer to the consumer. And I'll just take a couple of examples. I had a chance to visit the Foot Locker very innovative store in Washington Heights neighborhood in New York, where the entire display of the inventory, and the merchandise and the whole focus is being of the neighborhood. And you can just see consumers responding. And that store is experiencing significantly greater growth than other comparable stores that Foot Locker has in the area. So it's a great example of differentiated retail and the future of retail. We're doing the same with some of the Latino communities and LA providing retail concepts, both through NIKE Direct and with our partners that are getting close to what consumers want in those markets and give a more personalized feel. And when you wrap that around with a digital connection with membership and the other digital tools, you can feel the energy and momentum.

I appreciate you recognizing that, that growth has been consistently strong in North America. And obviously, one of the things I should say is we are entering these challenging times in a position of strength. And as John said, strong brands get stronger during these times. So we think we'll emerge even stronger. For a little bit of context on the strength we had entering the fourth quarter. NIKE Digital continues to fuel strong growth in North America, up a relatively extraordinary 33% in the quarter. We've talked to you about the significant opportunity that we think in terms of the women's business. Our women's business grew at a rate that was nearly double that of men's. Both in footwear and apparel, so we're seeing strong growth there. Now across footwear and apparel, our growth was relatively balanced, both in the mid-single digits, and that's even taking into account the divestiture of Hurley, which was a large apparel business and the shift in our business model with respect to the NFL, which is also largely an apparel business. So what you can infer from that as we've told you, we think we  have an epic growth opportunity in digital, in women's and in apparel. And when you take into account those noncomparables in the quarter, all 3, including apparel, are over-indexing in terms of growth. So again, we feel great about the position of strength that we had and have, from a brand perspective as we work through these challenges. And we'll be doing everything we can in terms of managing demand and supply and fueling our brand so that we emerge even stronger."

Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China.

Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of our geographies and categories. But let's take a step back. We're living in an unprecedented moment. And like never before, each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we will respond. So let me tell you what we've seen over the past 2 months.
When COVID-19 began to aggressively spread across China in late January, our top priority was to protect the health and safety of our teammates and our consumers. We immediately began closing stores. And as of 45 days ago, we had closed more than 5,000 stores in Greater China while the remaining open doors were operating with severely reduced hours. Not surprisingly, retail volume in China plummeted, but we acted quickly and decisively, leveraging our diverse sourcing base and digital capabilities to manage the business with flexibility and shifting our inventory to serve consumer digital demand.
At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network to inspire and support consumers across China to stay active and connected while at home. As a result, our Nike Training Club workouts in China saw an extraordinary rise in sign up and engagement. In fact, our weekly active users for all of our NIKE activity apps were up 80% by the end of Q3 versus the beginning of the quarter. And here's what happened. The strong engagement of Chinese consumers with our activity apps translated into strong engagement with our NIKE commerce app. As a result, our digital business in China grew more than 30% and maintained strong momentum throughout this challenging period, a powerful statement of NIKE's agile problem-solving in times of disruption.
Then approximately 30 days ago, we began to gradually reopen stores in China. People got back to work, and retail traffic began improving significantly. Today, nearly 80% of our stores in China have reopened, with more coming back online every day. In fact, just last week, we reopened our first store in the Wuhan area. And the results are encouraging. Our digital business in China has accelerated even further over the past month, and we are now seeing double-digit increases in retail traffic week-over-week with some stores having already returned to prior year levels. Credit for this response goes to Angela Dong, who leads our Greater China geography and her talented team of more than 1,600. I spoke with Angela 2 nights ago, and she has been telling me about the positive sentiment consumers in China are feeling for NIKE, and I can't overstate how impressed I am. It's become quite clear to me that when NIKE says we are a brand of China for China, it's really true. And it's no surprise to see the business already rebounding given the depth of our connection and the incredible strength of our local leadership team.
So today, I can say that we're seeing the other side of the crisis in China. And due to the resilience and creativity of our team in China, we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere. In addition to Greater China, we've applied that playbook in Japan and South Korea over the past 2 months, and we're seeing early momentum in those markets as well. And with COVID-19 now spreading across Europe and the U.S., we are applying the same playbook. We have prioritized the health and safety of our teammates, and we have closed our stores. Over the weekend, we drove a strong digital marketing campaign to engage consumers across Europe and across the U.S. to stay healthy and connected while they're at home. And our digital commerce remains open and in growth mode, supported by our teammates in our distribution centers.
We also know that this is a moment in society where the private sector has a major role to play. Companies like NIKE need to do our part. So our teams in innovation and manufacturing are exploring designs for personal protective equipment, or PPE, to support doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of this outbreak. Based on needs identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health and Science University, our teammates are working right now about how to best help, including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others. It's been so energizing to see the quick strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need.
That said, we expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period for those living in the U.S. and Europe. And I can't precisely predict how long the containment phase of the outbreak will last. But our experience in China, Japan and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future. And I can assure you this, as the situation continues to evolve, we will be ready, and we will respond. We'll be guided by our values, and we will execute with empathy and with decisiveness.
For instance, we'll continue to maintain pay continuity even while our facilities are closed or have altered schedules. We know that our people are vital to fueling our deep connections with consumers, whether they work in our stores or our distribution centers. And what's more, it's simply the right thing to do. So while this is an uncertain and challenging time, NIKE has the foundation in place to emerge from it stronger than ever. Thanks to our competitive advantages, the power of our brand in connection with consumers, our digital capabilities, our compelling product innovation and most importantly our extraordinary team, we will manage our business back to full recovery. We know in times like these that strong brands get even stronger. And I truly believe that no one is better equipped than NIKE to navigate the current climate. 
So with that said, let's go a bit deeper. I spent the last 90 days digging into this extraordinary company. I thought I knew NIKE after 5 years on the board, but believe me, when you get to dive even deeper, this place is even more impressive than I imagined. Let me walk you through what I've learned through the lens of the 4 strengths I just mentioned: our strong brand, our digital advantage, our product innovation and our extraordinary team. These are the strengths that will continue to set us apart, and these are the strengths that will allow us to shape the future marketplace going forward. 
Since I started as CEO in January, I have visited with our teams in several of our key cities, experiencing firsthand our deep connections with local consumers around the world as well as our innovative retail concepts. I've also had the opportunity to meet with many of our most important strategic partners. During my first week as CEO in early January, I spent time in China and Japan before the virus took hold. I got to see firsthand just how deeply the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands are connecting with consumers, both in compelling retail executions and in the many ways that NIKE partners with regional, local governments to grow physical activity and sports. Our brand is driving these powerful connections to consumers worldwide. In fact, we were the #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in Q3, and we continue to gain market share in key cities, such as Berlin, Mexico City and Tokyo.
And during a time of physical store closures around the world, we know that our digital foundation will help us emerge out of this situation in an even stronger position. For instance, in Q3, digital delivered 36% currency-neutral growth, and it will continue to be a powerful driver of our deep consumer connections. As I mentioned early, we are executing our learnings from China about fueling sport and fitness all over the world. We're using our digital advantage to connect with and support our consumers as behaviors around staying healthy at home continue to evolve.
Over the weekend, we made the NTC premium free for everyone in the U.S. for 90 days. NTC premium offers the best on-demand workouts and expert tips from our master trainers and others as well as inspiration and support for healthy living. Digital remains our fastest-growing channel, with owned and partnered digital already representing more than 20% of our overall business. And our apps continue to be the sharp point of our growth. With the Nike App growing revenue close to triple digits once again in Q3, fueling member acquisition and strong monthly engagement. And while we've driven impressive results, acquiring new members, engaging them and fueling increased digital demand, we know that the opportunity here is still far greater than what we've realized to date and will become an even greater advantage for NIKE as we move forward.
And even while our stores remain closed in Europe and the U.S., we continue to work on defining the future of seamless physical and digital retail. To expand the advantage we have in digital, we continue to invest in our NIKE Direct businesses, enhancing rich experiences like those in the Nike App at Retail. And we are increasingly concentrating on our online to off-line journey and accelerating our work to fully connect the marketplace while creating frictionless experiences for consumers throughout the world.
Another clear competitive advantage is our product innovation. Our product and innovation have always set NIKE apart from others, and I firmly believe this will become even more important of a differentiator as we look ahead. Over the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with our innovation, design, product and merchandising teams. I've done several deep dives in these areas, and I am truly blown away. As a Board member, you get to see a lot, but you can never fully understand how impressive NIKE's product innovation capability is until you spend time with our teams.
For instance, today, we have more than 1,000 designers working at NIKE, with broad and deep talent across footwear and apparel. And you can just feel how their creativity and vision for product inspires everyone here and inspires consumers around the world. I got to see some of this innovative product on display at the Nike 2020 Forum last month in New York, which served as a great illustration of the power of our 2X Innovation offense. There, we announced a powerful array of breakthrough products, such as our Next% footwear line which offers measurable benefits to consumers. We also launched a new aesthetic for sustainability where we're delivering new scalable platforms like no one else. And by bringing together athletes and creative partners as only NIKE can, the forum was an optimistic statement about the future of sport culture.
And our advantage goes beyond our incredible product pipeline. It has become even more clear to me why NIKE leads the industry. Our innovation, product and design teams have an unrelenting commitment to discovering what's next. This culture of innovation is pervasive across our organization and deeply embedded within NIKE teams around the world. From those who engage consumers at retail, to those creating the next wave of digital experiences that connect with consumers daily. Fueled by data and analytics capabilities, we are equipped with deep consumer insight that we combine with our design expertise and athlete research. This process directly translates into breakthrough product season after season, allowing us to drive more separation in the marketplace.
There's one last thing I'd like to mention. As you know, the organized sports world remains on hold and yet the global culture of health and wellness continues unabated. In fact, in many ways, people are looking to health and wellness now more than ever. Whether it's to stay in shape at home or with a focus on mental health in stressful times, people all over the globe are finding ways to make sport a daily habit wherever, whenever and however they can. And as you may have seen, this past weekend, we encouraged consumers worldwide to work out at home with a simple message: Play inside, play for the world.
We're seeing new behaviors normalize in countries all over the globe, and we're shifting our entire consumer ecosystem to deliver access to sports that speaks to consumers' changing lives. Across key markets, we're working to create shared experiences and opportunity for virtual participation, connecting people to something bigger and showing how sport can inspire. And though there's no predicting when organized sports will restart when our athletes, teams and leagues can return to competition, I do have one guarantee. When the gates reopen, when the first whistle sounds, the energy is going to be off the charts. The world's passion for sports remains undiminished. And when it all returns, NIKE will be right there with sports fans everywhere.
In summary, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q3. And amidst unprecedented conditions across the globe, we are staying focused on not simply managing through this situation but taking the actions that will allow us to emerge from it even stronger than before. We know it won't be easy, but NIKE is better prepared than anyone else to regain that momentum, extend our brand leadership and reshape the future marketplace.
NIKE has a long history of rising to the occasion in extraordinary times to deliver strong results and effect extraordinary change in the world of sport and beyond. And that's what we're going to do once again.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy."

Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the business decisions we're making.
We have a maxim at NIKE, we win as a team. And I can tell you that the resilience, strength, empathy and creativity of our teammates has never been on greater display. Our team has always been NIKE's greatest advantage. On that note, I want to congratulate one of my teammates, Matt Friend, on his new role going forward. Matt and I have worked closely together since he joined NIKE 11 years ago. He's been a great thought partner to me over that time, and we're working seamlessly together through this transition. As I move into my new role with NIKE, I could not be more confident in NIKE's financial management with Matt as our CFO.
So as we close Q3 and look ahead, we see 3 key themes. First, as we enter these challenging circumstances, NIKE's brand leadership and business momentum have been stronger than ever and unrivaled around the world. In Q3, we delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth overall, led by 13% growth in both EMEA and APLA. NIKE Greater China was also on pace to deliver another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth prior to the impact of COVID-19. And in North America, our strong mid-single-digit reported rate of revenue growth would have been roughly 3 points higher if not for noncomparable items, including the sale of Hurley and our shift to a licensed business model with Fanatics relative to the NFL. While those transactions had a negative impact on our year-over-year revenue growth comparisons, they also result in higher profitability for NIKE.
Across all of our geographies and Converse, digital remained our fastest-growing channel, growing 36% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, each of our geographies and Converse exceeded 30% digital revenue growth in the quarter. Our growth was also broad-based across categories as well as across women's and men's, all fueled by innovation platforms and power franchises such as the Air Max 270, the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. Our launch of the Air Jordan 11 ""Bred"" was the largest in our history with the product selling out in 28 minutes powered by the SNKRS App. In fact, the Jordan Brand grew double digits globally in the quarter.
The LeBron 17, Giannis Zoom Freak and the City Edition NBA jerseys fueled basketball's strong growth. And in running, we unveiled our most advanced performance running shoe ever, the Alphafly Next%. We also launched the new Infinity React, designed to help runners run longer, and we've seen very strong sell-through, particularly with women.
Apparel also fueled growth in the quarter, growing faster than footwear, with double-digit apparel growth in our sportswear, training, basketball, women's and kids' categories.
Setting aside the noncash nonrecurring charges related to our business model changes in South America, NIKE, Inc.'s earnings exceeded the earnings that were implied in the financial guidance we provided 90 days ago. We were able to deliver that strong bottom line performance, even including the impact of COVID-19 on Greater China.
The second key theme as we look ahead, relates to how we're addressing the evolving implications of COVID-19. As John said, we are executing on an operational playbook focused on positioning NIKE for an expedited return to profitable, capital-efficient growth. We see each of our markets progressing through a time series that begins with the country addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by 3 phases from a business perspective: one, a recovery period, including, for example, the ramp-up of store reopenings; two, a period of normalization across consumer demand and supply; and three, a period in which we return to strong growth.
Why are we so confident in our approach? Well, as John said, our team in Greater China has given us a playbook for the rest of the world. Based upon the most recent trends we see today, NIKE Greater China has already progressed through the recovery phase and is now transitioning into the normalization phase. Specifically, we are seeing accelerating strong double-digit, approaching triple-digit growth in our NIKE Digital business. At the same time, roughly 80% of our 7,000 brick-and-mortar NIKE-owned and partner stores are now open. Based on the latest trends in our business, NIKE Greater China Q4 revenue will likely be roughly flat versus Q4 of fiscal year '19.
We're also executing on this playbook in Japan and Korea. Both markets are entering the normalization phase, fueled by strong digital growth and significant week-over-week increases in retail traffic and demand for NIKE. Based on what we're experiencing in China, Korea and Japan, we are optimistic. At the same time, this has become a global pandemic. Each country is addressing COVID-19 differently. And accordingly, our markets will progress through the 3 phases from a business perspective on different time lines. That adds some complexity from a global point of view. So we're also executing against a top-down enterprise-wide operational plan.
Our top-down plan includes: one, tight cost management; and two, daily global demand and supply optimization. Accordingly, our Q4 SG&A will be lower than prior year Q4 spending. We're also taking decisive action with respect to supply on a global basis, while shifting our distribution focus to digital in the face of temporary retail store closures. As a result, Q4 fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '21 year-over-year revenue, margin and inventory growth rates will neither be intuitive nor linear. Our measures of success in the near term will be rooted in the amount of inventory on-hand relative to the pace of digital demand, store reopenings and traffic patterns.
Now going into this, we were fortunately experiencing a very strong pull market for NIKE globally, with some of the highest rates of full-price sell-through we have ever experienced. So we're now aggressively managing all of our operating levers to ensure that we expedite NIKE's return to that strong full market. Realigning supply and demand is our focus operationally.
We're also executing this plan leveraging 2 of NIKE's long-standing and greatest competitive advantages. First, Nike's financial strength. Liquidity will not be an issue for NIKE. In order to ensure resilience during challenging times, we have long maintained a strong balance sheet, a strong investment-grade credit rating and ample access to capital, all coupled with strong operating cash flow generation. NIKE's liquidity and access to capital affords us the ability to be principled, for example, with respect to pay continuity, and decisive relative to real-time supply and demand management. 
Second, we have forged the strongest partnerships across the value chain in this industry. That includes, among others, our marketplace partners like Topsports, Pou Sheng and Tmall in China as well as Foot Locker, DICK'S, JD and Zalando across the U.S. and Europe. Of course, we also have long-standing partnerships that span decades with manufacturers such as Feng Tay, Shenzhou, Chang Shin and many others. We're working closely with all of these strategic partners on a daily basis. Our partners recognize that the stronger NIKE is going forward, the stronger they are. Of course, NIKE is not operating in isolation. External factors will continue to be dynamic, and we will continue to adjust our execution accordingly. 
The third key theme as we look forward. While the setbacks from a business perspective will be significant for all, NIKE will come back even stronger as a brand and as a company. Consumer behavior is changing real time. We're all witnessing new normals emerge in terms of both how consumers shop and stay active. Sport is being redefined as much broader than competition as the world finds new and creative ways to stay healthy and fit. And NIKE's digital ecosystem is keeping us connected real time. From a marketplace perspective, NIKE Digital growth is accelerating amidst these dynamics.
From a digital capability perspective, the investments we've made to date are now proving to be the foundation for our resilience amidst challenge, and they will be strength as we emerge. For example, we're leveraging select team and tools to dynamically model demand, pricing, planning and allocation; we're leveraging our NIKE membership platform and NIKE mobile app ecosystem to inspire and enable people to be active at home, while also providing targeted product offers and services to consumers. And the foundation we've built in enterprise data and analytics is fueling our more agile end-to-end execution.
As we've said, we're still in the early innings of NIKE's digital transformation. But the capabilities we've already been building for the future are proving to be the strongest pillars within our business today. As John said, simply put, these are times in which strong brands get stronger, and we're confident that NIKE will come back stronger than ever.
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 5%, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong balanced growth across EMEA, APLA, North America and Greater China prior to the impact of COVID-19, all fueled by Nike digital growing 36% versus prior year. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points in Q3 as higher average selling prices and better off-price margin were offset by the impact of COVID-19 primarily in Greater China as we managed inventory sell-through in that market. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX headwinds and incremental tariffs in North America.
SG&A grew 6% in Q3. We continue to invest in our digital transformation, while also beginning to more tightly manage operating overhead and shift demand creation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 3.9% compared to 14.7% for the same period last year due to a shift in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and increased benefits from discrete items.
Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.53, including the $0.25 noncash nonrecurring FX-related charge associated with the transition of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic distributor models.
As of February 29, inventories were up 7% compared to the prior period reflecting healthy full-price versus off-price mix prior to the impacts of COVID-19. 
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, which again would have been approximately 3 points higher adjusting for the sale of Hurley and our partnership with Fanatics regarding the NFL business. In Q3, NIKE Digital grew over 30% and the Nike App grew over 60% in North America. New York City and L.A. each grew double digits, fueled by differentiated NIKE consumer experiences. As an example, in L.A., we launched our newest Nike Live concept store in Glendale, which blew passed our expectations, and significantly over-indexed in terms of the women's business.
Now as of today, we've closed our own stores in North America. Going forward, we will reopen stores on a location-by-location basis as we closely monitor developments. At the same time, NIKE Digital demand has been extraordinary, with NIKE Digital commerce sales over just the past few days approaching holiday peak levels, growing triple digits over just the past week. We've maintained operations in our distribution centers, implementing social distancing and reduced staffing, while focusing on the shipment of digital orders.
Now let's turn to EMEA, where we continue to build on our extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit growth in most key categories. Women's growth strongly outpaced men's, apparel accelerated faster than footwear, and digital was up over 40%. The NIKE Brand has never been stronger in EMEA. In every key city in EMEA, consumers rated NIKE their #1 favorite and cool brand.
We also gained significant market share in Q3 across both footwear and apparel, driving further brand separation. Greater speed and agility also fueled our growth and share gains in EMEA in Q3, with over 30% of EMEA revenue and nearly 80% of EMEA incremental growth flowing through our Express Lane. In order to help limit the spread of COVID-19, we have also closed our own stores in Western Europe and select Eastern European markets. And similar to the U.S., we will reopen on a location-by-location basis based on developments.
NIKE Digital continues to grow versus prior year, and we're maintaining operations in our distribution centers, again, shifting their focus towards digital distribution.
In our APLA geography, revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by our key cities and was balanced across key categories, nearly all of which were up double digits. The Jordan Brand, in particular, was incredibly strong in APLA, growing nearly 50% in the quarter, with new innovation like the Jordan Max 200, along with fresh new approaches to Jordan icons all resonating with consumers.
In performance running, our accelerating momentum continued especially in Japan, where we dominated the Hakone Ekiden competitive race, seeing a record 84% of participants wearing NIKE. The energy around running in Japan is being fueled by the Vaporfly Next% as well as a halo effect that is impacting other performance models like the Zoom Fly, Rival Fly and Peg Turbo, which all grew triple digits in Q3.
NIKE Digital grew 51%, and wholesale grew double digits overall on a currency-neutral basis as business with our differentiated strategic partners grew 5x as fast as undifferentiated distribution. As we've said, APLA is our most diverse geography, so we are seeing the impact of COVID-19 vary significantly across Asian and Latin American countries. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China. While our full quarter results in Greater China were significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is worth providing some dimension. Our momentum in China continued to be extraordinary through mid-January. Our revenue growth was on track to exceed the expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by NIKE Digital. We launched the Nike App in China in Q3, and today, we already have 5 million Nike App downloads. And as John said, we're also seeing a spike in weekly average users on our activity apps as we inspire and enable consumers to engage in sport at home. 
We're now, as I said, through the recovery phase and into the normalization period in China. Today, our digital commerce growth continues to accelerate, with triple-digit growth in demand just this last week. Most of our stores and our partner stores are open; retail traffic is significantly accelerating week-over-week; and we're beginning to see a decline from the peak inventory levels we experienced. We are confident that NIKE Greater China is on track to return to growth in fiscal year '21.
As we look ahead, we will not be providing financial guidance for Q4 due to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19. For fiscal year '21, we have been planning performance in line with our long-term financial model. The year-over-year growth rate base comparisons will no longer be meaningful. So we'll share the approach that we're taking with respect to fiscal year '21 on our next earnings call.
All of that said, we are confident that executing our operational plan will position NIKE for a return to profitable capital-efficient growth. That will happen over time as each country addresses COVID-19 at a different pace. But our confidence in the return to growth is founded on the relatively rapid recovery and early signs of normalization we are already seeing in China, Korea and Japan.
In these challenging times, NIKE's competitive advantages are showing up as extraordinary resilience. As we emerge from these challenges, those same competitive advantages will show up as strength and brand distinction. Those unique strengths include NIKE's deep, authentic connection to consumers, our pipeline of innovative products, our financial strength and capacity, our industry-leading digital capabilities, our strong partnerships and most importantly our talented and committed teams around the world. I would not trade NIKE's team or position with anybody.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And they're doing, I think, what's appropriate by prioritizing the health and safety of their athletes and fans, and we're very supportive of that. And we look forward to when organized sport will be back and running. And when they are, we'll be there. 
But I think it's important to separate those sporting events and our innovation pipeline because we will continue to move forward in our innovation pipeline. And as I said earlier, we're very excited about the products in that pipeline and the products we're introducing, in fact, more excited than perhaps any time before. And while we announced some of these products around the Olympics, if the Olympics gets deferred for a year, we can still launch them on our timing. So 2 specific examples. As you know, the Next% performance running line will allow runners of all abilities to have the same technology and measurable benefits of the Alphafly Next% that the world's leading marathoners have. And we can launch that when the time is right, unrelated to the Olympics. Similarly, some of the sustainability products we announced at the forum, the VaporMax 2020, which utilizes 75% recycled manufacturing waste, or the Space Hippie line, which is an innovative way to have low-carbon footprint footwear, we can launch when the time is right, when we get to the recovery and normalization periods. And so consumer demand for those things is strong and will continue to be strong. And so we simply are going to move ahead with our product pipeline at the right moments in the right ways.
I'll just make one small final example before turning it over to Andy. In China, we got creative, and we took a couple of launches that were scheduled in February and made them digital-only launches. So the Air Jordan Retro High OG and the Air Jordan 5 Retro, we made digital-only launches in a world where stores are closed and -- but digital demand is strong. So we're going to proceed full speed ahead with that product pipeline. 
Andy, do you want to talk about the second part of the question?"

I'd just say, just to summarize some of what both John and I said in the remarks and John just reiterated, we came into these circumstances in an incredibly strong position. Some of the highest full-price sell-through we've seen. Inventory is really healthy. As we go forward, we recognize that there will be some promotion in the marketplace. But as John said, we've also got an amazing pipeline of innovative and compelling fresh products. And what we'll be doing is working on the timing of the launch of those products and the flow of those products over time, so that while we're working through energy, we're -- and working through inventory, we're also bringing distinctive energy to the market and to consumers. 
You asked about our licensed business. Just for context, our licensed business is a very low single-digit percentage of our overall business. We'll have some impact on that business. I'd say, just keep in mind that a lot of these elite sporting activities or events are being postponed versus necessarily canceled. Although some of them have been canceled. But one of the things we recognize around here is our product -- some of our product has a little bit longer life cycle. And come fall, we think we could be kicking off one of the greatest years in sports history.
Now you also asked about SG&A. So from an SG&A perspective, the short answer is we've got quite a bit of flexibility within our SG&A. And that's one of the reasons you saw us deliver profitability even in Q3, when we were all a bit taken off guard by the significant impact of COVID-19, we were still able to deliver profitability that exceeded the guidance we set 90 days ago. As I also mentioned, based on some quick and agile work across our cross-functional teams, we see SG&A in Q4 declining versus prior year. There's quite a bit of flexibility in demand creation. And actually, it ties back to your question about sport. As John mentioned in his remarks, we've done some really creative things from a digital connectivity perspective with huge impact. So quick, low-cost, extraordinary impact. And we think within demand creation, we can save quite a bit of our powder for the return to sport that we see within fiscal year '21.
Within SG&A, our liquidity and our access to capital allows us within SG&A to stay very principled. So continued pay continuity, as John talked about. And at the same time, continuing to invest in those things that even now more than ever, we see as differentiators long term, albeit, we'll do it in a more focused way. So beyond that, there are quite a bit of opportunities with operating overhead and CapEx. And when I said our team has just been amazing in terms of their resilience and creativity, it actually includes in terms of tightly managing our cost."

So one of the real advantages, as you said, of NIKE being a scaled global company is we can extract learning and insight from each of our markets. And so here's what we've seen, just to quickly recap what Andy and I talked about. We're looking at things through the lens of 4 phases to this: containment of the outbreak, first; second, recovery period when stores reopen; third, normalization when things get back to growth from the prior year; and then fourth, return to growth. And the data from actually China, Japan and Korea was fairly consistent. Containment took 5 to 6 weeks. Stores were closed but the e-commerce growth in all 3 markets remained strong during that time, augmented by NIKE connecting with consumers around being active while at home. Now all 3 markets are through what we're calling recovery, that is retail is opening back up. Consumers are back on the streets. And we're seeing, as we move into normalization, retail traffic is coming back. Consumers are in the stores. They're engaged. They're often wearing face masks, but they're back on the street. 
Interestingly, digital has accelerated even more since the stores have been open. Again, I think pointing to this blended digital versus physical experience is a thing of the past. Consumers don't think in those terms. So I bring a sort of consumer technology lens, where we learned that consumers want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. And they don't think about, oh, I'm going to make a digital purchase or a physical purchase. A consumer may often start shopping on their mobile device, they may go into a store and have it shipped at home, they may order online and pick it up in a store. And what we're seeing in Japan, China and Korea is that seamless digital-physical experience is responding to what consumers want.
And I might note as our business comes back in those 3 markets, we're outperforming our competition, consistent with a mantra of ensuring that we come through this period in an even stronger position and extend our leadership position. So in the U.S., obviously, we're in much -- we're earlier in the cycle. We've closed the stores. We're taking care of our employees. We digitally connected with consumers over the weekend around health and their activity. So our brand is present day in and day out with them. As Andy mentioned, we're seeing very strong digital growth, even in these dark days. And we're managing our inventory so that we can be ready when recovery comes. We can't -- none of us can't predict perfectly how long the containment phase is going to take in the U.S. and Europe. But what we can know is when stores start reopening -- or while stores are closed, we're going to be there digitally. We're going to be there digitally with activity apps and commerce. And when the stores start reopening, we're going to be leveraging our strengths, our unique strengths, with strong compelling product, a digital connection with consumers that is unmatched, these seamless digital and physical experiences at both NIKE Direct and our partners. We're working very closely with our partners. And in fact, in the last 3 days, I've talked to the CEOs of Zalando, JD, Foot Locker, in the last couple of months, met with DICK's CEO, the CEOs of our 2 Chinese partners, we're working together to be ready when things recover and then our brand. 
So I think it's going to accelerate what was already going to happen with digital transformation. Consumers will continue, digital is a more prominent role in their lives. You'll see more digital growth. And I think the shape of the future marketplace where differentiated retail thrives, undifferentiated retail struggles. That will simply be accelerated. So we intend to drive both."

And so -- and we engage with them both around their physical stores and around online. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with the CEO of Zalando, who is obviously a very -- Zalando's a very innovative e-commerce company in Europe, and we are sharing data in very innovative ways around consumers so that we can offer the best experiences to consumers in a differentiated way in the markets across Europe. And so the conversations around the future, I think all of them see the same blended or seamless digital and physical experience together that we're committed to creating. And I think we all believe that this is going to become an era of differentiated retail versus undifferentiated, and they see opportunity. We have to work through this challenging period together, which we will. But I think all of them see the opportunity to emerge stronger and to accelerate the transformation of the marketplace.

So Jamie, what I'd say is while, obviously, there are some elements of these current circumstances that are unprecedented, we came into this circumstance with a strategy. And you know our strategy was 2X Direct. That was a strategy that was not a NIKE-only strategy. It was really focused on driving more direct connections with our consumers leveraging digital, both in our own stores, online and with our partners and through their online presence. That's accelerating for everyone right now. So if you think about the North America marketplace and Europe, with most stores closed, both our own stores and most of our retail partners, what is really accelerating is that perspective and -- on the opportunities to connect with consumers digitally from a brand perspective, but also expand our ability to connect with consumers from a product and service perspective. 
When we say partnership, it's not just transactional. It's not a back-and-forth transactional type of dialogue with our partners. We're talking to our partners about both how we come through this period and then what we build for the long term. And there are a couple of things that we're building. We're all expanding our digital pipe, so to speak. We, in North America, have already doubled the ability, the capacity to distribute product one-to-one to consumers through our distribution centers in just several days. So it's really accelerating what we saw as the future in terms of digital penetration. 
From an inventory perspective, right now, digital is the -- is where the water is flowing, so to speak, or where the product is flowing. And so we're working closely in partnership with folks like Zalando in Europe, as John mentioned. We already had an inventory partnership program with Zalando where we transact via their site and ours, via their digital ecosystem and our digital ecosystem while leveraging each other's inventory. And we're working with our partners in the U.S. in a similar regard, managing the inventory they have on hand, the inventory we have on hand relative to them and how best to flow that through their digital pipes as well as ours. 
So I think in summary, what I'd say is, as John said, it's accelerating quite a bit of change in consumer behavior. It's also accelerating quite a bit of change in our partners' behavior."

I'll take that question, Alexandra. I think what we're finding is that there are several levers from the perspective of resetting inventory or supply, as one might say, relative to the pace of expansion in digital demand, the reopening of stores and then the amount of traffic going to those stores and the amount of conversion. And so there isn't a sort of one size fits all or not just one lever. So what we're doing with our own inventory and with our partners is we're looking at a lot of different levers. We're looking at realigning our product offer dates. So not only do we have some inventory going into these circumstances, but we've got a great pipeline of products. And we can move some of those product offer dates out to some extent as we work through the inventory that we'll build over these weeks in which we're dealing with these circumstances in each market. 
We are primarily talking to our partners about managing inventory movement, the generation -- and the generation of cash flow with a view towards getting back to 14 to 16 weeks or so on hand in the market and 14 weeks or so on hand of inventory for NIKE and strong full-price sell-through. Some of the levers we'll employ in that regard will impact gross margin negatively. That's somewhat obvious. That could be promotion. It could be cancellation of orders. At the same time, none of those data points will represent a trend. 
So what you're likely to see in the near term is a focus on supply and demand management. That will impact revenue, may have a negative -- will have a negative impact on margin, but that is part and parcel goes with resetting that foundation for strong profitable growth. It's not a new trend. It's not a reflection of the strength of our product. In fact, John mentioned some of the launches we've had in China. We've actually had some product launches here in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks that have sold through at full price. So it will be a blend of working through inventory, which does have some impact on margin, and a blend of bringing innovation and fresh, compelling new product to consumers, who are probably will be looking for energy and inspiration and optimism."

Andy mentioned the growth in New York, growth in L.A. being double digit. And that is because both with NIKE Direct and with our partners, we're getting closer to the consumer. And I'll just take a couple of examples. I had a chance to visit the Foot Locker very innovative store in Washington Heights neighborhood in New York, where the entire display of the inventory and the merchandise and the whole focus is being of the neighborhood. And you can just see consumers responding. And that store is experiencing significantly greater growth than other comparable stores that Foot Locker has in the area. So it's a great example of differentiated retail and the future of retail. 
We're doing the same with some of the Latino communities in L.A., providing retail concepts, both through NIKE Direct and with our partners that are getting close to what consumers want in those markets and give a more personalized feel. And when you wrap that around with a digital connection, with membership and the other digital tools, you can feel the energy and momentum.

And obviously, one of the things I should say is we are entering these challenging times in a position of strength. And as John said, strong brands get stronger during these times. So we think we'll emerge even stronger. 
For a little bit of context on the strength we had entering this fourth quarter, NIKE Digital continues to fuel strong growth in North America, up a relatively extraordinary 33% in the quarter. We've talked to you about the significant opportunity that we think in terms of the women's business. Our women's business grew at a rate that was nearly double that of men's, both in footwear and apparel, so we're seeing strong growth there. Now across footwear and apparel, our growth was relatively balanced, both in the mid-single digits, and that's even taking into account the divestiture of Hurley, which was a largely apparel business and the shift in our business model with respect to the NFL, which is also largely an apparel business. So what you can infer from that, as we've told you, we think we have an epic growth opportunity in digital, in women's and in apparel. And when you take into account those noncomparables in the quarter, all 3, including apparel, are over-indexing in terms of growth. 
So again, we feel great about the position, of strength we had and have from a brand perspective as we work through these challenges. And we'll be doing everything we can in terms of managing demand and supply and fueling our brand so that we emerge even stronger."

Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of our geographies and categories. But let's take a step back. We're living in an unprecedented moment. And like never before, each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we will respond. So let me tell you what we've seen over the past 2 months.
When COVID-19 began to aggressively spread across China in late January, our top priority was to protect the health and safety of our teammates and our consumers. We immediately began closing stores. And as of 45 days ago, we had closed more than 5,000 stores in Greater China while the remaining open doors were operating with severely reduced hours. Not surprisingly, retail volume in China plummeted, but we acted quickly and decisively, leveraging our diverse sourcing base and digital capabilities to manage the business with flexibility and shifting our inventory to serve consumer digital demand.
At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network to inspire and support consumers across China to stay active and connected while at home. As a result, our Nike Training Club workouts in China saw an extraordinary rise in sign up and engagement. In fact, our weekly active users for all of our NIKE activity apps were up 80% by the end of Q3 versus the beginning of the quarter. And here's what happened. The strong engagement of Chinese consumers with our activity apps translated into strong engagement with our NIKE commerce app. As a result, our digital business in China grew more than 30% and maintained strong momentum throughout this challenging period, a powerful statement of NIKE's agile problem-solving in times of disruption.
Then approximately 30 days ago, we began to gradually reopen stores in China. People got back to work, and retail traffic began improving significantly. Today, nearly 80% of our stores in China have reopened, with more coming back online every day. In fact, just last week, we reopened our first store in the Wuhan area. And the results are encouraging. Our digital business in China has accelerated even further over the past month, and we are now seeing double-digit increases in retail traffic week-over-week with some stores having already returned to prior year levels. Credit for this response goes to Angela Dong, who leads our Greater China geography and her talented team of more than 1,600. I spoke with Angela 2 nights ago, and she has been telling me about the positive sentiment consumers in China are feeling for NIKE, and I can't overstate how impressed I am. It's become quite clear to me that when NIKE says we are a brand of China for China, it's really true. And it's no surprise to see the business already rebounding given the depth of our connection and the incredible strength of our local leadership team.
So today, I can say that we're seeing the other side of the crisis in China. And due to the resilience and creativity of our team in China, we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere. In addition to Greater China, we've applied that playbook in Japan and South Korea over the past 2 months, and we're seeing early momentum in those markets as well. And with COVID-19 now spreading across Europe and the U.S., we are applying the same playbook. We have prioritized the health and safety of our teammates, and we have closed our stores. Over the weekend, we drove a strong digital marketing campaign to engage consumers across Europe and across the U.S. to stay healthy and connected while they're at home. And our digital commerce remains open and in growth mode, supported by our teammates in our distribution centers.
We also know that this is a moment in society where the private sector has a major role to play. Companies like NIKE need to do our part. So our teams in innovation and manufacturing are exploring designs for personal protective equipment, or PPE, to support doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of this outbreak. Based on needs identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health and Science University, our teammates are working right now about how to best help, including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others. It's been so energizing to see the quick strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need.
That said, we expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period for those living in the U.S. and Europe. And I can't precisely predict how long the containment phase of the outbreak will last. But our experience in China, Japan and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future. And I can assure you this, as the situation continues to evolve, we will be ready, and we will respond. We'll be guided by our values, and we will execute with empathy and with decisiveness.
For instance, we'll continue to maintain pay continuity even while our facilities are closed or have altered schedules. We know that our people are vital to fueling our deep connections with consumers, whether they work in our stores or our distribution centers. And what's more, it's simply the right thing to do. So while this is an uncertain and challenging time, NIKE has the foundation in place to emerge from it stronger than ever. Thanks to our competitive advantages, the power of our brand in connection with consumers, our digital capabilities, our compelling product innovation and most importantly our extraordinary team, we will manage our business back to full recovery. We know in times like these that strong brands get even stronger. And I truly believe that no one is better equipped than NIKE to navigate the current climate. 
So with that said, let's go a bit deeper. I spent the last 90 days digging into this extraordinary company. I thought I knew NIKE after 5 years on the board, but believe me, when you get to dive even deeper, this place is even more impressive than I imagined. Let me walk you through what I've learned through the lens of the 4 strengths I just mentioned: our strong brand, our digital advantage, our product innovation and our extraordinary team. These are the strengths that will continue to set us apart, and these are the strengths that will allow us to shape the future marketplace going forward. 
Since I started as CEO in January, I have visited with our teams in several of our key cities, experiencing firsthand our deep connections with local consumers around the world as well as our innovative retail concepts. I've also had the opportunity to meet with many of our most important strategic partners. During my first week as CEO in early January, I spent time in China and Japan before the virus took hold. I got to see firsthand just how deeply the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands are connecting with consumers, both in compelling retail executions and in the many ways that NIKE partners with regional, local governments to grow physical activity and sports. Our brand is driving these powerful connections to consumers worldwide. In fact, we were the #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in Q3, and we continue to gain market share in key cities, such as Berlin, Mexico City and Tokyo.
And during a time of physical store closures around the world, we know that our digital foundation will help us emerge out of this situation in an even stronger position. For instance, in Q3, digital delivered 36% currency-neutral growth, and it will continue to be a powerful driver of our deep consumer connections. As I mentioned early, we are executing our learnings from China about fueling sport and fitness all over the world. We're using our digital advantage to connect with and support our consumers as behaviors around staying healthy at home continue to evolve.
Over the weekend, we made the NTC premium free for everyone in the U.S. for 90 days. NTC premium offers the best on-demand workouts and expert tips from our master trainers and others as well as inspiration and support for healthy living. Digital remains our fastest-growing channel, with owned and partnered digital already representing more than 20% of our overall business. And our apps continue to be the sharp point of our growth. With the Nike App growing revenue close to triple digits once again in Q3, fueling member acquisition and strong monthly engagement. And while we've driven impressive results, acquiring new members, engaging them and fueling increased digital demand, we know that the opportunity here is still far greater than what we've realized to date and will become an even greater advantage for NIKE as we move forward.
And even while our stores remain closed in Europe and the U.S., we continue to work on defining the future of seamless physical and digital retail. To expand the advantage we have in digital, we continue to invest in our NIKE Direct businesses, enhancing rich experiences like those in the Nike App at Retail. And we are increasingly concentrating on our online to off-line journey and accelerating our work to fully connect the marketplace while creating frictionless experiences for consumers throughout the world.
Another clear competitive advantage is our product innovation. Our product and innovation have always set NIKE apart from others, and I firmly believe this will become even more important of a differentiator as we look ahead. Over the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with our innovation, design, product and merchandising teams. I've done several deep dives in these areas, and I am truly blown away. As a Board member, you get to see a lot, but you can never fully understand how impressive NIKE's product innovation capability is until you spend time with our teams.
For instance, today, we have more than 1,000 designers working at NIKE, with broad and deep talent across footwear and apparel. And you can just feel how their creativity and vision for product inspires everyone here and inspires consumers around the world. I got to see some of this innovative product on display at the Nike 2020 Forum last month in New York, which served as a great illustration of the power of our 2X Innovation offense. There, we announced a powerful array of breakthrough products, such as our Next% footwear line which offers measurable benefits to consumers. We also launched a new aesthetic for sustainability where we're delivering new scalable platforms like no one else. And by bringing together athletes and creative partners as only NIKE can, the forum was an optimistic statement about the future of sport culture.
And our advantage goes beyond our incredible product pipeline. It has become even more clear to me why NIKE leads the industry. Our innovation, product and design teams have an unrelenting commitment to discovering what's next. This culture of innovation is pervasive across our organization and deeply embedded within NIKE teams around the world. From those who engage consumers at retail, to those creating the next wave of digital experiences that connect with consumers daily. Fueled by data and analytics capabilities, we are equipped with deep consumer insight that we combine with our design expertise and athlete research. This process directly translates into breakthrough product season after season, allowing us to drive more separation in the marketplace.
There's one last thing I'd like to mention. As you know, the organized sports world remains on hold and yet the global culture of health and wellness continues unabated. In fact, in many ways, people are looking to health and wellness now more than ever. Whether it's to stay in shape at home or with a focus on mental health in stressful times, people all over the globe are finding ways to make sport a daily habit wherever, whenever and however they can. And as you may have seen, this past weekend, we encouraged consumers worldwide to work out at home with a simple message: Play inside, play for the world.
We're seeing new behaviors normalize in countries all over the globe, and we're shifting our entire consumer ecosystem to deliver access to sports that speaks to consumers' changing lives. Across key markets, we're working to create shared experiences and opportunity for virtual participation, connecting people to something bigger and showing how sport can inspire. And though there's no predicting when organized sports will restart when our athletes, teams and leagues can return to competition, I do have one guarantee. When the gates reopen, when the first whistle sounds, the energy is going to be off the charts. The world's passion for sports remains undiminished. And when it all returns, NIKE will be right there with sports fans everywhere.
In summary, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q3. And amidst unprecedented conditions across the globe, we are staying focused on not simply managing through this situation but taking the actions that will allow us to emerge from it even stronger than before. We know it won't be easy, but NIKE is better prepared than anyone else to regain that momentum, extend our brand leadership and reshape the future marketplace.
NIKE has a long history of rising to the occasion in extraordinary times to deliver strong results and effect extraordinary change in the world of sport and beyond. And that's what we're going to do once again.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy."

Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the busin",2673,"Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the business decisions we're making.
We have a maxim at NIKE, we win as a team. And I can tell you that the resilience, strength, empathy and creativity of our teammates has never been on greater display. Our team has always been NIKE's greatest advantage. On that note, I want to congratulate one of my teammates, Matt Friend, on his new role going forward. Matt and I have worked closely together since he joined NIKE 11 years ago. He's been a great thought partner to me over that time, and we're working seamlessly together through this transition. As I move into my new role with NIKE, I could not be more confident in NIKE's financial management with Matt as our CFO.
So as we close Q3 and look ahead, we see 3 key themes. First, as we enter these challenging circumstances, NIKE's brand leadership and business momentum have been stronger than ever and unrivaled around the world. In Q3, we delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth overall, led by 13% growth in both EMEA and APLA. NIKE Greater China was also on pace to deliver another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth prior to the impact of COVID-19. And in North America, our strong mid-single-digit reported rate of revenue growth would have been roughly 3 points higher if not for noncomparable items, including the sale of Hurley and our shift to a licensed business model with Fanatics relative to the NFL. While those transactions had a negative impact on our year-over-year revenue growth comparisons, they also result in higher profitability for NIKE.
Across all of our geographies and Converse, digital remained our fastest-growing channel, growing 36% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, each of our geographies and Converse exceeded 30% digital revenue growth in the quarter. Our growth was also broad-based across categories as well as across women's and men's, all fueled by innovation platforms and power franchises such as the Air Max 270, the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. Our launch of the Air Jordan 11 ""Bred"" was the largest in our history with the product selling out in 28 minutes powered by the SNKRS App. In fact, the Jordan Brand grew double digits globally in the quarter.
The LeBron 17, Giannis Zoom Freak and the City Edition NBA jerseys fueled basketball's strong growth. And in running, we unveiled our most advanced performance running shoe ever, the Alphafly Next%. We also launched the new Infinity React, designed to help runners run longer, and we've seen very strong sell-through, particularly with women.
Apparel also fueled growth in the quarter, growing faster than footwear, with double-digit apparel growth in our sportswear, training, basketball, women's and kids' categories.
Setting aside the noncash nonrecurring charges related to our business model changes in South America, NIKE, Inc.'s earnings exceeded the earnings that were implied in the financial guidance we provided 90 days ago. We were able to deliver that strong bottom line performance, even including the impact of COVID-19 on Greater China.
The second key theme as we look ahead, relates to how we're addressing the evolving implications of COVID-19. As John said, we are executing on an operational playbook focused on positioning NIKE for an expedited return to profitable, capital-efficient growth. We see each of our markets progressing through a time series that begins with the country addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by 3 phases from a business perspective: one, a recovery period, including, for example, the ramp-up of store reopenings; two, a period of normalization across consumer demand and supply; and three, a period in which we return to strong growth.
Why are we so confident in our approach? Well, as John said, our team in Greater China has given us a playbook for the rest of the world. Based upon the most recent trends we see today, NIKE Greater China has already progressed through the recovery phase and is now transitioning into the normalization phase. Specifically, we are seeing accelerating strong double-digit, approaching triple-digit growth in our NIKE Digital business. At the same time, roughly 80% of our 7,000 brick-and-mortar NIKE-owned and partner stores are now open. Based on the latest trends in our business, NIKE Greater China Q4 revenue will likely be roughly flat versus Q4 of fiscal year '19.
We're also executing on this playbook in Japan and Korea. Both markets are entering the normalization phase, fueled by strong digital growth and significant week-over-week increases in retail traffic and demand for NIKE. Based on what we're experiencing in China, Korea and Japan, we are optimistic. At the same time, this has become a global pandemic. Each country is addressing COVID-19 differently. And accordingly, our markets will progress through the 3 phases from a business perspective on different time lines. That adds some complexity from a global point of view. So we're also executing against a top-down enterprise-wide operational plan.
Our top-down plan includes: one, tight cost management; and two, daily global demand and supply optimization. Accordingly, our Q4 SG&A will be lower than prior year Q4 spending. We're also taking decisive action with respect to supply on a global basis, while shifting our distribution focus to digital in the face of temporary retail store closures. As a result, Q4 fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '21 year-over-year revenue, margin and inventory growth rates will neither be intuitive nor linear. Our measures of success in the near term will be rooted in the amount of inventory on-hand relative to the pace of digital demand, store reopenings and traffic patterns.
Now going into this, we were fortunately experiencing a very strong pull market for NIKE globally, with some of the highest rates of full-price sell-through we have ever experienced. So we're now aggressively managing all of our operating levers to ensure that we expedite NIKE's return to that strong full market. Realigning supply and demand is our focus operationally.
We're also executing this plan leveraging 2 of NIKE's long-standing and greatest competitive advantages. First, Nike's financial strength. Liquidity will not be an issue for NIKE. In order to ensure resilience during challenging times, we have long maintained a strong balance sheet, a strong investment-grade credit rating and ample access to capital, all coupled with strong operating cash flow generation. NIKE's liquidity and access to capital affords us the ability to be principled, for example, with respect to pay continuity, and decisive relative to real-time supply and demand management. 
Second, we have forged the strongest partnerships across the value chain in this industry. That includes, among others, our marketplace partners like Topsports, Pou Sheng and Tmall in China as well as Foot Locker, DICK'S, JD and Zalando across the U.S. and Europe. Of course, we also have long-standing partnerships that span decades with manufacturers such as Feng Tay, Shenzhou, Chang Shin and many others. We're working closely with all of these strategic partners on a daily basis. Our partners recognize that the stronger NIKE is going forward, the stronger they are. Of course, NIKE is not operating in isolation. External factors will continue to be dynamic, and we will continue to adjust our execution accordingly. 
The third key theme as we look forward. While the setbacks from a business perspective will be significant for all, NIKE will come back even stronger as a brand and as a company. Consumer behavior is changing real time. We're all witnessing new normals emerge in terms of both how consumers shop and stay active. Sport is being redefined as much broader than competition as the world finds new and creative ways to stay healthy and fit. And NIKE's digital ecosystem is keeping us connected real time. From a marketplace perspective, NIKE Digital growth is accelerating amidst these dynamics.
From a digital capability perspective, the investments we've made to date are now proving to be the foundation for our resilience amidst challenge, and they will be strength as we emerge. For example, we're leveraging select team and tools to dynamically model demand, pricing, planning and allocation; we're leveraging our NIKE membership platform and NIKE mobile app ecosystem to inspire and enable people to be active at home, while also providing targeted product offers and services to consumers. And the foundation we've built in enterprise data and analytics is fueling our more agile end-to-end execution.
As we've said, we're still in the early innings of NIKE's digital transformation. But the capabilities we've already been building for the future are proving to be the strongest pillars within our business today. As John said, simply put, these are times in which strong brands get stronger, and we're confident that NIKE will come back stronger than ever.
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 5%, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong balanced growth across EMEA, APLA, North America and Greater China prior to the impact of COVID-19, all fueled by Nike digital growing 36% versus prior year. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points in Q3 as higher average selling prices and better off-price margin were offset by the impact of COVID-19 primarily in Greater China as we managed inventory sell-through in that market. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX headwinds and incremental tariffs in North America.
SG&A grew 6% in Q3. We continue to invest in our digital transformation, while also beginning to more tightly manage operating overhead and shift demand creation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 3.9% compared to 14.7% for the same period last year due to a shift in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and increased benefits from discrete items.
Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.53, including the $0.25 noncash nonrecurring FX-related charge associated with the transition of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic distributor models.
As of February 29, inventories were up 7% compared to the prior period reflecting healthy full-price versus off-price mix prior to the impacts of COVID-19. 
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, which again would have been approximately 3 points higher adjusting for the sale of Hurley and our partnership with Fanatics regarding the NFL business. In Q3, NIKE Digital grew over 30% and the Nike App grew over 60% in North America. New York City and L.A. each grew double digits, fueled by differentiated NIKE consumer experiences. As an example, in L.A., we launched our newest Nike Live concept store in Glendale, which blew passed our expectations, and significantly over-indexed in terms of the women's business.
Now as of today, we've closed our own stores in North America. Going forward, we will reopen stores on a location-by-location basis as we closely monitor developments. At the same time, NIKE Digital demand has been extraordinary, with NIKE Digital commerce sales over just the past few days approaching holiday peak levels, growing triple digits over just the past week. We've maintained operations in our distribution centers, implementing social distancing and reduced staffing, while focusing on the shipment of digital orders.
Now let's turn to EMEA, where we continue to build on our extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit growth in most key categories. Women's growth strongly outpaced men's, apparel accelerated faster than footwear, and digital was up over 40%. The NIKE Brand has never been stronger in EMEA. In every key city in EMEA, consumers rated NIKE their #1 favorite and cool brand.
We also gained significant market share in Q3 across both footwear and apparel, driving further brand separation. Greater speed and agility also fueled our growth and share gains in EMEA in Q3, with over 30% of EMEA revenue and nearly 80% of EMEA incremental growth flowing through our Express Lane. In order to help limit the spread of COVID-19, we have also closed our own stores in Western Europe and select Eastern European markets. And similar to the U.S., we will reopen on a location-by-location basis based on developments.
NIKE Digital continues to grow versus prior year, and we're maintaining operations in our distribution centers, again, shifting their focus towards digital distribution.
In our APLA geography, revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by our key cities and was balanced across key categories, nearly all of which were up double digits. The Jordan Brand, in particular, was incredibly strong in APLA, growing nearly 50% in the quarter, with new innovation like the Jordan Max 200, along with fresh new approaches to Jordan icons all resonating with consumers.
In performance running, our accelerating momentum continued especially in Japan, where we dominated the Hakone Ekiden competitive race, seeing a record 84% of participants wearing NIKE. The energy around running in Japan is being fueled by the Vaporfly Next% as well as a halo effect that is impacting other performance models like the Zoom Fly, Rival Fly and Peg Turbo, which all grew triple digits in Q3.
NIKE Digital grew 51%, and wholesale grew double digits overall on a currency-neutral basis as business with our differentiated strategic partners grew 5x as fast as undifferentiated distribution. As we've said, APLA is our most diverse geography, so we are seeing the impact of COVID-19 vary significantly across Asian and Latin American countries. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China. While our full quarter results in Greater China were significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is worth providing some dimension. Our momentum in China continued to be extraordinary through mid-January. Our revenue growth was on track to exceed the expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by NIKE Digital. We launched the Nike App in China in Q3, and today, we already have 5 million Nike App downloads. And as John said, we're also seeing a spike in weekly average users on our activity apps as we inspire and enable consumers to engage in sport at home. 
We're now, as I said, through the recovery phase and into the normalization period in China. Today, our digital commerce growth continues to accelerate, with triple-digit growth in demand just this last week. Most of our stores and our partner stores are open; retail traffic is significantly accelerating week-over-week; and we're beginning to see a decline from the peak inventory levels we experienced. We are confident that NIKE Greater China is on track to return to growth in fiscal year '21.
As we look ahead, we will not be providing financial guidance for Q4 due to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19. For fiscal year '21, we have been planning performance in line with our long-term financial model. The year-over-year growth rate base comparisons will no longer be meaningful. So we'll share the approach that we're taking with respect to fiscal year '21 on our next earnings call.
All of that said, we are confident that executing our operational plan will position NIKE for a return to profitable capital-efficient growth. That will happen over time as each country addresses COVID-19 at a different pace. But our confidence in the return to growth is founded on the relatively rapid recovery and early signs of normalization we are already seeing in China, Korea and Japan.
In these challenging times, NIKE's competitive advantages are showing up as extraordinary resilience. As we emerge from these challenges, those same competitive advantages will show up as strength and brand distinction. Those unique strengths include NIKE's deep, authentic connection to consumers, our pipeline of innovative products, our financial strength and capacity, our industry-leading digital capabilities, our strong partnerships and most importantly our talented and committed teams around the world. I would not trade NIKE's team or position with anybody.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

Why don't I take the first part of the question? Maybe, Andy, you take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports, professional sports leagues and now the Olympics, have put things on hold. And they're doing, I think, what's appropriate by prioritizing the health and safety of their athletes and fans, and we're very supportive of that. And we look forward to when organized sport will be back and running. And when they are, we'll be there. 
But I think it's important to separate those sporting events and our innovation pipeline because we will continue to move forward in our innovation pipeline. And as I said earlier, we're very excited about the products in that pipeline and the products we're introducing, in fact, more excited than perhaps any time before. And while we announced some of these products around the Olympics, if the Olympics gets deferred for a year, we can still launch them on our timing. So 2 specific examples. As you know, the Next% performance running line will allow runners of all abilities to have the same technology and measurable benefits of the Alphafly Next% that the world's leading marathoners have. And we can launch that when the time is right, unrelated to the Olympics. Similarly, some of the sustainability products we announced at the forum, the VaporMax 2020, which utilizes 75% recycled manufacturing waste, or the Space Hippie line, which is an innovative way to have low-carbon footprint footwear, we can launch when the time is right, when we get to the recovery and normalization periods. And so consumer demand for those things is strong and will continue to be strong. And so we simply are going to move ahead with our product pipeline at the right moments in the right ways.
I'll just make one small final example before turning it over to Andy. In China, we got creative, and we took a couple of launches that were scheduled in February and made them digital-only launches. So the Air Jordan Retro High OG and the Air Jordan 5 Retro, we made digital-only launches in a world where stores are closed and -- but digital demand is strong. So we're going to proceed full speed ahead with that product pipeline. 
Andy, do you want to talk about the second part of the question?"

And what we'll be doing is working on the timing of the launch of those products and the flow of those products over time, so that while we're working through energy, we're -- and working through inventory, we're also bringing distinctive energy to the market and to consumers. 
You asked about our licensed business. Just for context, our licensed business is a very low single-digit percentage of our overall business. We'll have some impact on that business. I'd say, just keep in mind that a lot of these elite sporting activities or events are being postponed versus necessarily canceled. Although some of them have been canceled. But one of the things we recognize around here is our product -- some of our product has a little bit longer life cycle. And come fall, we think we could be kicking off one of the greatest years in sports history.
Now you also asked about SG&A. So from an SG&A perspective, the short answer is we've got quite a bit of flexibility within our SG&A. And that's one of the reasons you saw us deliver profitability even in Q3, when we were all a bit taken off guard by the significant impact of COVID-19, we were still able to deliver profitability that exceeded the guidance we set 90 days ago. As I also mentioned, based on some quick and agile work across our cross-functional teams, we see SG&A in Q4 declining versus prior year. There's quite a bit of flexibility in demand creation. And actually, it ties back to your question about sport. As John mentioned in his remarks, we've done some really creative things from a digital connectivity perspective with huge impact. So quick, low-cost, extraordinary impact. And we think within demand creation, we can save quite a bit of our powder for the return to sport that we see within fiscal year '21.
Within SG&A, our liquidity and our access to capital allows us within SG&A to stay very principled. So continued pay continuity, as John talked about. And at the same time, continuing to invest in those things that even now more than ever, we see as differentiators long term, albeit, we'll do it in a more focused way. So beyond that, there are quite a bit of opportunities with operating overhead and CapEx. And when I said our team has just been amazing in terms of their resilience and creativity, it actually includes in terms of tightly managing our cost."

So one of the real advantages, as you said, of NIKE being a scaled global company is we can extract learning and insight from each of our markets. And so here's what we've seen, just to quickly recap what Andy and I talked about. We're looking at things through the lens of 4 phases to this: containment of the outbreak, first; second, recovery period when stores reopen; third, normalization when things get back to growth from the prior year; and then fourth, return to growth. And the data from actually China, Japan and Korea was fairly consistent. Containment took 5 to 6 weeks. Stores were closed but the e-commerce growth in all 3 markets remained strong during that time, augmented by NIKE connecting with consumers around being active while at home. Now all 3 markets are through what we're calling recovery, that is retail is opening back up. Consumers are back on the streets. And we're seeing, as we move into normalization, retail traffic is coming back. Consumers are in the stores. They're engaged. They're often wearing face masks, but they're back on the street. 
Interestingly, digital has accelerated even more since the stores have been open. Again, I think pointing to this blended digital versus physical experience is a thing of the past. Consumers don't think in those terms. So I bring a sort of consumer technology lens, where we learned that consumers want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. And they don't think about, oh, I'm going to make a digital purchase or a physical purchase. A consumer may often start shopping on their mobile device, they may go into a store and have it shipped at home, they may order online and pick it up in a store. And what we're seeing in Japan, China and Korea is that seamless digital-physical experience is responding to what consumers want.
And I might note as our business comes back in those 3 markets, we're outperforming our competition, consistent with a mantra of ensuring that we come through this period in an even stronger position and extend our leadership position. So in the U.S., obviously, we're in much -- we're earlier in the cycle. We've closed the stores. We're taking care of our employees. We digitally connected with consumers over the weekend around health and their activity. So our brand is present day in and day out with them. As Andy mentioned, we're seeing very strong digital growth, even in these dark days. And we're managing our inventory so that we can be ready when recovery comes. We can't -- none of us can't predict perfectly how long the containment phase is going to take in the U.S. and Europe. But what we can know is when stores start reopening -- or while stores are closed, we're going to be there digitally. We're going to be there digitally with activity apps and commerce. And when the stores start reopening, we're going to be leveraging our strengths, our unique strengths, with strong compelling product, a digital connection with consumers that is unmatched, these seamless digital and physical experiences at both NIKE Direct and our partners. We're working very closely with our partners. And in fact, in the last 3 days, I've talked to the CEOs of Zalando, JD, Foot Locker, in the last couple of months, met with DICK's CEO, the CEOs of our 2 Chinese partners, we're working together to be ready when things recover and then our brand. 
So I think it's going to accelerate what was already going to happen with digital transformation. Consumers will continue, digital is a more prominent role in their lives. You'll see more digital growth. And I think the shape of the future marketplace where differentiated retail thrives, undifferentiated retail struggles. That will simply be accelerated. So we intend to drive both."

And so -- and we engage with them both around their physical stores and around online. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with the CEO of Zalando, who is obviously a very -- Zalando's a very innovative e-commerce company in Europe, and we are sharing data in very innovative ways around consumers so that we can offer the best experiences to consumers in a differentiated way in the markets across Europe. And so the conversations around the future, I think all of them see the same blended or seamless digital and physical experience together that we're committed to creating. And I think we all believe that this is going to become an era of differentiated retail versus undifferentiated, and they see opportunity. We have to work through this challenging period together, which we will. But I think all of them see the opportunity to emerge stronger and to accelerate the transformation of the marketplace.

So Jamie, what I'd say is while, obviously, there are some elements of these current circumstances that are unprecedented, we came into this circumstance with a strategy. And you know our strategy was 2X Direct. That was a strategy that was not a NIKE-only strategy. It was really focused on driving more direct connections with our consumers leveraging digital, both in our own stores, online and with our partners and through their online presence. That's accelerating for everyone right now. So if you think about the North America marketplace and Europe, with most stores closed, both our own stores and most of our retail partners, what is really accelerating is that perspective and -- on the opportunities to connect with consumers digitally from a brand perspective, but also expand our ability to connect with consumers from a product and service perspective. 
When we say partnership, it's not just transactional. It's not a back-and-forth transactional type of dialogue with our partners. We're talking to our partners about both how we come through this period and then what we build for the long term. And there are a couple of things that we're building. We're all expanding our digital pipe, so to speak. We, in North America, have already doubled the ability, the capacity to distribute product one-to-one to consumers through our distribution centers in just several days. So it's really accelerating what we saw as the future in terms of digital penetration. 
From an inventory perspective, right now, digital is the -- is where the water is flowing, so to speak, or where the product is flowing. And so we're working closely in partnership with folks like Zalando in Europe, as John mentioned. We already had an inventory partnership program with Zalando where we transact via their site and ours, via their digital ecosystem and our digital ecosystem while leveraging each other's inventory. And we're working with our partners in the U.S. in a similar regard, managing the inventory they have on hand, the inventory we have on hand relative to them and how best to flow that through their digital pipes as well as ours. 
So I think in summary, what I'd say is, as John said, it's accelerating quite a bit of change in consumer behavior. It's also accelerating quite a bit of change in our partners' behavior."

I'll take that question, Alexandra. I think what we're finding is that there are several levers from the perspective of resetting inventory or supply, as one might say, relative to the pace of expansion in digital demand, the reopening of stores and then the amount of traffic going to those stores and the amount of conversion. And so there isn't a sort of one size fits all or not just one lever. So what we're doing with our own inventory and with our partners is we're looking at a lot of different levers. We're looking at realigning our product offer dates. So not only do we have some inventory going into these circumstances, but we've got a great pipeline of products. And we can move some of those product offer dates out to some extent as we work through the inventory that we'll build over these weeks in which we're dealing with these circumstances in each market. 
We are primarily talking to our partners about managing inventory movement, the generation -- and the generation of cash flow with a view towards getting back to 14 to 16 weeks or so on hand in the market and 14 weeks or so on hand of inventory for NIKE and strong full-price sell-through. Some of the levers we'll employ in that regard will impact gross margin negatively. That's somewhat obvious. That could be promotion. It could be cancellation of orders. At the same time, none of those data points will represent a trend. 
So what you're likely to see in the near term is a focus on supply and demand management. That will impact revenue, may have a negative -- will have a negative impact on margin, but that is part and parcel goes with resetting that foundation for strong profitable growth. It's not a new trend. It's not a reflection of the strength of our product. In fact, John mentioned some of the launches we've had in China. We've actually had some product launches here in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks that have sold through at full price. So it will be a blend of working through inventory, which does have some impact on margin, and a blend of bringing innovation and fresh, compelling new product to consumers, who are probably will be looking for energy and inspiration and optimism."

Andy mentioned the growth in New York, growth in L.A. being double digit. And that is because both with NIKE Direct and with our partners, we're getting closer to the consumer. And I'll just take a couple of examples. I had a chance to visit the Foot Locker very innovative store in Washington Heights neighborhood in New York, where the entire display of the inventory and the merchandise and the whole focus is being of the neighborhood. And you can just see consumers responding. And that store is experiencing significantly greater growth than other comparable stores that Foot Locker has in the area. So it's a great example of differentiated retail and the future of retail. 
We're doing the same with some of the Latino communities in L.A., providing retail concepts, both through NIKE Direct and with our partners that are getting close to what consumers want in those markets and give a more personalized feel. And when you wrap that around with a digital connection, with membership and the other digital tools, you can feel the energy and momentum. And so I think at its core, the key city strategy that NIKE has put in place in the U.S. and beyond is absolutely paying dividends."

So we think we'll emerge even stronger. 
For a little bit of context on the strength we had entering this fourth quarter, NIKE Digital continues to fuel strong growth in North America, up a relatively extraordinary 33% in the quarter. We've talked to you about the significant opportunity that we think in terms of the women's business. Our women's business grew at a rate that was nearly double that of men's, both in footwear and apparel, so we're seeing strong growth there. Now across footwear and apparel, our growth was relatively balanced, both in the mid-single digits, and that's even taking into account the divestiture of Hurley, which was a largely apparel business and the shift in our business model with respect to the NFL, which is also largely an apparel business. So what you can infer from that, as we've told you, we think we have an epic growth opportunity in digital, in women's and in apparel. And when you take into account those noncomparables in the quarter, all 3, including apparel, are over-indexing in terms of growth. 
So again, we feel great about the position, of strength we had and have from a brand perspective as we work through these challenges. And we'll be doing everything we can in terms of managing demand and supply and fueling our brand so that we emerge even stronger."

Over the last quarter, Nike delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of our geographies and categories. But let's take a step back. We're living in an unprecedented moment. And like never before, each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we will respond. So let me tell you what we've seen over the past 2 months.
When COVID-19 began to aggressively spread across China in late January, our top priority was to protect the health and safety of our teammates and our consumers. We immediately began closing stores. And as of 45 days ago, we had closed more than 5,000 stores in Greater China while the remaining open doors were operating with severely reduced hours. Not surprisingly, retail volume in China plummeted, but we acted quickly and decisively, leveraging our diverse sourcing base and digital capabilities to manage the business with flexibility and shifting our inventory to serve consumer digital demand.
At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network to inspire and support consumers across China to stay active and connected while at home. As a result, our Nike Training Club workouts in China saw an extraordinary rise in sign up and engagement. In fact, our weekly active users for all of our NIKE activity apps were up 80% by the end of Q3 versus the beginning of the quarter. And here's what happened. The strong engagement of Chinese consumers with our activity apps translated into strong engagement with our NIKE commerce app. As a result, our digital business in China grew more than 30% and maintained strong momentum throughout this challenging period, a powerful statement of NIKE's agile problem-solving in times of disruption.
Then approximately 30 days ago, we began to gradually reopen stores in China. People got back to work, and retail traffic began improving significantly. Today, nearly 80% of our stores in China have reopened, with more coming back online every day. In fact, just last week, we reopened our first store in the Wuhan area. And the results are encouraging. Our digital business in China has accelerated even further over the past month, and we are now seeing double-digit increases in retail traffic week-over-week with some stores having already returned to prior year levels. Credit for this response goes to Angela Dong, who leads our Greater China geography and her talented team of more than 1,600. I spoke with Angela 2 nights ago, and she has been telling me about the positive sentiment consumers in China are feeling for NIKE, and I can't overstate how impressed I am. It's become quite clear to me that when NIKE says we are a brand of China for China, it's really true. And it's no surprise to see the business already rebounding given the depth of our connection and the incredible strength of our local leadership team.
So today, I can say that we're seeing the other side of the crisis in China. And due to the resilience and creativity of our team in China, we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere. In addition to Greater China, we've applied that playbook in Japan and South Korea over the past 2 months, and we're seeing early momentum in those markets as well. And with COVID-19 now spreading across Europe and the U.S., we are applying the same playbook. We have prioritized the health and safety of our teammates, and we have closed our stores. Over the weekend, we drove a strong digital marketing campaign to engage consumers across Europe and across the U.S. to stay healthy and connected while they're at home. And our digital commerce remains open and in growth mode, supported by our teammates in our distribution centers.
We also know that this is a moment in society where the private sector has a major role to play. Companies like NIKE need to do our part. So our teams in innovation and manufacturing are exploring designs for personal protective equipment, or PPE, to support doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of this outbreak. Based on needs identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health and Science University, our teammates are working right now about how to best help, including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others. It's been so energizing to see the quick strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need.
That said, we expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period for those living in the U.S. and Europe. And I can't precisely predict how long the containment phase of the outbreak will last. But our experience in China, Japan and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future. And I can assure you this, as the situation continues to evolve, we will be ready, and we will respond. We'll be guided by our values, and we will execute with empathy and with decisiveness.
For instance, we'll continue to maintain pay continuity even while our facilities are closed or have altered schedules. We know that our people are vital to fueling our deep connections with consumers, whether they work in our stores or our distribution centers. And what's more, it's simply the right thing to do. So while this is an uncertain and challenging time, NIKE has the foundation in place to emerge from it stronger than ever. Thanks to our competitive advantages, the power of our brand in connection with consumers, our digital capabilities, our compelling product innovation and most importantly our extraordinary team, we will manage our business back to full recovery. We know in times like these that strong brands get even stronger. And I truly believe that no one is better equipped than NIKE to navigate the current climate. 
So with that said, let's go a bit deeper. I spent the last 90 days digging into this extraordinary company. I thought I knew NIKE after 5 years on the board, but believe me, when you get to dive even deeper, this place is even more impressive than I imagined. Let me walk you through what I've learned through the lens of the 4 strengths I just mentioned: our strong brand, our digital advantage, our product innovation and our extraordinary team. These are the strengths that will continue to set us apart, and these are the strengths that will allow us to shape the future marketplace going forward. 
Since I started as CEO in January, I have visited with our teams in several of our key cities, experiencing firsthand our deep connections with local consumers around the world as well as our innovative retail concepts. I've also had the opportunity to meet with many of our most important strategic partners. During my first week as CEO in early January, I spent time in China and Japan before the virus took hold. I got to see firsthand just how deeply the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands are connecting with consumers, both in compelling retail executions and in the many ways that NIKE partners with regional, local governments to grow physical activity and sports. Our brand is driving these powerful connections to consumers worldwide. In fact, we were the #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in Q3, and we continue to gain market share in key cities, such as Berlin, Mexico City and Tokyo.
And during a time of physical store closures around the world, we know that our digital foundation will help us emerge out of this situation in an even stronger position. For instance, in Q3, digital delivered 36% currency-neutral growth, and it will continue to be a powerful driver of our deep consumer connections. As I mentioned early, we are executing our learnings from China about fueling sport and fitness all over the world. We're using our digital advantage to connect with and support our consumers as behaviors around staying healthy at home continue to evolve.
Over the weekend, we made the NTC premium free for everyone in the U.S. for 90 days. NTC premium offers the best on-demand workouts and expert tips from our master trainers and others as well as inspiration and support for healthy living. Digital remains our fastest-growing channel, with owned and partnered digital already representing more than 20% of our overall business. And our apps continue to be the sharp point of our growth. With the Nike App growing revenue close to triple digits once again in Q3, fueling member acquisition and strong monthly engagement. And while we've driven impressive results, acquiring new members, engaging them and fueling increased digital demand, we know that the opportunity here is still far greater than what we've realized to date and will become an even greater advantage for NIKE as we move forward.
And even while our stores remain closed in Europe and the U.S., we continue to work on defining the future of seamless physical and digital retail. To expand the advantage we have in digital, we continue to invest in our NIKE Direct businesses, enhancing rich experiences like those in the Nike App at Retail. And we are increasingly concentrating on our online to off-line journey and accelerating our work to fully connect the marketplace while creating frictionless experiences for consumers throughout the world.
Another clear competitive advantage is our product innovation. Our product and innovation have always set NIKE apart from others, and I firmly believe this will become even more important of a differentiator as we look ahead. Over the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with our innovation, design, product and merchandising teams. I've done several deep dives in these areas, and I am truly blown away. As a Board member, you get to see a lot, but you can never fully understand how impressive NIKE's product innovation capability is until you spend time with our teams.
For instance, today, we have more than 1,000 designers working at NIKE, with broad and deep talent across footwear and apparel. And you can just feel how their creativity and vision for product inspires everyone here and inspires consumers around the world. I got to see some of this innovative product on display at the Nike 2020 Forum last month in New York, which served as a great illustration of the power of our 2X Innovation offense. There, we announced a powerful array of breakthrough products, such as our Next% footwear line which offers measurable benefits to consumers. We also launched a new aesthetic for sustainability where we're delivering new scalable platforms like no one else. And by bringing together athletes and creative partners as only NIKE can, the forum was an optimistic statement about the future of sport culture.
And our advantage goes beyond our incredible product pipeline. It has become even more clear to me why NIKE leads the industry. Our innovation, product and design teams have an unrelenting commitment to discovering what's next. This culture of innovation is pervasive across our organization and deeply embedded within NIKE teams around the world. From those who engage consumers at retail, to those creating the next wave of digital experiences that connect with consumers daily. Fueled by data and analytics capabilities, we are equipped with deep consumer insight that we combine with our design expertise and athlete research. This process directly translates into breakthrough product season after season, allowing us to drive more separation in the marketplace.
There's one last thing I'd like to mention. As you know, the organized sports world remains on hold and yet the global culture of health and wellness continues unabated. In fact, in many ways, people are looking to health and wellness now more than ever. Whether it's to stay in shape at home or with a focus on mental health in stressful times, people all over the globe are finding ways to make sport a daily habit wherever, whenever and however they can. And as you may have seen, this past weekend, we encouraged consumers worldwide to work out at home with a simple message: Play inside, play for the world.
We're seeing new behaviors normalize in countries all over the globe, and we're shifting our entire consumer ecosystem to deliver access to sports that speaks to consumers' changing lives. Across key markets, we're working to create shared experiences and opportunity for virtual participation, connecting people to something bigger and showing how sport can inspire. And though there's no predicting when organized sports will restart when our athletes, teams and leagues can return to competition, I do have one guarantee. When the gates reopen, when the first whistle sounds, the energy is going to be off the charts. The world's passion for sports remains undiminished. And when it all returns, NIKE will be right there with sports fans everywhere.
In summary, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q3. And amidst unprecedented conditions across the globe, we are staying focused on not simply managing through this situation but taking the actions that will allow us to emerge from it even stronger than before. We know it won't be easy, but NIKE is better prepared than anyone else to regain that momentum, extend our brand leadership and reshape the future marketplace.
NIKE has a long history of rising to the occasion in extraordinary times to deliver strong results and effect extraordinary change in the world of sport and beyond. And that's what we're going to do once again.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy."

Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the busin",2673,"Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is, first and foremost, our people. Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the business decisions we're making.
We have a maxim at NIKE, we win as a team. And I can tell you that the resilience, strength, empathy and creativity of our teammates has never been on greater display. Our team has always been NIKE's greatest advantage. On that note, I want to congratulate one of my teammates, Matt Friend, on his new role going forward. Matt and I have worked closely together since he joined NIKE 11 years ago. He's been a great thought partner to me over that time, and we're working seamlessly together through this transition. As I move into my new role with NIKE, I could not be more confident in NIKE's financial management with Matt as our CFO.
So as we close Q3 and look ahead, we see 3 key themes. First, as we enter these challenging circumstances, NIKE's brand leadership and business momentum have been stronger than ever and unrivaled around the world. In Q3, we delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth overall, led by 13% growth in both EMEA and APLA. NIKE Greater China was also on pace to deliver another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth prior to the impact of COVID-19. And in North America, our strong mid-single-digit reported rate of revenue growth would have been roughly 3 points higher if not for noncomparable items, including the sale of Hurley and our shift to a licensed business model with Fanatics relative to the NFL. While those transactions had a negative impact on our year-over-year revenue growth comparisons, they also result in higher profitability for NIKE.
Across all of our geographies and Converse, digital remained our fastest-growing channel, growing 36% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact, each of our geographies and Converse exceeded 30% digital revenue growth in the quarter. Our growth was also broad-based across categories as well as across women's and men's, all fueled by innovation platforms and power franchises such as the Air Max 270, the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. Our launch of the Air Jordan 11 ""Bred"" was the largest in our history with the product selling out in 28 minutes powered by the SNKRS App. In fact, the Jordan Brand grew double digits globally in the quarter.
The LeBron 17, Giannis Zoom Freak and the City Edition NBA jerseys fueled basketball's strong growth. And in running, we unveiled our most advanced performance running shoe ever, the Alphafly Next%. We also launched the new Infinity React, designed to help runners run longer, and we've seen very strong sell-through, particularly with women.
Apparel also fueled growth in the quarter, growing faster than footwear, with double-digit apparel growth in our sportswear, training, basketball, women's and kids' categories.
Setting aside the noncash nonrecurring charges related to our business model changes in South America, NIKE, Inc.'s earnings exceeded the earnings that were implied in the financial guidance we provided 90 days ago. We were able to deliver that strong bottom line performance, even including the impact of COVID-19 on Greater China.
The second key theme as we look ahead, relates to how we're addressing the evolving implications of COVID-19. As John said, we are executing on an operational playbook focused on positioning NIKE for an expedited return to profitable, capital-efficient growth. We see each of our markets progressing through a time series that begins with the country addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by 3 phases from a business perspective: one, a recovery period, including, for example, the ramp-up of store reopenings; two, a period of normalization across consumer demand and supply; and three, a period in which we return to strong growth.
Why are we so confident in our approach? Well, as John said, our team in Greater China has given us a playbook for the rest of the world. Based upon the most recent trends we see today, NIKE Greater China has already progressed through the recovery phase and is now transitioning into the normalization phase. Specifically, we are seeing accelerating strong double-digit, approaching triple-digit growth in our NIKE Digital business. At the same time, roughly 80% of our 7,000 brick-and-mortar NIKE-owned and partner stores are now open. Based on the latest trends in our business, NIKE Greater China Q4 revenue will likely be roughly flat versus Q4 of fiscal year '19.
We're also executing on this playbook in Japan and Korea. Both markets are entering the normalization phase, fueled by strong digital growth and significant week-over-week increases in retail traffic and demand for NIKE. Based on what we're experiencing in China, Korea and Japan, we are optimistic. At the same time, this has become a global pandemic. Each country is addressing COVID-19 differently. And accordingly, our markets will progress through the 3 phases from a business perspective on different time lines. That adds some complexity from a global point of view. So we're also executing against a top-down enterprise-wide operational plan.
Our top-down plan includes: one, tight cost management; and two, daily global demand and supply optimization. Accordingly, our Q4 SG&A will be lower than prior year Q4 spending. We're also taking decisive action with respect to supply on a global basis, while shifting our distribution focus to digital in the face of temporary retail store closures. As a result, Q4 fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '21 year-over-year revenue, margin and inventory growth rates will neither be intuitive nor linear. Our measures of success in the near term will be rooted in the amount of inventory on-hand relative to the pace of digital demand, store reopenings and traffic patterns.
Now going into this, we were fortunately experiencing a very strong pull market for NIKE globally, with some of the highest rates of full-price sell-through we have ever experienced. So we're now aggressively managing all of our operating levers to ensure that we expedite NIKE's return to that strong full market. Realigning supply and demand is our focus operationally.
We're also executing this plan leveraging 2 of NIKE's long-standing and greatest competitive advantages. First, Nike's financial strength. Liquidity will not be an issue for NIKE. In order to ensure resilience during challenging times, we have long maintained a strong balance sheet, a strong investment-grade credit rating and ample access to capital, all coupled with strong operating cash flow generation. NIKE's liquidity and access to capital affords us the ability to be principled, for example, with respect to pay continuity, and decisive relative to real-time supply and demand management. 
Second, we have forged the strongest partnerships across the value chain in this industry. That includes, among others, our marketplace partners like Topsports, Pou Sheng and Tmall in China as well as Foot Locker, DICK'S, JD and Zalando across the U.S. and Europe. Of course, we also have long-standing partnerships that span decades with manufacturers such as Feng Tay, Shenzhou, Chang Shin and many others. We're working closely with all of these strategic partners on a daily basis. Our partners recognize that the stronger NIKE is going forward, the stronger they are. Of course, NIKE is not operating in isolation. External factors will continue to be dynamic, and we will continue to adjust our execution accordingly. 
The third key theme as we look forward. While the setbacks from a business perspective will be significant for all, NIKE will come back even stronger as a brand and as a company. Consumer behavior is changing real time. We're all witnessing new normals emerge in terms of both how consumers shop and stay active. Sport is being redefined as much broader than competition as the world finds new and creative ways to stay healthy and fit. And NIKE's digital ecosystem is keeping us connected real time. From a marketplace perspective, NIKE Digital growth is accelerating amidst these dynamics.
From a digital capability perspective, the investments we've made to date are now proving to be the foundation for our resilience amidst challenge, and they will be strength as we emerge. For example, we're leveraging select team and tools to dynamically model demand, pricing, planning and allocation; we're leveraging our NIKE membership platform and NIKE mobile app ecosystem to inspire and enable people to be active at home, while also providing targeted product offers and services to consumers. And the foundation we've built in enterprise data and analytics is fueling our more agile end-to-end execution.
As we've said, we're still in the early innings of NIKE's digital transformation. But the capabilities we've already been building for the future are proving to be the strongest pillars within our business today. As John said, simply put, these are times in which strong brands get stronger, and we're confident that NIKE will come back stronger than ever.
Now let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 5%, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong balanced growth across EMEA, APLA, North America and Greater China prior to the impact of COVID-19, all fueled by Nike digital growing 36% versus prior year. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points in Q3 as higher average selling prices and better off-price margin were offset by the impact of COVID-19 primarily in Greater China as we managed inventory sell-through in that market. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX headwinds and incremental tariffs in North America.
SG&A grew 6% in Q3. We continue to invest in our digital transformation, while also beginning to more tightly manage operating overhead and shift demand creation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 3.9% compared to 14.7% for the same period last year due to a shift in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S. and increased benefits from discrete items.
Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.53, including the $0.25 noncash nonrecurring FX-related charge associated with the transition of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic distributor models.
As of February 29, inventories were up 7% compared to the prior period reflecting healthy full-price versus off-price mix prior to the impacts of COVID-19. 
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, which again would have been approximately 3 points higher adjusting for the sale of Hurley and our partnership with Fanatics regarding the NFL business. In Q3, NIKE Digital grew over 30% and the Nike App grew over 60% in North America. New York City and L.A. each grew double digits, fueled by differentiated NIKE consumer experiences. As an example, in L.A., we launched our newest Nike Live concept store in Glendale, which blew passed our expectations, and significantly over-indexed in terms of the women's business.
Now as of today, we've closed our own stores in North America. Going forward, we will reopen stores on a location-by-location basis as we closely monitor developments. At the same time, NIKE Digital demand has been extraordinary, with NIKE Digital commerce sales over just the past few days approaching holiday peak levels, growing triple digits over just the past week. We've maintained operations in our distribution centers, implementing social distancing and reduced staffing, while focusing on the shipment of digital orders.
Now let's turn to EMEA, where we continue to build on our extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit growth in most key categories. Women's growth strongly outpaced men's, apparel accelerated faster than footwear, and digital was up over 40%. The NIKE Brand has never been stronger in EMEA. In every key city in EMEA, consumers rated NIKE their #1 favorite and cool brand.
We also gained significant market share in Q3 across both footwear and apparel, driving further brand separation. Greater speed and agility also fueled our growth and share gains in EMEA in Q3, with over 30% of EMEA revenue and nearly 80% of EMEA incremental growth flowing through our Express Lane. In order to help limit the spread of COVID-19, we have also closed our own stores in Western Europe and select Eastern European markets. And similar to the U.S., we will reopen on a location-by-location basis based on developments.
NIKE Digital continues to grow versus prior year, and we're maintaining operations in our distribution centers, again, shifting their focus towards digital distribution.
In our APLA geography, revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by our key cities and was balanced across key categories, nearly all of which were up double digits. The Jordan Brand, in particular, was incredibly strong in APLA, growing nearly 50% in the quarter, with new innovation like the Jordan Max 200, along with fresh new approaches to Jordan icons all resonating with consumers.
In performance running, our accelerating momentum continued especially in Japan, where we dominated the Hakone Ekiden competitive race, seeing a record 84% of participants wearing NIKE. The energy around running in Japan is being fueled by the Vaporfly Next% as well as a halo effect that is impacting other performance models like the Zoom Fly, Rival Fly and Peg Turbo, which all grew triple digits in Q3.
NIKE Digital grew 51%, and wholesale grew double digits overall on a currency-neutral basis as business with our differentiated strategic partners grew 5x as fast as undifferentiated distribution. As we've said, APLA is our most diverse geography, so we are seeing the impact of COVID-19 vary significantly across Asian and Latin American countries. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China. While our full quarter results in Greater China were significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is worth providing some dimension. Our momentum in China continued to be extraordinary through mid-January. Our revenue growth was on track to exceed the expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by NIKE Digital. We launched the Nike App in China in Q3, and today, we already have 5 million Nike App downloads. And as John said, we're also seeing a spike in weekly average users on our activity apps as we inspire and enable consumers to engage in sport at home. 
We're now, as I said, through the recovery phase and into the normalization period in China. Today, our digital commerce growth continues to accelerate, with triple-digit growth in demand just this last week. Most of our stores and our partner stores are open; retail traffic is significantly accelerating week-over-week; and we're beginning to see a decline from the peak inventory levels we experienced. We are confident that NIKE Greater China is on track to return to growth in fiscal year '21.
As we look ahead, we will not be providing financial guidance for Q4 due to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19. For fiscal year '21, we have been planning performance in line with our long-term financial model. The year-over-year growth rate base comparisons will no longer be meaningful. So we'll share the approach that we're taking with respect to fiscal year '21 on our next earnings call.
All of that said, we are confident that executing our operational plan will position NIKE for a return to profitable capital-efficient growth. That will happen over time as each country addresses COVID-19 at a different pace. But our confidence in the return to growth is founded on the relatively rapid recovery and early signs of normalization we are already seeing in China, Korea and Japan.
In these challenging times, NIKE's competitive advantages are showing up as extraordinary resilience. As we emerge from these challenges, those same competitive advantages will show up as strength and brand distinction. Those unique strengths include NIKE's deep, authentic connection to consumers, our pipeline of innovative products, our financial strength and capacity, our industry-leading digital capabilities, our strong partnerships and most importantly our talented and committed teams around the world. I would not trade NIKE's team or position with anybody.
With that, we'll now open up the call for questions."

And then the second piece of it is just can you elaborate a little more on how flexible your spending is, your demand creation that you sort of had planned for the next, let's call it, 6 months."
291981,656220026,1946739,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2020",2020-03-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Bob. It's John. Why don't I take the first part of the question? Maybe, Andy, you take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports, professional sports leagues and now the Olympics, have put things on hold. And they're doing, I thi",394,"Sure, Bob. It's John. Why don't I take the first part of the question? Maybe, Andy, you take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports, professional sports leagues and now the Olympics, have put things on hold. And they're doing, I think, what's appropriate by prioritizing the health and safety of their athletes and fans, and we're very supportive of that. And we look forward to when organized sport will be back and running. And when they are, we'll be there. 
But I think it's important to separate those sporting events and our innovation pipeline because we will continue to move forward in our innovation pipeline. And as I said earlier, we're very excited about the products in that pipeline and the products we're introducing, in fact, more excited than perhaps any time before. And while we announced some of these products around the Olympics, if the Olympics gets deferred for a year, we can still launch them on our timing. So 2 specific examples. As you know, the Next% performance running line will allow runners of all abilities to have the same technology and measurable benefits of the Alphafly Next% that the world's leading marathoners have. And we can launch that when the time is right, unrelated to the Olympics. Similarly, some of the sustainability products we announced at the forum, the VaporMax 2020, which utilizes 75% recycled manufacturing waste, or the Space Hippie line, which is an innovative way to have low carbon footprint footwear, we can launch when the time is right, when we get to the recovery and normalization periods. And so consumer demand for those things is strong and will continue to be strong. And so we simply are going to move ahead with our product pipeline at the right moments in the right ways.
I'll just make one small final example before turning it over to Andy. In China, we got creative, and we took a couple of launches that were scheduled in February and made them digital-only launches. So the Air Jordan Retro High OG and the Air Jordan 5 Retro, we made digital-only launches in a world where stores are closed and -- but digital demand is strong. So we're going to proceed full speed ahead with that product pipeline. 
Andy, do you want to talk about the second part of the question?"
291981,656220026,1946739,"NIKE, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2020",2020-03-24,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Yes. I'd just say, just to summarize some of what both John and I said in the remarks and John just reiterated, we came into these circumstances in an incredibly strong position.

I'd just say, just to summarize some of what both John and I said in the remarks and John just reiterated, we came into these circumstances in an incredibly strong position. Some of the highest full-price sell-through we've seen. Inventory is really healthy. As we go forward, we recognize that there will be some promotion in the marketplace. But as John said, we've also got an amazing pipeline of innovative and compelling fresh products. And what we'll be doing is working on the timing of the launch of those products and the flow of those products over time, so that while we're working through energy, we're -- and working through inventory, we're also bringing distinctive energy to the market and to consumers. 
You asked about our licensed business. Just for context, our licensed business is a very low single-digit percentage of our overall business. We'll have some impact on that business. I'd say, just keep in mind that a lot of these elite sporting activities or events are being postponed versus necessarily canceled. Although some of them have been canceled. But one of the things we recognize around here is our product -- some of our product has a little bit longer life cycle. And come fall, we think we could be kicking off one of the greatest years in sports history.
Now you also asked about SG&A. So from an SG&A perspective, the short answer is we've got quite a bit of flexibility within our SG&A. And that's one of the reasons you saw us deliver profitability even in Q3, when we were all a bit taken off guard by the significant impact of COVID-19, we were still able to deliver profitability that exceeded the guidance we set 90 days ago. As I also mentioned, based on some quick and agile work across our cross-functional teams, we see SG&A in Q4 declining versus prior year. There's quite a bit of flexibility in demand creation. And actually, it ties back to your question about sport. As John mentioned in his remarks, we've done some really creative things from a digital connectivity perspective with huge impact. So quick, low-cost, extraordinary impact. And we think within demand creation, we can save quite a bit of our powder for the return to sport that we see within fiscal year '21.
Within SG&A, our liquidity and our access to capital allows us within SG&A to stay very principled. So continued pay continuity, as John talked about. And at the same time, continuing to invest in those things that even now more than ever, we see as differentiators long term, albeit, we'll do it in a more focused way.

So one of the real advantages, as you said, of NIKE being a scaled global company is we can extract learning and insight from each of our markets. And so here's what we've seen, just to quickly recap what Andy and I talked about. We're looking at things through the lens of 4 phases to this: containment of the outbreak, first; second, recovery period when stores reopen; third, normalization when things get back to growth from the prior year; and then fourth, return to growth. And the data from actually China, Japan and Korea was fairly consistent. Containment took 5 to 6 weeks. Stores were closed but the e-commerce growth in all 3 markets remained strong during that time, augmented by NIKE connecting with consumers around being active while at home. Now all 3 markets are through what we're calling recovery, that is retail is opening back up. Consumers are back on the streets. And we're seeing, as we move into normalization, retail traffic is coming back. Consumers are in the stores. They're engaged. They're often wearing face masks, but they're back on the street. 
Interestingly, digital has accelerated even more since the stores have been open. Again, I think pointing to this blended digital versus physical experience is a thing of the past. Consumers don't think in those terms. So I bring a sort of consumer technology lens, where we learned that consumers want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. And they don't think about, oh, I'm going to make a digital purchase or a physical purchase. A consumer may often start shopping on their mobile device, they may go into a store and have it shipped at home, they may order online and pick it up in a store. And what we're seeing in Japan, China and Korea is that seamless digital-physical experience is responding to what consumers want.
And I might note as our business comes back in those 3 markets, we're outperforming our competition, consistent with a mantra of ensuring that we come through this period in an even stronger position and extend our leadership position. So in the U.S., obviously, we're in much -- we're earlier in the cycle. We've closed the stores. We're taking care of our employees. We digitally connected with consumers over the weekend around health and their activity. So our brand is present day in and day out with them. As Andy mentioned, we're seeing very strong digital growth, even in these dark days. And we're managing our inventory so that we can be ready when recovery comes. We can't -- none of us can't predict perfectly how long the containment phase is going to take in the U.S. and Europe. But what we can know is when stores start reopening -- or while stores are closed, we're going to be there digitally. We're going to be there digitally with activity apps and commerce. And when the stores start reopening, we're going to be leveraging our strengths, our unique strengths, with strong compelling product, a digital connection with consumers that is unmatched, these seamless digital and physical experiences at both NIKE Direct and our partners. We're working very closely with our partners. And in fact, in the last 3 days, I've talked to the CEOs of Zalando, JD, Foot Locker, in the last couple of months, met with DICK's CEO, the CEOs of our 2 Chinese partners, we're working together to be ready when things recover and then our brand. 
So I think it's going to accelerate what was already going to happen with digital transformation. Consumers will continue, digital is a more prominent role in their lives. You'll see more digital growth. And I think the shape of the future marketplace where differentiated retail thrives, undifferentiated retail struggles. That will simply be accelerated. So we intend to drive both."

And so -- and we engage with them both around their physical stores and around online. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with the CEO of Zalando, who is obviously a very -- Zalando's a very innovative e-commerce company in Europe, and we are sharing data in very innovative ways around consumers so that we can offer the best experiences to consumers in a differentiated way in the markets across Europe. And so the conversations around the future, I think all of them see the same blended or seamless digital and physical experience together that we're committed to creating. And I think we all believe that this is going to become an era of differentiated retail versus undifferentiated, and they see opportunity. We have to work through this challenging period together, which we will. But I think all of them see the opportunity to emerge stronger and to accelerate the transformation of the marketplace.

So Jamie, what I'd say is while, obviously, there are some elements of these current circumstances that are unprecedented, we came into this circumstance with a strategy. And you know our strategy was 2X Direct. That was a strategy that was not a NIKE-only strategy. It was really focused on driving more direct connections with our consumers leveraging digital, both in our own stores, online and with our partners and through their online presence. That's accelerating for everyone right now. So if you think about the North America marketplace and Europe, with most stores closed, both our own stores and most of our retail partners, what is really accelerating is that perspective and -- on the opportunities to connect with consumers digitally from a brand perspective, but also expand our ability to connect with consumers from a product and service perspective. 
When we say partnership, it's not just transactional. It's not a back-and-forth transactional type of dialogue with our partners. We're talking to our partners about both how we come through this period and then what we build for the long term. And there are a couple of things that we're building. We're all expanding our digital pipe, so to speak. We, in North America, have already doubled the ability, the capacity to distribute product one-to-one to consumers through our distribution centers in just several days. So it's really accelerating what we saw as the future in terms of digital penetration. 
From an inventory perspective, right now, digital is the -- is where the water is flowing, so to speak, or where the product is flowing. And so we're working closely in partnership with folks like Zalando in Europe, as John mentioned. We already had an inventory partnership program with Zalando where we transact via their site and ours, via their digital ecosystem and our digital ecosystem while leveraging each other's inventory. And we're working with our partners in the U.S. in a similar regard, managing the inventory they have on hand, the inventory we have on hand relative to them and how best to flow that through their digital pipes as well as ours. 
So I think in summary, what I'd say is, as John said, it's accelerating quite a bit of change in consumer behavior. It's also accelerating quite a bit of change in our partners' behavior."

I'll take that question, Alexandra. I think what we're finding is that there are several levers from the perspective of resetting inventory or supply, as one might say, relative to the pace of expansion in digital demand, the reopening of stores and then the amount of traffic going to those stores and the amount of conversion. And so there isn't a sort of one size fits all or not just one lever. So what we're doing with our own inventory and with our partners is we're looking at a lot of different levers. We're looking at realigning our product offer dates. So not only do we have some inventory going into these circumstances, but we've got a great pipeline of products. And we can move some of those product offer dates out to some extent as we work through the inventory that we'll build over these weeks in which we're dealing with these circumstances in each market. 
We are primarily talking to our partners about managing inventory movement, the generation -- and the generation of cash flow with a view towards getting back to 14 to 16 weeks or so on hand in the market and 14 weeks or so on hand of inventory for NIKE and strong full-price sell-through. Some of the levers we'll employ in that regard will impact gross margin negatively. That's somewhat obvious. That could be promotion. It could be cancellation of orders. At the same time, none of those data points will represent a trend. 
So what you're likely to see in the near term is a focus on supply and demand management. That will impact revenue, may have a negative -- will have a negative impact on margin, but that is part and parcel goes with resetting that foundation for strong profitable growth. It's not a new trend. It's not a reflection of the strength of our product. In fact, John mentioned some of the launches we've had in China. We've actually had some product launches here in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks that have sold through at full price. So it will be a blend of working through inventory, which does have some impact on margin, and a blend of bringing innovation and fresh, compelling new product to consumers, who are probably will be looking for energy and inspiration and optimism."

But I've spent time now in several of our markets across the U.S., and I've seen firsthand how NIKE's key city strategy is paying off. Andy mentioned the growth in New York, growth in L.A. being double digit. And that is because both with NIKE Direct and with our partners, we're getting closer to the consumer. And I'll just take a couple of examples. I had a chance to visit the Foot Locker very innovative store in Washington Heights neighborhood in New York, where the entire display of the inventory and the merchandise and the whole focus is being of the neighborhood. And you can just see consumers responding. And that store is experiencing significantly greater growth than other comparable stores that Foot Locker has in the area. So it's a great example of differentiated retail and the future of retail. 
We're doing the same with some of the Latino communities in L.A., providing retail concepts, both through NIKE Direct and with our partners that are getting close to what consumers want in those markets and give a more personalized feel. And when you wrap that around with a digital connection, with membership and the other digital tools, you can feel the energy and momentum. And so I think at its core, the key city strategy that NIKE has put in place in the U.S. and beyond is absolutely paying dividends."

And obviously, one of the things I should say is we are entering these challenging times in a position of strength. And as John said, strong brands get stronger during these times. So we think we'll emerge even stronger. 
For a little bit of context on the strength we had entering this fourth quarter, NIKE Digital continues to fuel strong growth in North America, up a relatively extraordinary 33% in the quarter. We've talked to you about the significant opportunity that we think in terms of the women's business. Our women's business grew at a rate that was nearly double that of men's, both in footwear and apparel, so we're seeing strong growth there. Now across footwear and apparel, our growth was relatively balanced, both in the mid-single digits, and that's even taking into account the divestiture of Hurley, which was a largely apparel business and the shift in our business model with respect to the NFL, which is also largely an apparel business. So what you can infer from that, as we've told you, we think we have an epic growth opportunity in digital, in women's and in apparel. And when you take into account those noncomparables in the quarter, all 3, including apparel, are over-indexing in terms of growth. 
So again, we feel great about the position, of strength we had and have from a brand perspective as we work through these challenges. And we'll be doing everything we can in terms of managing demand and supply and fueling our brand so that we emerge even stronger."

I also want to congratulate Matt on becoming our CFO, and express how deeply confident I am in NIKE's financial management under Matt's leadership.
Before I get into our Q4 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the environment in the U.S. right now. Over the past month, we've seen racial tragedies expose systemic prejudice and injustice in America. And Nike has a long history of standing up against inequality, driven by our values and rooted in the power sport. Today, we are uniting behind our black athletes, teammates and community as NIKE continues to lead with purpose. And we're taking action to help create lasting change to address systemic racism in our society including a combined $140 million commitment from NIKE, Converse, The Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan. And while we continue to lead externally, we also strive to be even better internally to meet the high bar we set for ourselves to be a truly diverse and inclusive company.
We're also continuing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the lives of so many across the globe. And throughout all of this, we have led with our values. We have executed with empathy and decisiveness. We prioritize the health and safety of our teammates by closing stores, offices and other facilities. We committed to provide pay continuity for all of our teammates, even while our facilities remain closed or had altered schedules. And we have maintained this important investment over the past 12 weeks. 
Our innovation teams designed and delivered personal protective equipment to health systems across the country. We donated footwear apparel to help frontline workers around the globe, and we have committed more than $25 million for COVID-19 response in our communities. I must say that I've been so impressed and inspired by how our NIKE teammates around the world have come together and responded to this crisis. They have moved with speed and empathy, and have demonstrated creativity, courage and true resilience. I could not be more proud of everyone on the NIKE team.
As we look back on this quarter, it demonstrated once again that NIKE's competitive advantage is driven by our team and by our brand's ability to connect with consumers, and this is fueled by our strategy, the consumer direct offense. And it's why I continue to believe no one is better positioned than Nike to navigate the current environment.
Now Matt will go deeper on Q4 in a minute, so I'll just hit on 5 quick observations from the quarter. First, the power of NIKE's brand continues. Leading with our values is drawing us closer to consumers. We use our ecosystem of NIKE activity and commerce apps to directly engage with consumers in their homes as they focus on health and wellness. During this difficult time, Nike has inspired and offered hope. And as a result, worldwide affinity for our brand deepened during COVID-19 and with our You Can't Stop Us campaign receiving more than 2 billion impressions to date. Across all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand.
Second, Greater China has returned to currency-neutral growth. Over the quarter, we strengthened our consumer connections and translated them into meaningful relationships. For example, in March and April, China's monthly active users on the Nike Training app increased over 350% since the beginning of the calendar year. This direct engagement with consumers allowed our business in China to return to growth in Q4.
Third, we're seeing a true step function change in our digital transformation. As you know, this has been an area of investment over the past few years as we built our digital advantage that COVID-19 has accelerated the pace. In Q4, NIKE Digital grew 79%, and we surpassed $1 billion in annual digital revenue in both Greater China and EMEA for the first time. We have seen the strong digital momentum continued throughout the quarter and into early June, even as stores have begun to reopen.
Looking at our app ecosystem in Q4, a couple of stats jump out as we see an extraordinary leap in digital demand and engagement. Workouts on the Nike Training Club app more than tripled, peaking in April at nearly 5 million workouts per week during the month. Since February, the NIKE commerce app has been downloaded more than 8 million times, an increase that's triple last year's level proving the power of our investment in digital. And in fiscal year '20, SNKRS reached an impressive milestone, reaching $1 billion in global demand for the first time.
Fourth observation on the quarter, the Jordan Brand resonated deeply in Q4 with the airing of ESPN's The Last Dance Documentary. The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell-through of the AJ 5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan Brand all over the world. In fact, the Jordan brand in Greater China grew more than 50% in fiscal year '20, approaching $1 billion in annual revenue. And women's has played a key role in Jordan's growth. And we see significant opportunity for Jordan to achieve even greater scale as we create more products for women, expand lifestyle offerings and grow the business internationally. And even during a pandemic, Jordan drove some of the quarter's biggest launches, including the AJ 1 and AJ 13, a reminder of the continued strength of our consumer demand.
Fifth and finally, innovation continues to be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. We continuously bring fresh new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. In Q4, we saw strong demand for the Pegasus 37, particularly with women and for the Air Max 2019, a new sportswear silhouette that reimagines the future of Air. We also launched Space Hippie in our international geographies during June, with early success offering even more proof of global consumer appetite for sustainable product. And our unmatched investment in product innovation, even during a pandemic, will be proven with our most sustainable product ever, the VaporMax 2020 launching in July.
As I said earlier, Nike is in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger due to our consumer direct offense. The global pandemic has made clear that consumer behavior is changing rapidly, providing the opportunity for us to accelerate the pace of our transformation. Over the past few years, we have shifted from a legacy wholesale distribution model to investment in a model that gives our consumers a more premium shopping experience. And this is a change that has catalyzed our digital growth as part of our true consumer direct offense, and COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound.
And so as we look to the future, here is what is not going to change: our purpose will continue to guide us; the power of sports will always be at our center; and product innovation will continue to drive distinction for our brand. With these strengths in mind, we plan to accelerate our focus and investment on the key areas to put an even sharper point on our highest growth opportunities. So today, we're announcing a new digitally empowered phase of our consumer direct strategy, the consumer direct acceleration. We aren't settling for our current leadership position with consumers or in digital, we're pursuing even further separation. We're transforming NIKE faster to define the marketplace of the future. Now is the time to act.
Let me walk you through 3 areas of strategic acceleration: the marketplace of the future, our new consumer construct and our end-to-end technology foundation. First, we will create a marketplace of the future, one more closely aligned with what consumers want and need. Digital has redefined the industry over the past several years, and NIKE has led that change. You'll recall that in fiscal year '18, we set a goal to reach 30% digital penetration, both owned and partnered, by fiscal year '23. We will reach that goal more than 2 years ahead of plan this coming year. And looking ahead, we now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration.
As we look at opportunities to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers, our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace to match. Consumers want modern, seamless experiences online to off-line, so we're accelerating our approach. Our one NIKE marketplace strategy leads with NIKE Digital in our own stores, and embraces a small number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium shopping experience. Connected data, inventory and membership will give consumers greater access to the best of NIKE with more speed and convenience than ever.
We've talked about membership as a growth driver and differentiator before, but now we'll align our business to make it central to everything we do. And as part of this strategy, we will also scale our investment in smaller-format, digitally enabled monobrand stores with integrated online to off-line capabilities. We believe this will be additive to what's in the market. These monobrand stores will accelerate the growth trajectory of NIKE's largest market share opportunity, like women's and apparel, driving long-term profitability.
Our second area of acceleration under consumer direct acceleration Nike will operate under a new simpler consumer construct. We know that our consumers don't see themselves as only runners or yoga practitioners. They don't think in terms of performance versus sportswear. Instead, we know how they shop across men's, women's and kids. And so we'll realign the company to reflect the simplified men's, women's and kids approach. Our category focus will be more specialized across this same construct. Importantly, this consumer construct will allow us to significantly simplify our organization and focus more of our resources on the capabilities and opportunities that will forge our future. In particular, we'll be reinvesting in our women's and kids businesses. These intentional organizational focuses will touch every area of our business including innovation, product creation, marketing, merchandising and distribution. Through this new consumer construct, we can serve performance sport with more specificity while also broadening the definition of sport. This approach allows us to better focus on the individual consumer and unlock new opportunities to more nimbly serve their exact needs.
And third and finally, we will invest in digital capabilities in our end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our transformation. Simply put, we will more aggressively leverage technology to make NIKE better. This single integrated technology strategy across our business will accelerate how we serve consumers. Specifically, we'll speed up and unifier investments across demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and more. This simplified approach will unlock more efficiency for the business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.
Consumer Direct acceleration is more than just the next phase of our strategy. It's the spark that will ignite and empower our entire company to serve consumers, our business and our teams better. As we shift our operating model to fuel this strategy, NIKE's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers amid a global shift towards health and wellness.
In the end, over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions, but our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. The strength of our brand, our deep connections to consumers and our unmatched product innovation give us an advantage to create and define our future, fueled by the Consumer Direct acceleration Nike will shape the marketplace and extend our brand leadership for years to come.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I mu",2521,"Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I must recognize and thank our incredible team around the world. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges, embracing new ways of working, and decisively taking actions to serve our consumers in the face of unprecedented conditions. I could not be prouder to be a part of this team.
This quarter was certainly like no other in NIKE's history. As John mentioned, to protect the safety of our employees and to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 90% of our own stores, outside of Greater China and South Korea, were closed from operation for roughly 8 weeks in the quarter. Similarly, our wholesale partners largely followed this same pattern, and the sale of product through physical retail channels came to a halt. Digital quickly became the primary channel that we could engage with and serve consumer demand and NIKE was well positioned to respond. We accelerated growth of our digital business to 79% on a currency-neutral basis and drove nearly triple-digit acceleration in member digital demand. All told, NIKE Digital represented nearly 30% of our total business in the fourth quarter and reached $5.5 billion for the full year.
The net result of these 2 marketplace dynamics was that NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% on a reported basis. And yet, even in the midst of this global pandemic, we saw the power and distinction of the NIKE Brand translate into growing business momentum throughout the quarter, continuing into June.
Greater China returned to growth in Q4, and NIKE Digital also accelerated growth each month in the quarter, including triple-digit growth globally in May, even as physical retail reopened. These trends have sustained through the first 3 weeks of June, and in some markets, digital growth has accelerated even further. We believe this digital acceleration is more indicative of a strategic shift towards a new future marketplace rather than being a reflection of temporary challenges to the mostly physical marketplace of the past.
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year '21, 3 key themes stand out from a financial and operational perspective: NIKE's supply and demand management, NIKE's financial strength and NIKE's digital acceleration. Let me take a few minutes to unpack each of these.
First, at the end of Q4, inventory increased 31% versus prior year. In mid-March, we immediately went into action to rebuild our plans to recalibrate marketplace supply and demand around the world. As we have said before, supply and demand management is critical to sustaining a healthy premium brand. And over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our capabilities to manage through situations like this. Let me share a few specifics regarding what we have already done.
First, we modified our near-term inventory buying plans and proactively canceled pre COVID-19 factory purchase orders for the fall and holiday seasons by roughly 30% on a unit basis. And while this had a negative impact on gross margins in Q4, it was the right decision to tighten future inventory movement through our supply chain, and utilize the inventory we have on hand.
Second, we implemented a plan for a seasonless flow of inventory by shifting product offer dates so we can use relevant summer and fall product to meet near-term demand. We also edited product lines by up to 15% to improve SKU productivity.
Third, we quickly shifted available inventory to digital, and we increased digital fulfillment capacity by more than 3x in North America and EMEA. 
And finally, we've invested in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate the liquidation of excess inventory, while we protect the long-term health of our product franchises including increasing the volume of liquidation through our factory store fleet.
In Greater China, this playbook has worked, and we expect our business will return to normalized marketplace health metrics by the end of June. In fact, we are already seeing inventory levels globally improve as well. And with our deliberate actions, we are confident that NIKE inventory will be rightsized and in a normal position in Q2.
This leads me to the second theme, NIKE's financial strength enables us to stay focused on the long term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation. In an environment where most companies are solely focused on survival, NIKE's financial strength, scale and adaptability allows us to make appropriate near-term decisions while investing to fuel long-term growth.
We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity, including nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term investments. All supported by a strong investment-grade credit rating and a high-return on invested capital. We continue to operate from a position of strength, and I would not trade our position with anyone.
Our current focus is to reduce discretionary spending, while we invest in the digital capabilities necessary to further our competitive advantage in the marketplace. This includes improving the user experience on our digital platforms through enhanced digital commerce analytics; marketing technology for better consumer targeting and segmentation; online to off-line marketplace capabilities; and enhanced inventory pricing and supply management tools. We will continue to increase the scale and efficiency of our digital fulfillment capabilities. In Q4, we already pivoted our new Adapt distribution facility in North America to fully support digital demand. And we plan to open a new regional service center on the West Coast before the holiday season to forward-deploy digital inventory, leveraging advanced analytics and demand-sensing capabilities from our acquisition of Celect. Simply put, we have operating principles in place to prudently manage costs in the short term, while we scale investment in key capabilities underpinning our digital transformation. We will continue to do this while managing SG&A tightly in the first half of fiscal year '21.
And last, a more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. The underlying value proposition of NIKE's Consumer Direct Offense is that the consumer adoption of digital across all aspects of life now provides NIKE with an opportunity to create deeper, more direct consumer relationships at scale, without disintermediation. As we've said before, the transformation to a more digital and direct business is financially accretive to NIKE. Our business results over the last 7 quarters pre COVID-19 proved this point. As compared to our long-term financial model, NIKE has driven higher constant dollar revenue growth and roughly double the annual gross margin expansion on an operational basis, excluding the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds and tariffs. The current economics of this transformational shift illustrates my point. On average, a sale of an incremental unit via digital generates double the revenue versus a sale to wholesale, with a higher gross margin, translating into 2x the operating income dollars. And so to reiterate what John said in why this is so important, we now see that our owned and partner digital could grow to 50% of our total business in the foreseeable future, plus our measured investment in mono-brand stores will further catalyze digital growth. And create new distribution for our largest growth and market share opportunities in women's and apparel. We are calling this next phase of the Consumer Direct Offense an acceleration for a reason because it will drive greater growth, it will scale NIKE's direct consumer connections in our most profitable channels, driving higher consumer lifetime value and it will enable us to reposition our resources to accelerate our transformation to a digital-first company.
Now let's turn to the details of our fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38%, down 36% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting the impact of NIKE-owned store closures and lower wholesale shipments, partially offset by growth in NIKE Digital. Gross margin decreased 820 basis points in Q4 as higher full priced average selling prices despite increased wholesale discounts, were more than offset by higher product costs, including factory cancellation charges and increased inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the adverse rate impact of supply chain fixed costs on lower wholesale shipments due to COVID-19 dynamics.
SG&A declined 6% in Q4. The we reduced costs through clear enterprise-wide cost management principles, including reduction of marketing spending due to the cancellation of live sporting events and retail store closures. It's important to note that the decline in SG&A in the quarter included a roughly $180 million charge related to bad debt reserves. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.7% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year due to the mix of earnings taxed in the U.S. and favorability attributable to the use of foreign tax credits. Fourth quarter diluted net loss per share was $0.51 reflecting lower revenue and gross margin related to COVID-19, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. And full year diluted EPS was $1.60, which includes a onetime noncash charge associated with the anticipated strategic distributor partnership transition in South America which reduced EPS by $0.25.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Last quarter, we discussed how each of our markets would progress from a business perspective as they emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak. First, a recovery period, including the ramp-up of store reopenings; second, a period of normalization of supply and demand; and third, a period in which we returned to growth.
In Q4, Greater China and South Korea returned to growth. North America, EMEA and the remainder of APLA are still in the recovery period as stores began to reopen throughout May and early June. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 46% on a currency-neutral basis. However, NIKE Digital grew 80%, and the Nike App grew triple digits and now represents 30% of our North America digital business. Women's full price apparel grew 200% and was powered by strong new member growth, with women representing over half of new member acquisition in the quarter.
As retail began to reopen in mid-May, we saw strong double-digit growth in retail sales for our brand across the total North America marketplace. These trends have continued into early June, including NIKE Digital growing triple digits. Physical retail traffic remains below prior year, and is being offset by higher rates of conversion due to promotional activity as well as significant shifts to owned and partner digital. And as of today, approximately 85% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 44% on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew nearly 100% with continued brand momentum and significant new member acquisition and engagement across the Nike Training Club and the Nike Running Club apps, with active new member growth of over 200% and more than 18 million workouts logged in the quarter. And NIKE gained market share across both footwear and apparel becoming the #1 apparel brand during Q4 in key markets for the first time. As retail began to reopen in May, we saw slight growth in total retail sales versus the prior year across the marketplace, with better performance in Germany, France and the U.K., offset by slower recovery in Spain and Italy. Retail sales have now accelerated in June, including triple-digit NIKE Digital growth. Traffic levels, conversion trends and consumer shifts towards digital are similar to what we are seeing in North America. And as of today, approximately 90% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
With that, let's turn to Greater China, where we returned to growth of 1% on a currency-neutral basis and the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Growth improved each month of the quarter including strong double-digit growth in May on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew 53% outpacing the industry. And the Nike App, which launched in Q3, is already resonating with consumers with nearly 11 million downloads driving over 10% of total digital demand in the fourth quarter. As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores are open. In June, we have seen a return to positive comparable store sales in NIKE-owned stores, with higher conversion and higher units per transaction more than offsetting lower traffic. NIKE Digital growth has accelerated to triple digits.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q4 revenue declined 39% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw varied COVID-19 impact across countries in the region, with South Korea emerging the fastest, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. And digital growth was nearly 80%, led by strength in Japan, Korea and Brazil, with women's growing 2x the rate of men's on NIKE Digital. As of today, approximately 65% of NIKE-owned stores are open with a higher percentage in South Korea, Japan and Australia, while stores across Latin America remain largely closed due to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Fiscal year '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty as economies rebound from the effects of COVID-19 and seek to contain further outbreaks of the disease. We will be agile and resilient because we understand that each market recovery will not be linear. We remain focused on what we can control so that NIKE can manage risk and aggressively attack opportunities created in this environment.
Given the uncertainty that still remains, we will not be providing specific guidance. Today, however, I will share the approach we are taking to fiscal year '21 planning. In general, we expect to see sequential quarterly improvement in our financial results as retail reopens and each market normalizes supply and demand.
We expect revenue in the first half of the year to be below prior year levels, but less of a decline than experienced in Q4 as we continue to reopen stores and fuel our digital business. We expect revenue in the second half to be up significantly versus the prior year, with a healthy marketplace and normalizing full price sell-through across our channels. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be flat to up versus prior year. And of course, we will have greater clarity on our full year outlook 90 days from now.
Gross margin will continue in the short term to be a function of our supply and demand management actions as we prioritize the return to normalized inventory levels in Q2. As I said earlier, we have tightened our buys in the first half, and are focused on moving through the inventory we have as profitably as we can. We expect SG&A to decline versus the prior year.
The financial and operating principles that will carry us through these unprecedented times are the same ones that have guided us over the decades. And our brand momentum and deep consumer connections, our differentiated product and continuous flow of innovation, our digital advantage and our operational capabilities have never been stronger. In addition, consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, leaving NIKE's market opportunity larger than ever. And though we can't predict short-term trends due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, interestingly enough, we can now see our brand's long-term future even more clearly.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

And here's -- we look at everything to the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know, are becoming accustomed to getting what they want, when they want it, how they want it, right? And this pandemic has really demonstrated the shift toward digital being at the center of everything they do, but they want modern and seamless experiences. They don't necessarily just want to buy it digitally and have it shipped from home. You're seeing during the pandemic, and we believe it will continue, they want to buy it on their digital device and go pick it up in the store. Or with soft goods like apparel, they may want to reserve it online and try it on in the store. They may want to be in a store and buy something that's not in the store because of inventory and the associate uses a digital device to buy it and get shipped home. And so consumers increasingly want a consistent, seamless physical and digital experience. And so that's what we're committed to providing. And we're committed to providing those through, first and foremost, our own digital capabilities as well as our own digital stores, both factory -- or I'm sorry, our own digital stores, factory and direct. A very important piece of this is our strategic partners, our strategic wholesale partners. We envision having fewer of them but focusing on those that will share our vision of providing a seamless experience, a consistency in its experience with physical points of presence.
And then we think there's an incremental opportunity in the market and a need to provide a mono-brand experience, particularly around women's and apparel. We have actually seen this first hand in China. As you know, in China, with a relatively modest investment, there are mono-brand stores that dramatically upscale how we serve consumers. I've had a chance to see this firsthand during my first weeks at NIKE in China, which I long for to get back out on the road, get back out in the market, get back out with consumers. That's coming again, I know. But I got to see firsthand the power of those mono-brand stores. And so we'll be opening somewhere between 150, 200 new stores. There'll be small footprint, digitally-enabled, mono-brand stores, in North America and EMEA. It's -- we've been testing this format with NIKE Live and have a great understanding of how to best deliver this experience. And so we will proceed ahead this year with more test and learn examples of it and scale it through the next couple of years. And again, to be clear, we believe this is incremental to what's in the market today. It's complementary to what we are already doing and our partners are doing. And at the end of the day, we believe that NIKE-owned physical and digital, working hand-in-hand with our key partners, online and off-line, we can create one NIKE marketplace that meets the demand of consumers, now and in the future."

And as we continue to test the concept, we've been testing the assortment, we've been testing member engagement. We're seeing that members engage more frequently. It's serving to help us retain members. And so as John mentioned, this is why we see this as being a catalyst to digital growth, having local stores that members can engage with."

And they were working, frankly, when we came into the pandemic. And the pandemic, in many ways, was a stress test for them, and it really proved that our current strategy is working. So what we're talking about here is how do we take what might have taken us 3 to 5 years to make happen and make it happen in 2. And we think there's some pretty fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that give us this opportunity to accelerate our progress. One shift is digital, right? As I said a minute ago, digital is now fundamental and central to everything consumers do, and we are the clear leader in digital. We'll double down on that. The second I just talked about was the marketplace of the future, right, where we believe we can drive toward 1 NIKE marketplace with our own capabilities and those of our partners. But third, and directly to your question, is aligning our organization against, a, more simple construct of men's, women's and kids. But also one that helps us unlock what we think are great growth opportunities, right, women's, apparel, kids, and frankly, the emerging health and wellness opportunity. So this is not -- to be crystal clear, not abandoning the Consumer Direct Offense. This is accelerating it and refining it so that we're more directly connected to the biggest opportunities. Like women's, I'll just -- a great example of women's. We have less than 10% of the women's apparel market in the U.S. Women's grew this quarter, 2x the rate of men. And this will allow us to align our organization and focus our resources more directly on that opportunity as well as on others. And so we view it as an acceleration, and I think it will result in more directly connecting and building deep consumer relationships, which will result in higher growth, market share. And as Matt said in his remarks, we believe also this is also healthy for profitability."

And if you think about it, in simple terms, membership is a big word, but in my mind, it breaks down 3 simple things. Do we have a one-on-one relationship, an identified one-on-one relationship with the consumer? Can we increase our level of engagement with that consumer in value-added ways? And then does that increase engagement lead to greater retention and share of wallet of their purchases. And in terms of acquiring new members in the quarter, we had a phenomenal quarter. 25 million new members registered, that's up over 100%. Half of those came from our activity apps. And half the new members were women, which is a very encouraging sign. And then that -- those new members and our existing members were highly engaged, particularly around Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, our SNKRS App, the stats are just -- I think I listed a few of my remarks, and Matt did. But NTC weekly active users, which is a really important metric  because someone may only buy footwear and apparel a few times a year, but engaging with us each week, maybe even each day, brings NIKE into their lives. And so we grew weekly active users triple digits in the quarter. 25 million workouts with women alone in Q4, and which is -- and so we think the activity levels and the engagement's growing. And then it's really clear that increased engagement leads to increased purchases. And so the NIKE commerce app saw triple-digit growth in both downloads and monthly active buyers as well the SNKRS App over $1 billion in first-time use. And so directly connecting with consumers, engaging them with our powerful portfolio of activity apps and then translating that into the kind of both digital and online and off-line relationships where they purchase more is kind of core to the strategy, the one NIKE marketplace, if you will, is designed to address that direct need."

And we believe that this will be an enabler for us to sustain that momentum longer term. In the near term -- or in any given period, obviously, we deal with foreign currency, we deal with anomalies that can have an impact on an interim period. But we're very confident in and how this strategy will enable us to sustain that growth long term. What I would tell you, because you asked the question about investment, we have been -- this quarter, in particular, was indicative of an opportunity for us where we managed SG&A very tightly, but we actually accelerated investment the way we needed to, to enable our employees to work from home, to enable digital demand, to do the things that we needed to do in order to be able to accommodate the environment in which we're operating. And as we look to the future, while we will accelerate investment against the areas that I referenced, we also see equal opportunity for us to shift resources that sit in our P&L in legacy forms, which we can redeploy again the future. And so that's going to be our focus as we look towards the future. We will be investing, but we're going to try to accommodate it within the confines of our existing financial model."

As you know, Nike has always tried to carefully manage supply and demand. And as a premium brand, we maintain our premium nature because we try to optimize a full price marketplace across our channels season after season after season. And so when the pandemic hit, it became clear that there was going to be excess inventory for a period of time. And we pulled many of the levers that we have at our disposal in order to be aggressive in addressing this issue. And in particular, we said our first and primary principle was to get inventory clean in the marketplace as fast as we possibly can. And so we now feel confident based upon the actions that we've taken, that we will have inventory rightsized and clean by Q2 -- or in Q2. And in China, as I referenced, given they faced the pandemic a little bit earlier, they're going to clear and come out of the situation from an inventory perspective by the end of June. And so we feel very good about the actions that we've taken. To your point, we are -- the marketplace is more promotional. We have shifted more units of liquidation through our factory store fleet because that's a brand right way for us to liquidate our inventory at a higher profitability level. But we are also seeing some discounting that's happening across the marketplace. But our discounting is less than what we're seeing across the broader marketplace. And our strong brand and our consumer connection is causing us to liquidate and move through inventory faster than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace. And so through the first 3 weeks of June, as I referenced, we feel like we're on track against this plan -- or we are on track against this plan. And are confident that we're going to be positioned for the consumer and for the market in the second half of the year."

So I'm incredibly proud of our teams that work in our global operation and logistics because they delivered no small feat in the quarter, increasing the amount of volume that we could ship by 3x in North America and EMEA, without much of an increase in cost on a per unit basis. And the reason why they could do that is because our current distribution capabilities are omnichannel, which means we can ship to wholesale customers, our factory stores and to digital. And that enabled us to be agile in the moment to increase our demand -- our digital demand fulfillment, sorry. As we look forward, I mentioned that we're going to be investing in a new facility on the West Coast of the U.S. in order to be able to fulfill demand through holiday. And we expect that we will continue to invest in regional service centers in order to be able to fulfill demand closer to the consumer. But we're also enabling buy online -- we've also enabled buy online pickup in-store and ship from store from our stores, which will also be a way that we fulfill demand closer to the consumer. So I guess a long way of saying that we feel confident that we can continue to meet this digital demand. And our team continues to be able to expand capacity without it compromising our cost per unit. In fact, they continue to do what they can to mitigate cost per unit, and we believe it's a long-term opportunity for us as well."

The first thing I would say is that year-to-date through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And that was on the back of a really strong product portfolio, innovation and then ultimately, our digital business. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was impacted by COVID-19 and the decision that we took to prioritize cleaning and rightsizing our inventory by -- into Q2. And so the plans that we aggressively put in place to rebalance supply and demand did have an impact on our margins in Q4. But let me break down the [ 8 24 ] with you maybe a little bit more. About 500 basis points of the impact was related to factory PO cancels inventory obsolescence as we were making decisions about the value of our inventory and our plans to liquidate it, and then the negative rate impact due to lower wholesale shipments on our supply chain costs. What that last point really means is that as our press release said, our wholesale shipments were down 50%. But because our costs are mostly fixed, you see a rate -- a negative rate impact as a result of that. And so as wholesale shipments start to pick up, you'll see less of an impact as you look towards the future. And then we also had 70 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter.
As we look ahead to next year, we do expect the market to remain promotional in the first half. And in Q4, we had about 250 basis points impact from like promotional activity across our own stores and our partners as we were investing to liquidate inventory across the marketplace. As we look to the first half of next year, we expect that the marketplace will continue to be promotional as we and our partners are moving through this inventory to achieve our goal. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see sequential improvement relative to what we delivered in Q4 as we move quarter-by-quarter through the first half.
I think you also asked about bad debt. So bad debt sits in SG&A, it doesn't sit in margin. And it was $180 million in the quarter. And I think that's really more reflective of the wholesale marketplace. And our risk assessment of some of our wholesale customers, and the impact that this pandemic has had on their ability to pay NIKE for receivables that were owed. And so if you connect the dots to what John said in terms of our strategic acceleration, we do believe that there's going to be consolidation and dislocation in wholesale distribution in North America and in EMEA. And that's why we're taking a measured approach to growth in those geos as we look forward to next year."

I also want to congratulate Matt on becoming our CFO and express how deeply confident I am in NIKE's financial management under Matt's leadership.
Before I get into our Q4 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the environment in the U.S. right now. Over the past month, we've seen racial tragedies expose systemic prejudice and injustice in America. And Nike has a long history of standing up against inequality driven by our values and rooted in the power of sport. Today, we are uniting behind our black athletes, teammates and community as NIKE continues to lead with purpose. And we're taking action to help create lasting change to address systemic racism in our society, including a combined $140 million commitment from NIKE, Converse, the Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan. And while we continue to lead externally, we also strive to be even better internally to meet the high bar we set for ourselves to be a truly diverse and inclusive company.
We're also continuing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the lives of so many across the globe. And throughout all of this, we have led with our values. We have executed with empathy and decisiveness. We prioritized the health and safety of our teammates by closing stores, offices and other facilities. We committed to provide pay continuity for all of our teammates even while our facilities remain closed or had altered schedules, and we have maintained this important investment over the past 12 weeks. Our innovation teams designed and delivered personal protective equipment to health systems across the country. We donated footwear and apparel to help frontline workers around the globe, and we've committed more than $25 million for COVID-19 response in our communities.
I must say that I've been so impressed and inspired by how our NIKE teammates around the world have come together and responded to this crisis. They have moved with speed and empathy and have demonstrated creativity, courage and true resilience. I could not be more proud of everyone on the NIKE team.
As we look back on this quarter, it demonstrated once again that NIKE's competitive advantage is driven by our team and by our brand's ability to connect with consumers. And this is fueled by our strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. And it's why I continue to believe no one is better positioned than Nike to navigate the current environment.
Now Matt will go deeper on Q4 in a minute, so I'll just hit on 5 quick observations from the quarter. First, the power of NIKE's brand continues. Leading with our values is drawing us closer to consumers. We use our ecosystem of NIKE activity and commerce apps to directly engage with consumers in their homes as they focus on health and wellness. During this difficult time, Nike has inspired and offered hope. And as a result, worldwide affinity for our brand deepened during COVID-19, with our You Can't Stop Us campaign receiving more than 2 billion impressions to date. Across all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand.
Second, Greater China has returned to currency-neutral growth. Over the quarter, we strengthened our consumer connections and translated them into meaningful relationships. For example, in March and April, China's monthly active users on the Nike Training app increased over 350% since the beginning of the calendar year. This direct engagement with consumers allowed our business in China to return to growth in Q4.
Third, we're seeing a true step function change in our digital transformation. As you know, this has been an area of investment over the past few years as we built our digital advantage, but COVID-19 has accelerated the pace. In Q4, NIKE Digital grew 79%, and we surpassed $1 billion in annual digital revenue in both Greater China and EMEA for the first time. We've seen the strong digital momentum continued throughout the quarter and into early June even as stores have begun to reopen.
Looking at our app ecosystem in Q4, a couple of stats jump out as we see an extraordinary leap in digital demand and engagement. Workouts on the Nike Training Club app more than tripled, peaking in April at nearly 5 million workouts per week during the month. Since February, the NIKE commerce app has been downloaded more than 8 million times, an increase that's triple last year's level, proving the power of our investment in digital. And in fiscal year '20, SNKRS reached an impressive milestone, reaching $1 billion in global demand for the first time.
Fourth observation on the quarter, the Jordan Brand resonated deeply in Q4 with the airing of ESPN's The Last Dance documentary. The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell-through of the AJ5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan Brand all over the world. In fact, the Jordan Brand in Greater China grew more than 50% in fiscal year '20, approaching $1 billion in annual revenue.
And Women's has played a key role in Jordan's growth. And we see significant opportunity for Jordan to achieve even greater scale as we create more products for women, expand lifestyle offerings and grow the business internationally. And even during a pandemic, Jordan drove some of the quarter's biggest launches, including the AJ1 and AJ13, a reminder of the continued strength of our consumer demand.
Fifth, and finally, innovation continues to be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. We continuously bring fresh new product to market supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. In Q4, we saw strong demand for the Pegasus 37, particularly with women, and for the Air Max 2019, a new sportswear silhouette that reimagines the future of Air. We also launched Space Hippie in our international geographies during June, with early success offering even more proof of global consumer appetite for sustainable product. And our unmatched investment in product innovation, even during a pandemic, will be proven with our most sustainable product ever, the VaporMax 2020 launching in July.
As I said earlier, Nike is in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger due to our Consumer Direct Offense. The global pandemic has made it clear that consumer behavior is changing rapidly, providing the opportunity for us to accelerate the pace of our transformation. Over the past few years, we have shifted from a legacy wholesale distribution model to investment in a model that gives our consumers a more premium shopping experience. And this is a change that has catalyzed our digital growth as part of our true Consumer Direct Offense, and COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound.
And so as we look to the future, here's what is not going to change: our purpose will continue to guide us, the power of sports will always be at our center and product innovation will continue to drive distinction for our brand. With these strengths in mind, we plan to accelerate our focus and investment on the key areas to put an even sharper point on our highest growth opportunities.
So today, we're announcing a new digitally empowered phase of our consumer direct strategy, the Consumer Direct Acceleration. We aren't settling for our current leadership position with consumers or in digital, we're pursuing even further separation. We're transforming NIKE faster to define the marketplace of the future. Now is the time to act.
Let me walk you through 3 areas of strategic acceleration: the marketplace of the future, our new consumer construct and our end-to-end technology foundation. First, we will create a marketplace of the future, one more closely aligned with what consumers want and need. Digital has redefined the industry over the past several years, and NIKE has led that change. You'll recall that in fiscal year '18, we set a goal to reach 30% digital penetration, both owned and partnered, by fiscal year '23. We will reach that goal more than 2 years ahead of plan this coming year. And looking ahead, we now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration.
As we look at opportunities to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers, our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace to match. Consumers want modern, seamless experiences online to off-line, so we're accelerating our approach. Our one NIKE marketplace strategy leads with NIKE Digital in our own stores and embraces a small number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium shopping experience. Connected data, inventory and membership will give consumers greater access to the best of NIKE with more speed and convenience than ever.
We've talked about membership as a growth driver and differentiator before, but now we'll align our business to make it central to everything we do. And as part of this strategy, we will also scale our investment in smaller-format, digitally enabled monobrand stores with integrated online to off-line capabilities. We believe this will be additive to what's in the market. These monobrand stores will accelerate the growth trajectory of NIKE's largest market share opportunity, like women's and apparel, driving long-term profitability.
Our second area of acceleration under Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will operate under a new, simpler consumer construct. We know that our consumers don't see themselves as only runners or yoga practitioners. They don't think in terms of performance versus sportswear. Instead, we know how they shop across men's, women's and kids. And so we'll realign the company to reflect the simplified men's, women's and kids approach. Our category focus will be more specialized across this consumer construct. Importantly, this consumer construct will allow us to significantly simplify our organization and focus more of our resources on the capabilities and opportunities that will forge our future. In particular, we'll be reinvesting in our women's and kids businesses. These intentional organizational focuses will touch every area of our business, including innovation, product creation, marketing, merchandising and distribution. Through this new consumer construct, we can serve performance sport with more specificity while also broadening the definition of sport. This approach allows us to better focus on the individual consumer and unlock new opportunities to more nimbly serve their exact needs.
And third, and finally, we will invest in digital capabilities in our end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our transformation. Simply put, we will more aggressively leverage technology to make NIKE better. This single integrated technology strategy across our business will accelerate how we serve consumers. Specifically, we'll speed up and unify our investments across demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and more. This simplified approach will unlock more efficiency for the business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.
Consumer Direct Acceleration is more than just the next phase of our strategy. It's the spark that will ignite and empower our entire company to serve consumers, our business and our teams better. As we shift our operating model to fuel this strategy, NIKE's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers amid a global shift towards health and wellness.
In the end, over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions, but our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. The strength of our brand, our deep connections to consumers and our unmatched product innovation give us an advantage to create and define our future. Fueled by the Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will shape the marketplace and extend our brand leadership for years to come.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations.Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I m",2517,"Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations.
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I must recognize and thank our incredible team around the world. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges, embracing new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our consumers in the face of unprecedented conditions. I could not be prouder to be a part of this team.
This quarter was certainly like no other in NIKE's history. As John mentioned, to protect the safety of our employees and to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 90% of our own stores, outside of Greater China and South Korea, were closed from operation for roughly 8 weeks in the quarter. Similarly, our wholesale partners largely followed this same pattern, and the sale of product through physical retail channels came to a halt.
Digital quickly became the primary channel that we could engage with and serve consumer demand, and NIKE was well positioned to respond. We accelerated growth of our digital business to 79% on a currency-neutral basis and drove nearly triple-digit acceleration in member digital demand. All told, NIKE Digital represented nearly 30% of our total business in the fourth quarter and reached $5.5 billion for the full year.
The net result of these 2 marketplace dynamics was that NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% on a reported basis. And yet, even in the midst of this global pandemic, we saw the power and distinction of the NIKE Brand translate into growing business momentum throughout the quarter, continuing into June.
Greater China returned to growth in Q4. And Nike Digital also accelerated growth each month in the quarter, including triple-digit growth globally in May even as physical retail reopened. These trends have sustained through the first 3 weeks of June, and in some markets, digital growth has accelerated even further. We believe this digital acceleration is more indicative of a strategic shift towards a new future marketplace rather than being a reflection of temporary challenges to the mostly physical marketplace of the past.
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year '21, 3 key themes stand out from a financial and operational perspective: NIKE's supply and demand management, NIKE's financial strength and NIKE's digital acceleration. Let me take a few minutes to unpack each of these.
First, at the end of Q4, inventory increased 31% versus prior year. In mid-March, we immediately went into action to rebuild our plans to recalibrate marketplace supply and demand around the world. As we have said before, supply and demand management is critical to sustaining a healthy premium brand. And over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our capabilities to manage through situations like this. Let me share a few specifics regarding what we have already done.
First, we modified our near-term inventory buying plans and proactively canceled pre-COVID-19 factory purchase orders for the fall and holiday seasons by roughly 30% on a unit basis. And while this had a negative impact on gross margins in Q4, it was the right decision to tighten future inventory movement through our supply chain and utilize the inventory we have on hand.
Second, we implemented a plan for a seasonless flow of inventory by shifting product offer dates so we can use relevant summer and fall product to meet near-term demand. We also edited product lines by up to 15% to improve SKU productivity.
Third, we quickly shifted available inventory to digital, and we increased digital fulfillment capacity by more than 3x in North America and EMEA.
And finally, we've invested in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate the liquidation of excess inventory while we protect the long-term health of our product franchises, including increasing the volume of liquidation through our factory store fleet.
In Greater China, this playbook has worked, and we expect our business will return to normalized marketplace health metrics by the end of June. In fact, we are already seeing inventory levels globally improve as well. And with our deliberate actions, we are confident that NIKE inventory will be rightsized and in a normal position in Q2.
This leads me to the second theme. NIKE's financial strength enables us to stay focused on the long term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation. In an environment where most companies are solely focused on survival, NIKE's financial strength, scale and adaptability allows us to make appropriate near-term decisions while investing to fuel long-term growth. We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity, including nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term investments, all supported by a strong investment-grade credit rating and a high return on invested capital. We continue to operate from a position of strength, and I would not trade our position with anyone.
Our current focus is to reduce discretionary spending while we invest in the digital capabilities necessary to further our competitive advantage in the marketplace. This includes improving the user experience on our digital platforms through enhanced digital commerce analytics, marketing technology for better consumer targeting and segmentation, online to off-line marketplace capabilities and enhanced inventory pricing and supply management tools. We will continue to increase the scale and efficiency of our digital fulfillment capabilities. In Q4, we already pivoted our new Adapt distribution facility in North America to fully support digital demand. And we plan to open a new regional service center on the West Coast before the holiday season to forward-deploy digital inventory, leveraging advanced analytics and demand-sensing capabilities from our acquisition of Celect.
Simply put, we have operating principles in place to prudently manage costs in the short term while we scale investment in key capabilities underpinning our digital transformation. We will continue to do this while managing SG&A tightly in the first half of fiscal year '21.
And last, a more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. The underlying value proposition of Nike's Consumer Direct Offense is that the consumer adoption of digital across all aspects of life now provides NIKE with an opportunity to create deeper, more direct consumer relationships at scale without disintermediation. As we've said before, the transformation to a more digital and direct business is financially accretive to NIKE. Our business results over the last 7 quarters pre-COVID-19 proved this point. As compared to our long-term financial model, NIKE has driven higher constant dollar revenue growth and roughly double the annual gross margin expansion on an operational basis, excluding the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds and tariffs.
The current economics of this transformational shift illustrates my point. On average, a sale of an incremental unit via digital generates double the revenue versus a sale to wholesale, with a higher gross margin translating into 2x the operating income dollars. And so to reiterate what John said in why this is so important, we now see that our owned and partner digital could grow to 50% of our total business in the foreseeable future, plus our measured investment in monobrand stores will further catalyze digital growth and create new distribution for our largest growth and market share opportunities in women's and apparel. We are calling this next phase of the Consumer Direct Offense an acceleration for a reason because it will drive greater growth; it will scale NIKE's direct consumer connections in our most profitable channels, driving higher consumer lifetime value; and it will enable us to reposition our resources to accelerate our transformation to a digital-first company.
Now let's turn to the details of our fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38%, down 36% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting the impact of NIKE-owned store closures and lower wholesale shipments, partially offset by growth in NIKE Digital.
Gross margin decreased 820 basis points in Q4 as higher full-price average selling prices, despite increased wholesale discounts, were more than offset by higher product costs, including factory cancellation charges and increased inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the adverse rate impact of supply chain fixed costs on lower wholesale shipments due to COVID-19 dynamics.
SG&A declined 6% in Q4. We reduced costs through clear enterprise-wide cost management principles, including reduction of marketing spending due to the cancellation of live sporting events and retail store closures. It's important to note that the decline in SG&A in the quarter included a roughly $180 million charge related to bad debt reserves.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.7% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year due to the mix of earnings taxed in the U.S. and favorability attributable to the use of foreign tax credits.
Fourth quarter diluted net loss per share was $0.51, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin related to COVID-19, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. And full year diluted EPS was $1.60, which includes a onetime noncash charge associated with the anticipated strategic distributor partnership transition in South America which reduced EPS by $0.25.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Last quarter, we discussed how each of our markets would progress from a business perspective as they emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak: first, a recovery period, including the ramp-up of store reopenings; second, a period of normalization of supply and demand; and third, a period in which we return to growth.
In Q4, Greater China and South Korea returned to growth. North America, EMEA and the remainder of APLA are still in the recovery period as stores began to reopen throughout May and early June.
In North America, Q4 revenue declined 46% on a currency-neutral basis. However, NIKE Digital grew 80%, and the Nike App grew triple digits and now represents 30% of our North America digital business. Women's full-price apparel grew 200% and was powered by strong new member growth, with women representing over half of new member acquisition in the quarter.
As retail began to reopen in mid-May, we saw strong double-digit growth in retail sales for our brand across the total North America marketplace. These trends have continued into early June, including NIKE Digital growing triple digits. Physical retail traffic remains below prior year and is being offset by higher rates of conversion due to promotional activity as well as significant shifts to owned and partner digital. And as of today, approximately 85% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 44% on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew nearly 100% with continued brand momentum and significant new member acquisition and engagement across the Nike Training Club and the Nike Running Club apps with active new member growth of over 200% and more than 18 million workouts logged in the quarter. And NIKE gained market share across both footwear and apparel becoming the #1 apparel brand during Q4 in key markets for the first time.
As retail began to reopen in May, we saw slight growth in total retail sales versus the prior year across the marketplace with better performance in Germany, France and the U.K., offset by slower recovery in Spain and Italy. Retail sales have now accelerated in June, including triple-digit NIKE Digital growth. Traffic levels, conversion trends and consumer shifts towards digital are similar to what we are seeing in North America. And as of today, approximately 90% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
With that, let's turn to Greater China where we returned to growth of 1% on a currency-neutral basis and the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Growth improved each month of the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in May on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew 53%, outpacing the industry.  And the Nike App, which launched in Q3, is already resonating with consumers with nearly 11 million downloads driving over 10% of total digital demand in the fourth quarter. As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores are open. In June, we have seen a return to positive comparable store sales in NIKE-owned stores, with higher conversion and higher units per transaction more than offsetting lower traffic. NIKE Digital growth has accelerated to triple digits.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q4 revenue declined 39% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw varied COVID-19 impact across countries in the region with South Korea emerging the fastest, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. And digital growth was nearly 80% led by strength in Japan, Korea and Brazil, with women's growing 2x the rate of men's on NIKE Digital. As of today, approximately 65% of NIKE-owned stores are open with a higher percentage in South Korea, Japan and Australia, while stores across Latin America remain largely closed due to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Fiscal year '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty as economies rebound from the effects of COVID-19 and seek to contain further outbreaks of the disease. We will be agile and resilient because we understand that each market recovery will not be linear. We remain focused on what we can control so that NIKE can manage risk and aggressively attack opportunities created in this environment.
Given the uncertainty that still remains, we will not be providing specific guidance. Today, however, I will share the approach we are taking to fiscal year '21 planning. In general, we expect to see sequential quarterly improvement in our financial results as retail reopens and each market normalizes supply and demand.
We expect revenue in the first half of the year to be below prior year levels but less of a decline than experienced in Q4 as we continue to reopen stores and fuel our digital business. We expect revenue in the second half to be up significantly versus the prior year with a healthy marketplace and a normalizing full-price sell-through across our channels. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be flat to up versus prior year. And of course, we will have greater clarity on our full year outlook 90 days from now.
Gross margin will continue in the short term to be a function of our supply and demand management actions as we prioritize the return to normalized inventory levels in Q2. As I said earlier, we have tightened our buys in the first half and are focused on moving through the inventory we have as profitably as we can. We expect SG&A to decline versus the prior year.
The financial and operating principles that will carry us through these unprecedented times are the same ones that have guided us over the decades. And our brand momentum and deep consumer connections, our differentiated product and continuous flow of innovation, our digital advantage and our operational capabilities have never been stronger. In addition, consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, leaving NIKE's market opportunity larger than ever. And though we can't predict short-term trends due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, interestingly enough, we can now see our brand's long-term future even more clearly.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

291981,669560770,2026354,"NIKE, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jun 25, 2020",2020-06-25,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Alexander (sic) [ Alexandra ]. In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know,",529,"Sure, Alexander (sic) [ Alexandra ]. In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know, are becoming accustomed to getting what they want, when they want it, how they want it, right? And this pandemic has really demonstrated the shift toward digital being at the center of everything they do, but they want modern and seamless experiences. They don't necessarily just want to buy it digitally and have it shipped from home. You're seeing during the pandemic, and we believe it will continue, they want to buy it on their digital device and go pick it up in the store. Or with soft goods, like apparel, they may want to reserve it online and try it on in the store. They may want to be in a store and buy something that's not in the store because of inventory, and the associate uses a digital device to buy it and get shipped home.
And so consumers increasingly want a consistent, seamless physical and digital experience. And so that's what we're committed to providing. And we're committed to providing those through, first and foremost, our own digital capabilities as well as our own digital stores, both factory -- or I'm sorry, our own physical stores, factory and direct. A very important piece of this is our strategic partners, our strategic wholesale partners. We envision having fewer of them but focusing on those that will share our vision of providing a seamless experience, a consistency in this experience with physical points of presence.
And then we think there's an incremental opportunity in the market and a need to provide a monobrand experience, particularly around women's and apparel. We have actually seen this first hand in China. As you know, in China, with a relatively modest investment, there are monobrand stores that dramatically upscale how we serve consumers. I've had a chance to see this firsthand during my first weeks at NIKE in China, which I long for to get back out on the road, get back out in the market, get back out with consumers. That's coming again, I know. But I got to see firsthand the power of those monobrand stores. And so we'll be opening somewhere between 150 and 200 new stores. There'll be a small footprint, digitally-enabled monobrand stores in North America and EMEA.
It's -- we've been testing this format with NIKE Live and have a greater understanding of how to best deliver this experience. And so we will proceed ahead this year with more test-and-learn examples of it and scale it through the next couple of years. And again, to be clear, we believe this is incremental to what's in the market today. It's complementary to what we are already doing and our partners are doing. And at the end of the day, we believe that NIKE-owned physical and digital working hand-in-hand with our key partners, online and off-line, we can create one NIKE marketplace that meets the demand of consumers, now and in the future."

And as we continue to test the concept, we've been testing the assortment, we've been testing member engagement. We're seeing that members engage more frequently. It's serving to help us retain members. And so as John mentioned, this is why we see this as being a catalyst to digital growth, having local stores that members can engage with."

And they were working, frankly, when we came into the pandemic. And the pandemic, in many ways, was a stress test for them and really proved that our current strategy is working. So what we're talking about here is how do we take what might have taken us 3 to 5 years to make happen and make it happen in 2. And we -- I think there's some pretty fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that give us this opportunity to accelerate our progress. One shift is digital, right? As I said a minute ago, digital is now fundamental and central to everything consumers do, and we are the clear leader in digital. We'll double down on that. The second I just talked about was the marketplace of the future, right, where we believe we can drive toward one NIKE marketplace with our own capabilities and those of our partners. But third, and directly to your question, is aligning our organization against, a, a more simple construct of men's, women's and kids but also one that helps us unlock what we think are great growth opportunities, right, women's, apparel, kids and, frankly, the emerging health and wellness opportunity.
So this is not -- to be crystal clear, not abandoning the Consumer Direct Offense. This is accelerating it and refining it so that we're more directly connected to the biggest opportunities. Like women's, I'll just -- a great example, women's. We have less than 10% of the women's apparel market in the U.S. Women's grew this quarter 2x the rate of men. And this will allow us to align our organization and focus our resources more directly on that opportunity as well as on others. And so we view it as an acceleration, and I think it will result in more directly connecting and building deep consumer relationships, which will result in higher growth, market share. And as Matt said in his remarks, we believe also this is also healthy for profitability."

And if you think about it, in simple terms, membership is a big word, but in my mind, it breaks down to 3 simple things: do we have a one-on-one relationship, an identified one-on-one relationship with the consumer; can we increase our level of engagement with that consumer in value-added ways; and then does that increased engagement lead to greater retention and share of wallet of their purchases. And in terms of acquiring new members in the quarter, we had a phenomenal quarter. 25 million new members registered. That's up over 100%. Half of those came from our activity apps. And half the new members were women, which is a very encouraging sign.
And then that -- those new members and our existing members were highly engaged, particularly around Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, our SNKRS App. The stats are just -- I think I listed a few in my remarks, and Matt did. But NTC weekly active users, which is a really important metric -- because someone may only buy footwear and apparel a few times a year, but engaging with us each week, maybe even each day, brings NIKE into their lives. And so we grew weekly active users triple digits in the quarter. 25 million workouts with women alone in Q4, and that which is -- and so we think the activity levels and the engagement is growing.
And then it's really clear that increased engagement leads to increased purchases. And so the NIKE commerce app saw triple-digit growth in both downloads and monthly active buyers as well as the SNKRS App over $1 billion in first-time use. And so directly connecting with consumers, engaging them with our powerful portfolio of activity apps and then translating that into the kind of both digital and online and off-line relationships where they purchase more is kind of core to the strategy. The one NIKE marketplace, if you will, is designed to address that direct need."

And it starts with creating value for the consumer, which then translates into creating business value and, ultimately, value for the shareholders. And our focus is on creating sustainable, profitable long-term growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the shift to digital is financially accretive to NIKE. And we believe that this will be an enabler for us to sustain that momentum longer term. In the near term, or in any given period, obviously, we deal with foreign currency, we deal with anomalies that can have an impact on an interim period. But we're very confident in how this strategy will enable us to sustain that growth long term.
What I would tell you, because you asked the question about investment, we've been -- this quarter, in particular, was indicative of an opportunity for us where we managed SG&A very tightly, but we actually accelerated investment the way we needed to, to enable our employees to work from home, to enable digital demand, to do the things that we needed to do in order to be able to accommodate the environment in which we're operating. And as we look to the future, while we will accelerate investment against the areas that I referenced, we also see equal opportunity for us to shift resources that sit in our P&L in legacy forms, which we can redeploy again to the future. And so that's going to be our focus as we look towards the future. We will be investing, but we're going to try to -- we're going to accommodate it within the confines of our existing financial model."

As you know, Nike has always tried to carefully manage supply and demand. And as a premium brand, we maintain our premium nature because we try to optimize a full-price marketplace across our channels season after season after season. And so when the pandemic hit, it became clear that there was going to be excess inventory for a period of time. And we pulled many of the levers that we have at our disposal in order to be aggressive in addressing this issue. And in particular, we said our first and primary principle was to get inventory clean in the marketplace as fast as we possibly can. And so we now feel confident, based upon the actions that we've taken, that we will have inventory rightsized and clean by Q2 -- or in Q2. And in China, as I referenced, given they faced the pandemic a little bit earlier, they're going to clear and come out of the situation from an inventory perspective by the end of June. And so we feel very good about the actions that we've taken.
To your point, we are -- the marketplace is more promotional. We have shifted more units of liquidation through our factory store fleet because that's a brand right way for us to liquidate our inventory at a higher profitability level. But we are also seeing some discounting that's happening across the marketplace. But our discounting is less than what we're seeing across the broader marketplace. And our strong brand and our consumer connection is causing us to liquidate and move through inventory faster than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace. And so through the first 3 weeks of June, as I referenced, we feel like we're on track against this plan -- or we are on track against this plan and are confident that we're going to be positioned for the consumer and for the market in the second half of the year."

So I'm incredibly proud of our teams that work in our global operation and logistics because they delivered no small feat in the quarter, increasing the amount of volume that we could ship by 3x in North America and EMEA without much of an increase in cost on a per unit basis. And the reason why they could do that is because our current distribution capabilities are omnichannel, which means we can ship to wholesale customers, our factory stores and to digital. And that enabled us to be agile in the moment to increase our demand -- our digital demand fulfillment.
As we look forward, I mentioned that we're going to be investing in a new facility on the West Coast of the U.S. in order to be able to fulfill demand through holiday. And we expect that we will continue to invest in regional service centers in order to be able to fulfill demand closer to the consumer. But we're also enabling buy online -- we've also enabled buy online, pick up in store and ship from store from our stores, which will also be a way that we fulfill demand closer to the consumer. So I guess a long way of saying that we feel confident that we can continue to meet this digital demand. And our team continues to be able to expand capacity without it compromising our cost per unit. In fact, they continue to do what they can to mitigate cost per unit, and we believe it's a long-term opportunity for us as well."

The first thing I would say is that year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And th",489,"Sure, John. Let me break it down for you a little bit. The first thing I would say is that year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And that was on the back of a really strong product portfolio, innovation and then, ultimately, our digital business. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was impacted by COVID-19 and the decision that we took to prioritize cleaning and rightsizing our inventory by -- into Q2. And so the plans that we aggressively put in place to rebalance supply and demand did have an impact on our margins in Q4.
But let me break down the 820 for you maybe a little bit more. About 500 basis points of the impact was related to factory PO cancels, inventory obsolescence as we were making decisions about the value of our inventory and our plans to liquidate it and then the negative rate impact due to lower wholesale shipments on our supply chain costs. What that last point really means is that, as our press release said, our wholesale shipments were down 50%. But because our costs are mostly fixed, you see a rate -- a negative rate impact as a result of that. And so as wholesale shipments start to pick up, you'll see less of an impact as you look towards the future. And then we also had 70 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter.
As we look ahead to next year, we do expect the market to remain promotional in the first half. And in Q4, we had about 250 basis points impact from, like, promotional activity across our own stores and our partners as we were investing to liquidate inventory across the marketplace. As we look to the first half of next year, we expect that the marketplace will continue to be promotional as we and our partners are moving through this inventory to achieve our goal. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see sequential improvement relative to what we delivered in Q4 as we move quarter-by-quarter through the first half.
I think you also asked about bad debt. So bad debt sits in SG&A, it doesn't sit in margin. And it was $180 million in the quarter. I think that's really more reflective of the wholesale marketplace, and our risk assessment of some of our wholesale customers and the impact that this pandemic has had on their ability to pay NIKE for receivables that we're owed. And so if you connect the dots to what John said in terms of our strategic acceleration, we do believe that there's going to be consolidation and dislocation in wholesale distribution in North America and in EMEA. And that's why we're taking a measured approach to growth in those geos as we look forward to next year."

I also want to congratulate Matt on becoming our CFO and express how deeply confident I am in NIKE's financial management under Matt's leadership.
Before I get into our Q4 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the environment in the U.S. right now. Over the past month, we've seen racial tragedies expose systemic prejudice and injustice in America. And Nike has a long history of standing up against inequality driven by our values and rooted in the power of sport. Today, we are uniting behind our black athletes, teammates and community as NIKE continues to lead with purpose. And we're taking action to help create lasting change to address systemic racism in our society, including a combined $140 million commitment from NIKE, Converse, the Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan. And while we continue to lead externally, we also strive to be even better internally to meet the high bar we set for ourselves to be a truly diverse and inclusive company.
We're also continuing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the lives of so many across the globe. And throughout all of this, we have led with our values. We have executed with empathy and decisiveness. We prioritized the health and safety of our teammates by closing stores, offices and other facilities. We committed to provide pay continuity for all of our teammates even while our facilities remain closed or had altered schedules, and we have maintained this important investment over the past 12 weeks. Our innovation teams designed and delivered personal protective equipment to health systems across the country. We donated footwear and apparel to help frontline workers around the globe, and we've committed more than $25 million for COVID-19 response in our communities.
I must say that I've been so impressed and inspired by how our NIKE teammates around the world have come together and responded to this crisis. They have moved with speed and empathy and have demonstrated creativity, courage and true resilience. I could not be more proud of everyone on the NIKE team.
As we look back on this quarter, it demonstrated once again that NIKE's competitive advantage is driven by our team and by our brand's ability to connect with consumers. And this is fueled by our strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. And it's why I continue to believe no one is better positioned than Nike to navigate the current environment.
Now Matt will go deeper on Q4 in a minute, so I'll just hit on 5 quick observations from the quarter. First, the power of NIKE's brand continues. Leading with our values is drawing us closer to consumers. We use our ecosystem of NIKE activity and commerce apps to directly engage with consumers in their homes as they focus on health and wellness. During this difficult time, Nike has inspired and offered hope. And as a result, worldwide affinity for our brand deepened during COVID-19, with our You Can't Stop Us campaign receiving more than 2 billion impressions to date. Across all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand.
Second, Greater China has returned to currency-neutral growth. Over the quarter, we strengthened our consumer connections and translated them into meaningful relationships. For example, in March and April, China's monthly active users on the Nike Training app increased over 350% since the beginning of the calendar year. This direct engagement with consumers allowed our business in China to return to growth in Q4.
Third, we're seeing a true step function change in our digital transformation. As you know, this has been an area of investment over the past few years as we built our digital advantage, but COVID-19 has accelerated the pace. In Q4, NIKE Digital grew 79%, and we surpassed $1 billion in annual digital revenue in both Greater China and EMEA for the first time. We've seen the strong digital momentum continued throughout the quarter and into early June even as stores have begun to reopen.
Looking at our app ecosystem in Q4, a couple of stats jump out as we see an extraordinary leap in digital demand and engagement. Workouts on the Nike Training Club app more than tripled, peaking in April at nearly 5 million workouts per week during the month. Since February, the NIKE commerce app has been downloaded more than 8 million times, an increase that's triple last year's level, proving the power of our investment in digital. And in fiscal year '20, SNKRS reached an impressive milestone, reaching $1 billion in global demand for the first time.
Fourth observation on the quarter, the Jordan Brand resonated deeply in Q4 with the airing of ESPN's The Last Dance documentary. The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell-through of the AJ5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan Brand all over the world. In fact, the Jordan Brand in Greater China grew more than 50% in fiscal year '20, approaching $1 billion in annual revenue.
And Women's has played a key role in Jordan's growth. And we see significant opportunity for Jordan to achieve even greater scale as we create more products for women, expand lifestyle offerings and grow the business internationally. And even during a pandemic, Jordan drove some of the quarter's biggest launches, including the AJ1 and AJ13, a reminder of the continued strength of our consumer demand.
Fifth, and finally, innovation continues to be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. We continuously bring fresh new product to market supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. In Q4, we saw strong demand for the Pegasus 37, particularly with women, and for the Air Max 2019, a new sportswear silhouette that reimagines the future of Air. We also launched Space Hippie in our international geographies during June, with early success offering even more proof of global consumer appetite for sustainable product. And our unmatched investment in product innovation, even during a pandemic, will be proven with our most sustainable product ever, the VaporMax 2020 launching in July.
As I said earlier, Nike is in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger due to our Consumer Direct Offense. The global pandemic has made it clear that consumer behavior is changing rapidly, providing the opportunity for us to accelerate the pace of our transformation. Over the past few years, we have shifted from a legacy wholesale distribution model to investment in a model that gives our consumers a more premium shopping experience. And this is a change that has catalyzed our digital growth as part of our true Consumer Direct Offense, and COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound.
And so as we look to the future, here's what is not going to change: our purpose will continue to guide us, the power of sports will always be at our center and product innovation will continue to drive distinction for our brand. With these strengths in mind, we plan to accelerate our focus and investment on the key areas to put an even sharper point on our highest growth opportunities.
So today, we're announcing a new digitally empowered phase of our consumer direct strategy, the Consumer Direct Acceleration. We aren't settling for our current leadership position with consumers or in digital, we're pursuing even further separation. We're transforming NIKE faster to define the marketplace of the future. Now is the time to act.
Let me walk you through 3 areas of strategic acceleration: the marketplace of the future, our new consumer construct and our end-to-end technology foundation. First, we will create a marketplace of the future, one more closely aligned with what consumers want and need. Digital has redefined the industry over the past several years, and NIKE has led that change. You'll recall that in fiscal year '18, we set a goal to reach 30% digital penetration, both owned and partnered, by fiscal year '23. We will reach that goal more than 2 years ahead of plan this coming year. And looking ahead, we now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration.
As we look at opportunities to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers, our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace to match. Consumers want modern, seamless experiences online to off-line, so we're accelerating our approach. Our one NIKE marketplace strategy leads with NIKE Digital in our own stores and embraces a small number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium shopping experience. Connected data, inventory and membership will give consumers greater access to the best of NIKE with more speed and convenience than ever.
We've talked about membership as a growth driver and differentiator before, but now we'll align our business to make it central to everything we do. And as part of this strategy, we will also scale our investment in smaller-format, digitally enabled monobrand stores with integrated online to off-line capabilities. We believe this will be additive to what's in the market. These monobrand stores will accelerate the growth trajectory of NIKE's largest market share opportunity, like women's and apparel, driving long-term profitability.
Our second area of acceleration under Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will operate under a new, simpler consumer construct. We know that our consumers don't see themselves as only runners or yoga practitioners. They don't think in terms of performance versus sportswear. Instead, we know how they shop across men's, women's and kids. And so we'll realign the company to reflect the simplified men's, women's and kids approach. Our category focus will be more specialized across this consumer construct. Importantly, this consumer construct will allow us to significantly simplify our organization and focus more of our resources on the capabilities and opportunities that will forge our future. In particular, we'll be reinvesting in our women's and kids businesses. These intentional organizational focuses will touch every area of our business, including innovation, product creation, marketing, merchandising and distribution. Through this new consumer construct, we can serve performance sport with more specificity while also broadening the definition of sport. This approach allows us to better focus on the individual consumer and unlock new opportunities to more nimbly serve their exact needs.
And third, and finally, we will invest in digital capabilities in our end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our transformation. Simply put, we will more aggressively leverage technology to make NIKE better. This single integrated technology strategy across our business will accelerate how we serve consumers. Specifically, we'll speed up and unify our investments across demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and more. This simplified approach will unlock more efficiency for the business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.
Consumer Direct Acceleration is more than just the next phase of our strategy. It's the spark that will ignite and empower our entire company to serve consumers, our business and our teams better. As we shift our operating model to fuel this strategy, NIKE's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers amid a global shift towards health and wellness.
In the end, over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions, but our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. The strength of our brand, our deep connections to consumers and our unmatched product innovation give us an advantage to create and define our future. Fueled by the Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will shape the marketplace and extend our brand leadership for years to come.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations.Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I m",2517,"Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations.
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I must recognize and thank our incredible team around the world. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges, embracing new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our consumers in the face of unprecedented conditions. I could not be prouder to be a part of this team.
This quarter was certainly like no other in NIKE's history. As John mentioned, to protect the safety of our employees and to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 90% of our own stores, outside of Greater China and South Korea, were closed from operation for roughly 8 weeks in the quarter. Similarly, our wholesale partners largely followed this same pattern, and the sale of product through physical retail channels came to a halt.
Digital quickly became the primary channel that we could engage with and serve consumer demand, and NIKE was well positioned to respond. We accelerated growth of our digital business to 79% on a currency-neutral basis and drove nearly triple-digit acceleration in member digital demand. All told, NIKE Digital represented nearly 30% of our total business in the fourth quarter and reached $5.5 billion for the full year.
The net result of these 2 marketplace dynamics was that NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% on a reported basis. And yet, even in the midst of this global pandemic, we saw the power and distinction of the NIKE Brand translate into growing business momentum throughout the quarter, continuing into June.
Greater China returned to growth in Q4. And Nike Digital also accelerated growth each month in the quarter, including triple-digit growth globally in May even as physical retail reopened. These trends have sustained through the first 3 weeks of June, and in some markets, digital growth has accelerated even further. We believe this digital acceleration is more indicative of a strategic shift towards a new future marketplace rather than being a reflection of temporary challenges to the mostly physical marketplace of the past.
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year '21, 3 key themes stand out from a financial and operational perspective: NIKE's supply and demand management, NIKE's financial strength and NIKE's digital acceleration. Let me take a few minutes to unpack each of these.
First, at the end of Q4, inventory increased 31% versus prior year. In mid-March, we immediately went into action to rebuild our plans to recalibrate marketplace supply and demand around the world. As we have said before, supply and demand management is critical to sustaining a healthy premium brand. And over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our capabilities to manage through situations like this. Let me share a few specifics regarding what we have already done.
First, we modified our near-term inventory buying plans and proactively canceled pre-COVID-19 factory purchase orders for the fall and holiday seasons by roughly 30% on a unit basis. And while this had a negative impact on gross margins in Q4, it was the right decision to tighten future inventory movement through our supply chain and utilize the inventory we have on hand.
Second, we implemented a plan for a seasonless flow of inventory by shifting product offer dates so we can use relevant summer and fall product to meet near-term demand. We also edited product lines by up to 15% to improve SKU productivity.
Third, we quickly shifted available inventory to digital, and we increased digital fulfillment capacity by more than 3x in North America and EMEA.
And finally, we've invested in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate the liquidation of excess inventory while we protect the long-term health of our product franchises, including increasing the volume of liquidation through our factory store fleet.
In Greater China, this playbook has worked, and we expect our business will return to normalized marketplace health metrics by the end of June. In fact, we are already seeing inventory levels globally improve as well. And with our deliberate actions, we are confident that NIKE inventory will be rightsized and in a normal position in Q2.
This leads me to the second theme. NIKE's financial strength enables us to stay focused on the long term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation. In an environment where most companies are solely focused on survival, NIKE's financial strength, scale and adaptability allows us to make appropriate near-term decisions while investing to fuel long-term growth. We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity, including nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term investments, all supported by a strong investment-grade credit rating and a high return on invested capital. We continue to operate from a position of strength, and I would not trade our position with anyone.
Our current focus is to reduce discretionary spending while we invest in the digital capabilities necessary to further our competitive advantage in the marketplace. This includes improving the user experience on our digital platforms through enhanced digital commerce analytics, marketing technology for better consumer targeting and segmentation, online to off-line marketplace capabilities and enhanced inventory pricing and supply management tools. We will continue to increase the scale and efficiency of our digital fulfillment capabilities. In Q4, we already pivoted our new Adapt distribution facility in North America to fully support digital demand. And we plan to open a new regional service center on the West Coast before the holiday season to forward-deploy digital inventory, leveraging advanced analytics and demand-sensing capabilities from our acquisition of Celect.
Simply put, we have operating principles in place to prudently manage costs in the short term while we scale investment in key capabilities underpinning our digital transformation. We will continue to do this while managing SG&A tightly in the first half of fiscal year '21.
And last, a more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. The underlying value proposition of Nike's Consumer Direct Offense is that the consumer adoption of digital across all aspects of life now provides NIKE with an opportunity to create deeper, more direct consumer relationships at scale without disintermediation. As we've said before, the transformation to a more digital and direct business is financially accretive to NIKE. Our business results over the last 7 quarters pre-COVID-19 proved this point. As compared to our long-term financial model, NIKE has driven higher constant dollar revenue growth and roughly double the annual gross margin expansion on an operational basis, excluding the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds and tariffs.
The current economics of this transformational shift illustrates my point. On average, a sale of an incremental unit via digital generates double the revenue versus a sale to wholesale, with a higher gross margin translating into 2x the operating income dollars. And so to reiterate what John said in why this is so important, we now see that our owned and partner digital could grow to 50% of our total business in the foreseeable future, plus our measured investment in monobrand stores will further catalyze digital growth and create new distribution for our largest growth and market share opportunities in women's and apparel. We are calling this next phase of the Consumer Direct Offense an acceleration for a reason because it will drive greater growth; it will scale NIKE's direct consumer connections in our most profitable channels, driving higher consumer lifetime value; and it will enable us to reposition our resources to accelerate our transformation to a digital-first company.
Now let's turn to the details of our fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38%, down 36% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting the impact of NIKE-owned store closures and lower wholesale shipments, partially offset by growth in NIKE Digital.
Gross margin decreased 820 basis points in Q4 as higher full-price average selling prices, despite increased wholesale discounts, were more than offset by higher product costs, including factory cancellation charges and increased inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the adverse rate impact of supply chain fixed costs on lower wholesale shipments due to COVID-19 dynamics.
SG&A declined 6% in Q4. We reduced costs through clear enterprise-wide cost management principles, including reduction of marketing spending due to the cancellation of live sporting events and retail store closures. It's important to note that the decline in SG&A in the quarter included a roughly $180 million charge related to bad debt reserves.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.7% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year due to the mix of earnings taxed in the U.S. and favorability attributable to the use of foreign tax credits.
Fourth quarter diluted net loss per share was $0.51, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin related to COVID-19, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. And full year diluted EPS was $1.60, which includes a onetime noncash charge associated with the anticipated strategic distributor partnership transition in South America which reduced EPS by $0.25.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Last quarter, we discussed how each of our markets would progress from a business perspective as they emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak: first, a recovery period, including the ramp-up of store reopenings; second, a period of normalization of supply and demand; and third, a period in which we return to growth.
In Q4, Greater China and South Korea returned to growth. North America, EMEA and the remainder of APLA are still in the recovery period as stores began to reopen throughout May and early June.
In North America, Q4 revenue declined 46% on a currency-neutral basis. However, NIKE Digital grew 80%, and the Nike App grew triple digits and now represents 30% of our North America digital business. Women's full-price apparel grew 200% and was powered by strong new member growth, with women representing over half of new member acquisition in the quarter.
As retail began to reopen in mid-May, we saw strong double-digit growth in retail sales for our brand across the total North America marketplace. These trends have continued into early June, including NIKE Digital growing triple digits. Physical retail traffic remains below prior year and is being offset by higher rates of conversion due to promotional activity as well as significant shifts to owned and partner digital. And as of today, approximately 85% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 44% on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew nearly 100% with continued brand momentum and significant new member acquisition and engagement across the Nike Training Club and the Nike Running Club apps with active new member growth of over 200% and more than 18 million workouts logged in the quarter. And NIKE gained market share across both footwear and apparel becoming the #1 apparel brand during Q4 in key markets for the first time.
As retail began to reopen in May, we saw slight growth in total retail sales versus the prior year across the marketplace with better performance in Germany, France and the U.K., offset by slower recovery in Spain and Italy. Retail sales have now accelerated in June, including triple-digit NIKE Digital growth. Traffic levels, conversion trends and consumer shifts towards digital are similar to what we are seeing in North America. And as of today, approximately 90% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
With that, let's turn to Greater China where we returned to growth of 1% on a currency-neutral basis and the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Growth improved each month of the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in May on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew 53%, outpacing the industry. And the Nike App, which launched in Q3, is already resonating with consumers with nearly 11 million downloads driving over 10% of total digital demand in the fourth quarter. As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores are open. In June, we have seen a return to positive comparable store sales in NIKE-owned stores, with higher conversion and higher units per transaction more than offsetting lower traffic. NIKE Digital growth has accelerated to triple digits.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q4 revenue declined 39% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw varied COVID-19 impact across countries in the region with South Korea emerging the fastest, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. And digital growth was nearly 80% led by strength in Japan, Korea and Brazil, with women's growing 2x the rate of men's on NIKE Digital. As of today, approximately 65% of NIKE-owned stores are open with a higher percentage in South Korea, Japan and Australia while stores across Latin America remain largely closed due to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Fiscal year '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty as economies rebound from the effects of COVID-19 and seek to contain further outbreaks of the disease. We will be agile and resilient because we understand that each market recovery will not be linear. We remain focused on what we can control so that NIKE can manage risk and aggressively attack opportunities created in this environment.
Given the uncertainty that still remains, we will not be providing specific guidance. Today, however, I will share the approach we are taking to fiscal year '21 planning. In general, we expect to see sequential quarterly improvement in our financial results as retail reopens and each market normalizes supply and demand.
We expect revenue in the first half of the year to be below prior year levels but less of a decline than experienced in Q4 as we continue to reopen stores and fuel our digital business. We expect revenue in the second half to be up significantly versus the prior year with a healthy marketplace and a normalizing full-price sell-through across our channels. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be flat to up versus prior year. And of course, we will have greater clarity on our full year outlook 90 days from now.
Gross margin will continue in the short term to be a function of our supply and demand management actions as we prioritize the return to normalized inventory levels in Q2. As I said earlier, we have tightened our buys in the first half and are focused on moving through the inventory we have as profitably as we can. We expect SG&A to decline versus the prior year.
The financial and operating principles that will carry us through these unprecedented times are the same ones that have guided us over the decades. And our brand momentum and deep consumer connections, our differentiated product and continuous flow of innovation, our digital advantage and our operational capabilities have never been stronger. In addition, consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, leaving NIKE's market opportunity larger than ever. And though we can't predict short-term trends due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, interestingly enough, we can now see our brand's long-term future even more clearly.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know,",529,"Sure, Alexander (sic) [ Alexandra ]. In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know, are becoming accustomed to getting what they want, when they want it, how they want it, right? And this pandemic has really demonstrated the shift toward digital being at the center of everything they do, but they want modern and seamless experiences. They don't necessarily just want to buy it digitally and have it shipped from home. You're seeing during the pandemic, and we believe it will continue, they want to buy it on their digital device and go pick it up in the store. Or with soft goods, like apparel, they may want to reserve it online and try it on in the store. They may want to be in a store and buy something that's not in the store because of inventory, and the associate uses a digital device to buy it and get shipped home.
And so consumers increasingly want a consistent, seamless physical and digital experience. And so that's what we're committed to providing. And we're committed to providing those through, first and foremost, our own digital capabilities as well as our own digital stores, both factory -- or I'm sorry, our own physical stores, factory and direct. A very important piece of this is our strategic partners, our strategic wholesale partners. We envision having fewer of them but focusing on those that will share our vision of providing a seamless experience, a consistency in this experience with physical points of presence.
And then we think there's an incremental opportunity in the market and a need to provide a monobrand experience, particularly around women's and apparel. We have actually seen this first hand in China. As you know, in China, with a relatively modest investment, there are monobrand stores that dramatically upscale how we serve consumers. I've had a chance to see this firsthand during my first weeks at NIKE in China, which I long for to get back out on the road, get back out in the market, get back out with consumers. That's coming again, I know. But I got to see firsthand the power of those monobrand stores. And so we'll be opening somewhere between 150 and 200 new stores. There'll be a small footprint, digitally-enabled monobrand stores in North America and EMEA.
It's -- we've been testing this format with NIKE Live and have a greater understanding of how to best deliver this experience. And so we will proceed ahead this year with more test-and-learn examples of it and scale it through the next couple of years. And again, to be clear, we believe this is incremental to what's in the market today. It's complementary to what we are already doing and our partners are doing. And at the end of the day, we believe that NIKE-owned physical and digital working hand-in-hand with our key partners, online and off-line, we can create one NIKE marketplace that meets the demand of consumers, now and in the future."

It's serving to help us retain members. And so as John mentioned, this is why we see this as being a catalyst to digital growth, having local stores that members can engage with."

And they were working, frankly, when we came into the pandemic. And the pandemic, in many ways, was a stress test for them and really proved that our current strategy is working. So what we're talking about here is how do we take what might have taken us 3 to 5 years to make happen and make it happen in 2. And we -- I think there's some pretty fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that give us this opportunity to accelerate our progress. One shift is digital, right? As I said a minute ago, digital is now fundamental and central to everything consumers do, and we are the clear leader in digital. We'll double down on that. The second I just talked about was the marketplace of the future, right, where we believe we can drive toward one NIKE marketplace with our own capabilities and those of our partners. But third, and directly to your question, is aligning our organization against, a, a more simple construct of men's, women's and kids but also one that helps us unlock what we think are great growth opportunities, right, women's, apparel, kids and, frankly, the emerging health and wellness opportunity.
So this is not -- to be crystal clear, not abandoning the Consumer Direct Offense. This is accelerating it and refining it so that we're more directly connected to the biggest opportunities. Like women's, I'll just -- a great example, women's. We have less than 10% of the women's apparel market in the U.S. Women's grew this quarter 2x the rate of men. And this will allow us to align our organization and focus our resources more directly on that opportunity as well as on others. And so we view it as an acceleration, and I think it will result in more directly connecting and building deep consumer relationships, which will result in higher growth, market share. And as Matt said in his remarks, we believe also this is also healthy for profitability."

And if you think about it, in simple terms, membership is a big word, but in my mind, it breaks down to 3 simple things: do we have a one-on-one relationship, an identified one-on-one relationship with the consumer; can we increase our level of engagement with that consumer in value-added ways; and then does that increased engagement lead to greater retention and share of wallet of their purchases. And in terms of acquiring new members in the quarter, we had a phenomenal quarter. 25 million new members registered. That's up over 100%. Half of those came from our activity apps. And half the new members were women, which is a very encouraging sign.
And then that -- those new members and our existing members were highly engaged, particularly around Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, our SNKRS App. The stats are just -- I think I listed a few in my remarks, and Matt did. But NTC weekly active users, which is a really important metric -- because someone may only buy footwear and apparel a few times a year, but engaging with us each week, maybe even each day, brings NIKE into their lives. And so we grew weekly active users triple digits in the quarter. 25 million workouts with women alone in Q4, and that which is -- and so we think the activity levels and the engagement is growing.
And then it's really clear that increased engagement leads to increased purchases. And so the NIKE commerce app saw triple-digit growth in both downloads and monthly active buyers as well as the SNKRS App over $1 billion in first-time use. And so directly connecting with consumers, engaging them with our powerful portfolio of activity apps and then translating that into the kind of both digital and online and off-line relationships where they purchase more is kind of core to the strategy.

What I would tell you, because you asked the question about investment, we've been -- this quarter, in particular, was indicative of an opportunity for us where we managed SG&A very tightly, but we actually accelerated investment the way we needed to, to enable our employees to work from home, to enable digital demand, to do the things that we needed to do in order to be able to accommodate the environment in which we're operating. And as we look to the future, while we will accelerate investment against the areas that I referenced, we also see equal opportunity for us to shift resources that sit in our P&L in legacy forms, which we can redeploy again to the future. And so that's going to be our focus as we look towards the future. We will be investing, but we're going to try to -- we're going to accommodate it within the confines of our existing financial model."

As you know, Nike has always tried to carefully manage supply and demand. And as a premium brand, we maintain our premium nature because we try to optimize a full-price marketplace across our channels season after season after season. And so when the pandemic hit, it became clear that there was going to be excess inventory for a period of time. And we pulled many of the levers that we have at our disposal in order to be aggressive in addressing this issue. And in particular, we said our first and primary principle was to get inventory clean in the marketplace as fast as we possibly can. And so we now feel confident, based upon the actions that we've taken, that we will have inventory rightsized and clean by Q2 -- or in Q2. And in China, as I referenced, given they faced the pandemic a little bit earlier, they're going to clear and come out of the situation from an inventory perspective by the end of June. And so we feel very good about the actions that we've taken.
To your point, we are -- the marketplace is more promotional. We have shifted more units of liquidation through our factory store fleet because that's a brand right way for us to liquidate our inventory at a higher profitability level. But we are also seeing some discounting that's happening across the marketplace. But our discounting is less than what we're seeing across the broader marketplace. And our strong brand and our consumer connection is causing us to liquidate and move through inventory faster than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace. And so through the first 3 weeks of June, as I referenced, we feel like we're on track against this plan -- or we are on track against this plan and are confident that we're going to be positioned for the consumer and for the market in the second half of the year."

So I'm incredibly proud of our teams that work in our global operation and logistics because they delivered no small feat in the quarter, increasing the amount of volume that we could ship by 3x in North America and EMEA without much of an increase in cost on a per unit basis. And the reason why they could do that is because our current distribution capabilities are omnichannel, which means we can ship to wholesale customers, our factory stores and to digital. And that enabled us to be agile in the moment to increase our demand -- our digital demand fulfillment.
As we look forward, I mentioned that we're going to be investing in a new facility on the West Coast of the U.S. in order to be able to fulfill demand through holiday. And we expect that we will continue to invest in regional service centers in order to be able to fulfill demand closer to the consumer. But we're also enabling buy online -- we've also enabled buy online, pick up in store and ship from store from our stores, which will also be a way that we fulfill demand closer to the consumer. So I guess a long way of saying that we feel confident that we can continue to meet this digital demand. And our team continues to be able to expand capacity without it compromising our cost per unit. In fact, they continue to do what they can to mitigate cost per unit, and we believe it's a long-term opportunity for us as well."

And that's going to allow us to build scale that others won't be able to match. And we want to share that scale with our wholesale partners and others as we embrace this.

And th",489,"Sure, John. Let me break it down for you a little bit. The first thing I would say is that year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And that was on the back of a really strong product portfolio, innovation and then, ultimately, our digital business. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was impacted by COVID-19 and the decision that we took to prioritize cleaning and rightsizing our inventory by -- into Q2. And so the plans that we aggressively put in place to rebalance supply and demand did have an impact on our margins in Q4.
But let me break down the 820 for you maybe a little bit more. About 500 basis points of the impact was related to factory PO cancels, inventory obsolescence as we were making decisions about the value of our inventory and our plans to liquidate it and then the negative rate impact due to lower wholesale shipments on our supply chain costs. What that last point really means is that, as our press release said, our wholesale shipments were down 50%. But because our costs are mostly fixed, you see a rate -- a negative rate impact as a result of that. And so as wholesale shipments start to pick up, you'll see less of an impact as you look towards the future. And then we also had 70 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter.
As we look ahead to next year, we do expect the market to remain promotional in the first half. And in Q4, we had about 250 basis points impact from, like, promotional activity across our own stores and our partners as we were investing to liquidate inventory across the marketplace. As we look to the first half of next year, we expect that the marketplace will continue to be promotional as we and our partners are moving through this inventory to achieve our goal. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see sequential improvement relative to what we delivered in Q4 as we move quarter-by-quarter through the first half.
I think you also asked about bad debt. So bad debt sits in SG&A, it doesn't sit in margin. And it was $180 million in the quarter. I think that's really more reflective of the wholesale marketplace, and our risk assessment of some of our wholesale customers and the impact that this pandemic has had on their ability to pay NIKE for receivables that we're owed. And so if you connect the dots to what John said in terms of our strategic acceleration, we do believe that there's going to be consolidation and dislocation in wholesale distribution in North America and in EMEA. And that's why we're taking a measured approach to growth in those geos as we look forward to next year."

I also want to congratulate Matt on becoming our CFO and express how deeply confident I am in NIKE's financial management under Matt's leadership.
Before I get into our Q4 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the environment in the U.S. right now. Over the past month, we've seen racial tragedies expose systemic prejudice and injustice in America. And Nike has a long history of standing up against inequality driven by our values and rooted in the power of sport. Today, we are uniting behind our black athletes, teammates and community as NIKE continues to lead with purpose. And we're taking action to help create lasting change to address systemic racism in our society, including a combined $140 million commitment from NIKE, Converse, the Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan. And while we continue to lead externally, we also strive to be even better internally to meet the high bar we set for ourselves to be a truly diverse and inclusive company.
We're also continuing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the lives of so many across the globe. And throughout all of this, we have led with our values. We have executed with empathy and decisiveness. We prioritized the health and safety of our teammates by closing stores, offices and other facilities. We committed to provide pay continuity for all of our teammates even while our facilities remain closed or had altered schedules, and we have maintained this important investment over the past 12 weeks. Our innovation teams designed and delivered personal protective equipment to health systems across the country. We donated footwear and apparel to help frontline workers around the globe, and we've committed more than $25 million for COVID-19 response in our communities.
I must say that I've been so impressed and inspired by how our NIKE teammates around the world have come together and responded to this crisis. They have moved with speed and empathy and have demonstrated creativity, courage and true resilience. I could not be more proud of everyone on the NIKE team.
As we look back on this quarter, it demonstrated once again that NIKE's competitive advantage is driven by our team and by our brand's ability to connect with consumers. And this is fueled by our strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. And it's why I continue to believe no one is better positioned than Nike to navigate the current environment.
Now Matt will go deeper on Q4 in a minute, so I'll just hit on 5 quick observations from the quarter. First, the power of NIKE's brand continues. Leading with our values is drawing us closer to consumers. We use our ecosystem of NIKE activity and commerce apps to directly engage with consumers in their homes as they focus on health and wellness. During this difficult time, Nike has inspired and offered hope. And as a result, worldwide affinity for our brand deepened during COVID-19, with our You Can't Stop Us campaign receiving more than 2 billion impressions to date. Across all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand.
Second, Greater China has returned to currency-neutral growth. Over the quarter, we strengthened our consumer connections and translated them into meaningful relationships. For example, in March and April, China's monthly active users on the Nike Training app increased over 350% since the beginning of the calendar year. This direct engagement with consumers allowed our business in China to return to growth in Q4.
Third, we're seeing a true step function change in our digital transformation. As you know, this has been an area of investment over the past few years as we built our digital advantage, but COVID-19 has accelerated the pace. In Q4, NIKE Digital grew 79%, and we surpassed $1 billion in annual digital revenue in both Greater China and EMEA for the first time. We've seen the strong digital momentum continued throughout the quarter and into early June even as stores have begun to reopen.
Looking at our app ecosystem in Q4, a couple of stats jump out as we see an extraordinary leap in digital demand and engagement. Workouts on the Nike Training Club app more than tripled, peaking in April at nearly 5 million workouts per week during the month. Since February, the NIKE commerce app has been downloaded more than 8 million times, an increase that's triple last year's level, proving the power of our investment in digital. And in fiscal year '20, SNKRS reached an impressive milestone, reaching $1 billion in global demand for the first time.
Fourth observation on the quarter, the Jordan Brand resonated deeply in Q4 with the airing of ESPN's The Last Dance documentary. The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell-through of the AJ5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan Brand all over the world. In fact, the Jordan Brand in Greater China grew more than 50% in fiscal year '20, approaching $1 billion in annual revenue.
And Women's has played a key role in Jordan's growth. And we see significant opportunity for Jordan to achieve even greater scale as we create more products for women, expand lifestyle offerings and grow the business internationally. And even during a pandemic, Jordan drove some of the quarter's biggest launches, including the AJ1 and AJ13, a reminder of the continued strength of our consumer demand.
Fifth, and finally, innovation continues to be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. We continuously bring fresh new product to market supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. In Q4, we saw strong demand for the Pegasus 37, particularly with women, and for the Air Max 2019, a new sportswear silhouette that reimagines the future of Air. We also launched Space Hippie in our international geographies during June, with early success offering even more proof of global consumer appetite for sustainable product. And our unmatched investment in product innovation, even during a pandemic, will be proven with our most sustainable product ever, the VaporMax 2020 launching in July.
As I said earlier, Nike is in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger due to our Consumer Direct Offense. The global pandemic has made it clear that consumer behavior is changing rapidly, providing the opportunity for us to accelerate the pace of our transformation. Over the past few years, we have shifted from a legacy wholesale distribution model to investment in a model that gives our consumers a more premium shopping experience. And this is a change that has catalyzed our digital growth as part of our true Consumer Direct Offense, and COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound.
And so as we look to the future, here's what is not going to change: our purpose will continue to guide us, the power of sports will always be at our center and product innovation will continue to drive distinction for our brand. With these strengths in mind, we plan to accelerate our focus and investment on the key areas to put an even sharper point on our highest growth opportunities.
So today, we're announcing a new digitally empowered phase of our consumer direct strategy, the Consumer Direct Acceleration. We aren't settling for our current leadership position with consumers or in digital, we're pursuing even further separation. We're transforming NIKE faster to define the marketplace of the future. Now is the time to act.
Let me walk you through 3 areas of strategic acceleration: the marketplace of the future, our new consumer construct and our end-to-end technology foundation. First, we will create a marketplace of the future, one more closely aligned with what consumers want and need. Digital has redefined the industry over the past several years, and NIKE has led that change. You'll recall that in fiscal year '18, we set a goal to reach 30% digital penetration, both owned and partnered, by fiscal year '23. We will reach that goal more than 2 years ahead of plan this coming year. And looking ahead, we now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration.
As we look at opportunities to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers, our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace to match. Consumers want modern, seamless experiences online to off-line, so we're accelerating our approach. Our one NIKE marketplace strategy leads with NIKE Digital in our own stores and embraces a small number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium shopping experience. Connected data, inventory and membership will give consumers greater access to the best of NIKE with more speed and convenience than ever.
We've talked about membership as a growth driver and differentiator before, but now we'll align our business to make it central to everything we do. And as part of this strategy, we will also scale our investment in smaller-format, digitally enabled monobrand stores with integrated online to off-line capabilities. We believe this will be additive to what's in the market. These monobrand stores will accelerate the growth trajectory of NIKE's largest market share opportunity, like women's and apparel, driving long-term profitability.
Our second area of acceleration under Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will operate under a new, simpler consumer construct. We know that our consumers don't see themselves as only runners or yoga practitioners. They don't think in terms of performance versus sportswear. Instead, we know how they shop across men's, women's and kids. And so we'll realign the company to reflect the simplified men's, women's and kids approach. Our category focus will be more specialized across this consumer construct. Importantly, this consumer construct will allow us to significantly simplify our organization and focus more of our resources on the capabilities and opportunities that will forge our future. In particular, we'll be reinvesting in our women's and kids businesses. These intentional organizational focuses will touch every area of our business, including innovation, product creation, marketing, merchandising and distribution. Through this new consumer construct, we can serve performance sport with more specificity while also broadening the definition of sport. This approach allows us to better focus on the individual consumer and unlock new opportunities to more nimbly serve their exact needs.
And third, and finally, we will invest in digital capabilities in our end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our transformation. Simply put, we will more aggressively leverage technology to make NIKE better. This single integrated technology strategy across our business will accelerate how we serve consumers. Specifically, we'll speed up and unify our investments across demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and more. This simplified approach will unlock more efficiency for the business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.
Consumer Direct Acceleration is more than just the next phase of our strategy. It's the spark that will ignite and empower our entire company to serve consumers, our business and our teams better. As we shift our operating model to fuel this strategy, NIKE's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers amid a global shift towards health and wellness.
In the end, over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions, but our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. The strength of our brand, our deep connections to consumers and our unmatched product innovation give us an advantage to create and define our future. Fueled by the Consumer Direct Acceleration, Nike will shape the marketplace and extend our brand leadership for years to come.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call as she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations.
Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I must recognize and thank our incredible team around the world. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges, embracing new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our consumers in the face of unprecedented conditions. I could not be prouder to be a part of this team.
This quarter was certainly like no other in NIKE's history. As John mentioned, to protect the safety of our employees and to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 90% of our own stores, outside of Greater China and South Korea, were closed from operation for roughly 8 weeks in the quarter. Similarly, our wholesale partners largely followed this same pattern, and the sale of product through physical retail channels came to a halt.
Digital quickly became the primary channel that we could engage with and serve consumer demand, and NIKE was well positioned to respond. We accelerated growth of our digital business to 79% on a currency-neutral basis and drove nearly triple-digit acceleration in member digital demand. All told, NIKE Digital represented nearly 30% of our total business in the fourth quarter and reached $5.5 billion for the full year.
The net result of these 2 marketplace dynamics was that NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% on a reported basis. And yet, even in the midst of this global pandemic, we saw the power and distinction of the NIKE Brand translate into growing business momentum throughout the quarter, continuing into June.
Greater China returned to growth in Q4. And Nike Digital also accelerated growth each month in the quarter, including triple-digit growth globally in May even as physical retail reopened. These trends have sustained through the first 3 weeks of June, and in some markets, digital growth has accelerated even further. We believe this digital acceleration is more indicative of a strategic shift towards a new future marketplace rather than being a reflection of temporary challenges to the mostly physical marketplace of the past.
Now as we look ahead to fiscal year '21, 3 key themes stand out from a financial and operational perspective: NIKE's supply and demand management, NIKE's financial strength and NIKE's digital acceleration. Let me take a few minutes to unpack each of these.
First, at the end of Q4, inventory increased 31% versus prior year. In mid-March, we immediately went into action to rebuild our plans to recalibrate marketplace supply and demand around the world. As we have said before, supply and demand management is critical to sustaining a healthy premium brand. And over the past 3 years, we have enhanced our capabilities to manage through situations like this. Let me share a few specifics regarding what we have already done.
First, we modified our near-term inventory buying plans and proactively canceled pre-COVID-19 factory purchase orders for the fall and holiday seasons by roughly 30% on a unit basis. And while this had a negative impact on gross margins in Q4, it was the right decision to tighten future inventory movement through our supply chain and utilize the inventory we have on hand.
Second, we implemented a plan for a seasonless flow of inventory by shifting product offer dates so we can use relevant summer and fall product to meet near-term demand. We also edited product lines by up to 15% to improve SKU productivity.
Third, we quickly shifted available inventory to digital, and we increased digital fulfillment capacity by more than 3x in North America and EMEA.
And finally, we've invested in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate the liquidation of excess inventory while we protect the long-term health of our product franchises, including increasing the volume of liquidation through our factory store fleet.
In Greater China, this playbook has worked, and we expect our business will return to normalized marketplace health metrics by the end of June. In fact, we are already seeing inventory levels globally improve as well. And with our deliberate actions, we are confident that NIKE inventory will be rightsized and in a normal position in Q2.
This leads me to the second theme. NIKE's financial strength enables us to stay focused on the long term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation. In an environment where most companies are solely focused on survival, NIKE's financial strength, scale and adaptability allows us to make appropriate near-term decisions while investing to fuel long-term growth. We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity, including nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term investments, all supported by a strong investment-grade credit rating and a high return on invested capital. We continue to operate from a position of strength, and I would not trade our position with anyone.
Our current focus is to reduce discretionary spending while we invest in the digital capabilities necessary to further our competitive advantage in the marketplace. This includes improving the user experience on our digital platforms through enhanced digital commerce analytics, marketing technology for better consumer targeting and segmentation, online to off-line marketplace capabilities and enhanced inventory pricing and supply management tools. We will continue to increase the scale and efficiency of our digital fulfillment capabilities. In Q4, we already pivoted our new Adapt distribution facility in North America to fully support digital demand. And we plan to open a new regional service center on the West Coast before the holiday season to forward-deploy digital inventory, leveraging advanced analytics and demand-sensing capabilities from our acquisition of Celect.
Simply put, we have operating principles in place to prudently manage costs in the short term while we scale investment in key capabilities underpinning our digital transformation. We will continue to do this while managing SG&A tightly in the first half of fiscal year '21.
And last, a more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. The underlying value proposition of Nike's Consumer Direct Offense is that the consumer adoption of digital across all aspects of life now provides NIKE with an opportunity to create deeper, more direct consumer relationships at scale without disintermediation. As we've said before, the transformation to a more digital and direct business is financially accretive to NIKE. Our business results over the last 7 quarters pre-COVID-19 proved this point. As compared to our long-term financial model, NIKE has driven higher constant dollar revenue growth and roughly double the annual gross margin expansion on an operational basis, excluding the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds and tariffs.
The current economics of this transformational shift illustrates my point. On average, a sale of an incremental unit via digital generates double the revenue versus a sale to wholesale, with a higher gross margin translating into 2x the operating income dollars. And so to reiterate what John said in why this is so important, we now see that our owned and partner digital could grow to 50% of our total business in the foreseeable future, plus our measured investment in monobrand stores will further catalyze digital growth and create new distribution for our largest growth and market share opportunities in women's and apparel. We are calling this next phase of the Consumer Direct Offense an acceleration for a reason because it will drive greater growth; it will scale NIKE's direct consumer connections in our most profitable channels, driving higher consumer lifetime value; and it will enable us to reposition our resources to accelerate our transformation to a digital-first company.
Now let's turn to the details of our fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38%, down 36% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting the impact of NIKE-owned store closures and lower wholesale shipments, partially offset by growth in NIKE Digital.
Gross margin decreased 820 basis points in Q4 as higher full-price average selling prices, despite increased wholesale discounts, were more than offset by higher product costs, including factory cancellation charges and increased inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the adverse rate impact of supply chain fixed costs on lower wholesale shipments due to COVID-19 dynamics.
SG&A declined 6% in Q4. We reduced costs through clear enterprise-wide cost management principles, including reduction of marketing spending due to the cancellation of live sporting events and retail store closures. It's important to note that the decline in SG&A in the quarter included a roughly $180 million charge related to bad debt reserves.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.7% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year due to the mix of earnings taxed in the U.S. and favorability attributable to the use of foreign tax credits.
Fourth quarter diluted net loss per share was $0.51, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin related to COVID-19, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. And full year diluted EPS was $1.60, which includes a onetime noncash charge associated with the anticipated strategic distributor partnership transition in South America which reduced EPS by $0.25.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Last quarter, we discussed how each of our markets would progress from a business perspective as they emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak: first, a recovery period, including the ramp-up of store reopenings; second, a period of normalization of supply and demand; and third, a period in which we return to growth.
In Q4, Greater China and South Korea returned to growth. North America, EMEA and the remainder of APLA are still in the recovery period as stores began to reopen throughout May and early June.
In North America, Q4 revenue declined 46% on a currency-neutral basis. However, NIKE Digital grew 80%, and the Nike App grew triple digits and now represents 30% of our North America digital business. Women's full-price apparel grew 200% and was powered by strong new member growth, with women representing over half of new member acquisition in the quarter.
As retail began to reopen in mid-May, we saw strong double-digit growth in retail sales for our brand across the total North America marketplace. These trends have continued into early June, including NIKE Digital growing triple digits. Physical retail traffic remains below prior year and is being offset by higher rates of conversion due to promotional activity as well as significant shifts to owned and partner digital. And as of today, approximately 85% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 44% on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew nearly 100% with continued brand momentum and significant new member acquisition and engagement across the Nike Training Club and the Nike Running Club apps with active new member growth of over 200% and more than 18 million workouts logged in the quarter. And NIKE gained market share across both footwear and apparel becoming the #1 apparel brand during Q4 in key markets for the first time.
As retail began to reopen in May, we saw slight growth in total retail sales versus the prior year across the marketplace with better performance in Germany, France and the U.K., offset by slower recovery in Spain and Italy. Retail sales have now accelerated in June, including triple-digit NIKE Digital growth. Traffic levels, conversion trends and consumer shifts towards digital are similar to what we are seeing in North America. And as of today, approximately 90% of NIKE-owned stores are open.
With that, let's turn to Greater China where we returned to growth of 1% on a currency-neutral basis and the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Growth improved each month of the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in May on a currency-neutral basis. Digital grew 53%, outpacing the industry. And the Nike App, which launched in Q3, is already resonating with consumers with nearly 11 million downloads driving over 10% of total digital demand in the fourth quarter. As of today, 100% of NIKE-owned stores are open. In June, we have seen a return to positive comparable store sales in NIKE-owned stores, with higher conversion and higher units per transaction more than offsetting lower traffic. NIKE Digital growth has accelerated to triple digits.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q4 revenue declined 39% on a currency-neutral basis. We saw varied COVID-19 impact across countries in the region with South Korea emerging the fastest, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. And digital growth was nearly 80% led by strength in Japan, Korea and Brazil, with women's growing 2x the rate of men's on NIKE Digital. As of today, approximately 65% of NIKE-owned stores are open with a higher percentage in South Korea, Japan and Australia while stores across Latin America remain largely closed due to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Fiscal year '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty as economies rebound from the effects of COVID-19 and seek to contain further outbreaks of the disease. We will be agile and resilient because we understand that each market recovery will not be linear. We remain focused on what we can control so that NIKE can manage risk and aggressively attack opportunities created in this environment.
Given the uncertainty that still remains, we will not be providing specific guidance. Today, however, I will share the approach we are taking to fiscal year '21 planning. In general, we expect to see sequential quarterly improvement in our financial results as retail reopens and each market normalizes supply and demand.
We expect revenue in the first half of the year to be below prior year levels but less of a decline than experienced in Q4 as we continue to reopen stores and fuel our digital business. We expect revenue in the second half to be up significantly versus the prior year with a healthy marketplace and a normalizing full-price sell-through across our channels. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be flat to up versus prior year. And of course, we will have greater clarity on our full year outlook 90 days from now.
Gross margin will continue in the short term to be a function of our supply and demand management actions as we prioritize the return to normalized inventory levels in Q2. As I said earlier, we have tightened our buys in the first half and are focused on moving through the inventory we have as profitably as we can. We expect SG&A to decline versus the prior year.
The financial and operating principles that will carry us through these unprecedented times are the same ones that have guided us over the decades. And our brand momentum and deep consumer connections, our differentiated product and continuous flow of innovation, our digital advantage and our operational capabilities have never been stronger. In addition, consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, leaving NIKE's market opportunity larger than ever. And though we can't predict short-term trends due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, interestingly enough, we can now see our brand's long-term future even more clearly.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know,",529,"Sure, Alexander (sic) [ Alexandra ]. In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And here's -- we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers, as you know, are becoming accustomed to getting what they want, when they want it, how they want it, right? And this pandemic has really demonstrated the shift toward digital being at the center of everything they do, but they want modern and seamless experiences. They don't necessarily just want to buy it digitally and have it shipped from home. You're seeing during the pandemic, and we believe it will continue, they want to buy it on their digital device and go pick it up in the store. Or with soft goods, like apparel, they may want to reserve it online and try it on in the store. They may want to be in a store and buy something that's not in the store because of inventory, and the associate uses a digital device to buy it and get shipped home.
And so consumers increasingly want a consistent, seamless physical and digital experience. And so that's what we're committed to providing. And we're committed to providing those through, first and foremost, our own digital capabilities as well as our own digital stores, both factory -- or I'm sorry, our own physical stores, factory and direct. A very important piece of this is our strategic partners, our strategic wholesale partners. We envision having fewer of them but focusing on those that will share our vision of providing a seamless experience, a consistency in this experience with physical points of presence.
And then we think there's an incremental opportunity in the market and a need to provide a monobrand experience, particularly around women's and apparel. We have actually seen this first hand in China. As you know, in China, with a relatively modest investment, there are monobrand stores that dramatically upscale how we serve consumers. I've had a chance to see this firsthand during my first weeks at NIKE in China, which I long for to get back out on the road, get back out in the market, get back out with consumers. That's coming again, I know. But I got to see firsthand the power of those monobrand stores. And so we'll be opening somewhere between 150 and 200 new stores. There'll be a small footprint, digitally-enabled monobrand stores in North America and EMEA.
It's -- we've been testing this format with NIKE Live and have a greater understanding of how to best deliver this experience. And so we will proceed ahead this year with more test-and-learn examples of it and scale it through the next couple of years. And again, to be clear, we believe this is incremental to what's in the market today. It's complementary to what we are already doing and our partners are doing. And at the end of the day, we believe that NIKE-owned physical and digital working hand-in-hand with our key partners, online and off-line, we can create one NIKE marketplace that meets the demand of consumers, now and in the future."

And they were working, frankly, when we came into the pandemic. And the pandemic, in many ways, was a stress test for them and really proved that our current strategy is working. So what we're talking about here is how do we take what might have taken us 3 to 5 years to make happen and make it happen in 2. And we -- I think there's some pretty fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that give us this opportunity to accelerate our progress. One shift is digital, right? As I said a minute ago, digital is now fundamental and central to everything consumers do, and we are the clear leader in digital. We'll double down on that. The second I just talked about was the marketplace of the future, right, where we believe we can drive toward one NIKE marketplace with our own capabilities and those of our partners. But third, and directly to your question, is aligning our organization against, a, a more simple construct of men's, women's and kids but also one that helps us unlock what we think are great growth opportunities, right, women's, apparel, kids and, frankly, the emerging health and wellness opportunity.
So this is not -- to be crystal clear, not abandoning the Consumer Direct Offense. This is accelerating it and refining it so that we're more directly connected to the biggest opportunities. Like women's, I'll just -- a great example, women's. We have less than 10% of the women's apparel market in the U.S. Women's grew this quarter 2x the rate of men. And this will allow us to align our organization and focus our resources more directly on that opportunity as well as on others. And so we view it as an acceleration, and I think it will result in more directly connecting and building deep consumer relationships, which will result in higher growth, market share. And as Matt said in his remarks, we believe also this is also healthy for profitability."

And if you think about it, in simple terms, membership is a big word, but in my mind, it breaks down to 3 simple things: do we have a one-on-one relationship, an identified one-on-one relationship with the consumer; can we increase our level of engagement with that consumer in value-added ways; and then does that increased engagement lead to greater retention and share of wallet of their purchases. And in terms of acquiring new members in the quarter, we had a phenomenal quarter. 25 million new members registered. That's up over 100%. Half of those came from our activity apps. And half the new members were women, which is a very encouraging sign.
And then that -- those new members and our existing members were highly engaged, particularly around Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, our SNKRS App. The stats are just -- I think I listed a few in my remarks, and Matt did. But NTC weekly active users, which is a really important metric -- because someone may only buy footwear and apparel a few times a year, but engaging with us each week, maybe even each day, brings NIKE into their lives. And so we grew weekly active users triple digits in the quarter. 25 million workouts with women alone in Q4, and that which is -- and so we think the activity levels and the engagement is growing.
And then it's really clear that increased engagement leads to increased purchases. And so the NIKE commerce app saw triple-digit growth in both downloads and monthly active buyers as well as the SNKRS App over $1 billion in first-time use. And so directly connecting with consumers, engaging them with our powerful portfolio of activity apps and then translating that into the kind of both digital and online and off-line relationships where they purchase more is kind of core to the strategy.

What I would tell you, because you asked the question about investment, we've been -- this quarter, in particular, was indicative of an opportunity for us where we managed SG&A very tightly, but we actually accelerated investment the way we needed to, to enable our employees to work from home, to enable digital demand, to do the things that we needed to do in order to be able to accommodate the environment in which we're operating. And as we look to the future while we will accelerate investment against the areas that I referenced, we also see equal opportunity for us to shift resources that sit in our P&L in legacy forms, which we can redeploy again to the future.

As you know, Nike has always tried to carefully manage supply and demand. And as a premium brand, we maintain our premium nature because we try to optimize a full-price marketplace across our channels season after season after season. And so when the pandemic hit, it became clear that there was going to be excess inventory for a period of time. And we pulled many of the levers that we have at our disposal in order to be aggressive in addressing this issue. And in particular, we said our first and primary principle was to get inventory clean in the marketplace as fast as we possibly can. And so we now feel confident, based upon the actions that we've taken, that we will have inventory rightsized and clean by Q2 -- or in Q2. And in China, as I referenced, given they faced the pandemic a little bit earlier, they're going to clear and come out of the situation from an inventory perspective by the end of June. And so we feel very good about the actions that we've taken.
To your point, we are -- the marketplace is more promotional. We have shifted more units of liquidation through our factory store fleet because that's a brand right way for us to liquidate our inventory at a higher profitability level. But we are also seeing some discounting that's happening across the marketplace. But our discounting is less than what we're seeing across the broader marketplace. And our strong brand and our consumer connection is causing us to liquidate and move through inventory faster than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace. And so through the first 3 weeks of June, as I referenced, we feel like we're on track against this plan -- or we are on track against this plan and are confident that we're going to be positioned for the consumer and for the market in the second half of the year."

So I'm incredibly proud of our teams that work in our global operation and logistics because they delivered no small feat in the quarter, increasing the amount of volume that we could ship by 3x in North America and EMEA without much of an increase in cost on a per unit basis. And the reason why they could do that is because our current distribution capabilities are omnichannel, which means we can ship to wholesale customers, our factory stores and to digital. And that enabled us to be agile in the moment to increase our demand -- our digital demand fulfillment.
As we look forward, I mentioned that we're going to be investing in a new facility on the West Coast of the U.S. in order to be able to fulfill demand through holiday. And we expect that we will continue to invest in regional service centers in order to be able to fulfill demand closer to the consumer. But we're also enabling buy online -- we've also enabled buy online, pick up in store and ship from store from our stores, which will also be a way that we fulfill demand closer to the consumer. So I guess a long way of saying that we feel confident that we can continue to meet this digital demand. And our team continues to be able to expand capacity without it compromising our cost per unit. In fact, they continue to do what they can to mitigate cost per unit, and we believe it's a long-term opportunity for us as well."

That was initially constructed to serve wholesale but has now been completely redeployed to serve direct-to-consumer.
And I think, Matt, you referenced the power of data, right, the power of that Celect acquisition where advanced analytics and data -- demand-sensing capabilities can allow us to get the right product as close to the consumer in the right time, which offers enormous efficiency opportunities, right, and by the way, that's a scale game. And that's going to allow us to build scale that others won't be able to match. And we want to share that scale with our wholesale partners and others as we embrace this. And so it was really great to see that team, and they've done a phenomenal job as their counterparts in Europe and in China."

The first thing I would say is that year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And th",489,"Sure, John. Let me break it down for you a little bit. The first thing I would say is that year-to-date, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal year '20, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. And that was on the back of a really strong product portfolio, innovation and then, ultimately, our digital business. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was impacted by COVID-19 and the decision that we took to prioritize cleaning and rightsizing our inventory by -- into Q2. And so the plans that we aggressively put in place to rebalance supply and demand did have an impact on our margins in Q4.
But let me break down the 820 for you maybe a little bit more. About 500 basis points of the impact was related to factory PO cancels, inventory obsolescence as we were making decisions about the value of our inventory and our plans to liquidate it and then the negative rate impact due to lower wholesale shipments on our supply chain costs. What that last point really means is that, as our press release said, our wholesale shipments were down 50%. But because our costs are mostly fixed, you see a rate -- a negative rate impact as a result of that. And so as wholesale shipments start to pick up, you'll see less of an impact as you look towards the future. And then we also had 70 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter.
As we look ahead to next year, we do expect the market to remain promotional in the first half. And in Q4, we had about 250 basis points impact from, like, promotional activity across our own stores and our partners as we were investing to liquidate inventory across the marketplace. As we look to the first half of next year, we expect that the marketplace will continue to be promotional as we and our partners are moving through this inventory to achieve our goal. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see sequential improvement relative to what we delivered in Q4 as we move quarter-by-quarter through the first half.
I think you also asked about bad debt. So bad debt sits in SG&A, it doesn't sit in margin. And it was $180 million in the quarter. I think that's really more reflective of the wholesale marketplace, and our risk assessment of some of our wholesale customers and the impact that this pandemic has had on their ability to pay NIKE for receivables that we're owed. And so if you connect the dots to what John said in terms of our strategic acceleration, we do believe that there's going to be consolidation and dislocation in wholesale distribution in North America and in EMEA. And that's why we're taking a measured approach to growth in those geos as we look forward to next year."

Before I get into our Q1 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of John Thompson last month. Coach, as many of us called him, was a beloved member of the NIKE family, having served on our Board of Directors for over 30 years. He was a true leader and an icon in the world of sports, and we will miss him.
And here on the West Coast, we're continuing to deal with the wildfires that have hit Oregon, Washington and California. Health and safety remain our first priority so we closed facilities and stores where appropriate. For those teammates who have been impacted by evacuation orders, we've made additional benefits and support available, and the NIKE foundation has donated $1 million to provide relief efforts for the Oregon wildfires focusing on both intermediate- and longer-term needs.
Moving to our business results this quarter. We continue to demonstrate NIKE's full competitive advantage. Over the past several months, we've established clear objectives for our business, and we have been relentless in our focus on these objectives and the results are reflecting that. Our revenue trend is improving with Q1 flat to prior year on a constant-currency basis. Greater China, EMEA, Japan and South Korea have already returned to growth. More than the financial results is the continued strength of our brand, the response we're seeing from consumers and our unique position to be able to capitalize on our potential that excites me even more. We're getting stronger in the places that matter most. And even in the midst of disruption, we are on the offense. We have continued our unmatched pace of launching innovative product, generating a continuous flow of brand moments that connect with consumers and open groundbreaking retail concepts as we unlock significant long-term opportunity in a very dynamic environment.
We can navigate, in fact, we can thrive in this environment, thanks to our digital advantage and the full breadth of our global portfolio. Building on our foundational strengths, there are 3 structural tailwinds that play to NIKE's advantage: the accelerated consumer shift toward digital is here to stay; the definition of sport to include all facets of health, wellness and fitness; and it's the deeply connected authentic brands with scale that will win. NIKE's strength amid these evolving conditions help keep us in the lead. These advantages allow us to stay aggressive, and it's why I believe that no company is better positioned to emerge from this period than NIKE.
Over the past quarter, we continue to prove this out across 4 key areas. As always, it starts with product innovation. As I mentioned, our innovation pipeline and cadence has not slowed even during this uncertain environment. Second, our brand continues to deeply connect. Through the power of sport, we are creating hope and inspiration at a time when the world needs it. Third, we continue to take greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as the shift in consumer shopping preferences accelerates. And fourth, this digital focus is guiding how we create the future of retail as we continue to launch seamless premium brick-and-mortar experiences. Let me briefly touch on each of these 4 themes.
Our belief in innovation is embedded in everything we do. New innovation continues to resonate with our consumers with key innovation platforms becoming an even bigger part of our mix in Q1. We had many product highlights this quarter. Let's just take a look at a few. We continue to bring fresh points of view to our most beloved footwear, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and our deep lineup of Air Max. By continuously adding new styles, we expand these popular platforms. And we're also focused on fueling a constant cycle of new, scalable, distinct platforms. For instance, we reenergized the iconic Air Max 90 this year, and it was one of the quarter's top growth drivers.
We also pushed what's possible in sport as seen in the latest launch of our NIKE Next% footwear platform. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour barrier in a prototype of the Air Zoom AlphaFly Next%. And now that consumers have access to this innovation, we have heard from many that they're running their fastest times ever. This summer, we also released a training shoe, the Air Zoom Tempo Next%, bringing the measurable benefit of Next% to runners focused on pace and endurance. And we're continuing to execute on the incredible opportunity we see in women's apparel. In Q1, we launched Nike M, NIKE's first dedicated Maternity collection. We also introduced a new Nike Yoga collection that serves all genders and body types with performance fabric innovation that's the result of more than 2 years of development. The response to this best-in-class yoga collection has been amazing, and is already driving incredible growth for our women's yoga business. And last but not least, our sustainable footwear platform known as Space Hippie saw amazing sell through in our highest heat innovation launch ever. Coupled with the popularity we saw for VaporMax 2020 and we are seeing real consumer appetite for sustainability, especially with our youngest consumers. Sustainability will continue to be a key aspect of our Innovation agenda going forward.
This is how NIKE leads. Innovation is deeply ingrained in this company. And over the past 3 months, as most companies focused on just surviving, we are continuously bringing forward new compelling product to market. Our innovation pipeline demonstrates both our strength as well as our endurance. At NIKE, innovation is a systemic approach, and it's how we extend our lead.
Second, the power of the NIKE Brand continues to be felt all over the world. In all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand. In challenging times, we know how to drive meaningful connections with our consumers. You can see this in our market share gains across the NIKE and Jordan brands. Most notably are the pandemic, we've seen an acceleration of share gains in U.S., women's and apparel, 2 areas of strategic focus. And as always, we connect with consumers through the power of sport. We continue to see strong consumer engagement in the You Can't Stop Sport campaign, with over 2.6 billion impressions as we've reached more than 800 million unique consumers around the world. Our latest film celebrates sport as a source of inspiration. From Serena and Venus Williams, the You Can't Stop sisters to sport -- a spot, celebrating Kobe Bryant who continues to inspire athletes all over the world on and off the court. The consumer energy around this broader campaign is testimony to NIKE's brand appeal at a time when so much is going on in the world.
And at the same time, we create experiences and services that inspire and enable our members to keep pushing themselves further. In Q1, we saw an all-time high of the percentage of our members working out on the Nike Training Club app, with more than 50% of our members worldwide starting a workout in Q1. And in the Nike Running Club, we've seen 4 consecutive months of more than 1 million downloads each month of our audio-guided runs. For those that have missed the camaraderie group runs during the pandemic, runners are telling us, they're enjoying the connection and extra push offered by this feature. And in Q1, for the first time ever, women completed more of these runs than men.
We're also connecting to our purpose and values as our brand continues to be culturally embedded throughout the world of sport and beyond. Our athletes are doing the same. Just this month, you saw Naomi Osaka give voice to the Black Lives Matter movement by setting out the finals of the tournament just prior to the U.S. Open before returning to the U.S. Open and winning it. With leadership from global sports icons like Naomi and NBA players like LeBron and Janus as well as the thousands of others who have stood up and spoken out, our athletes are having a profound impact in our society. All in all, from the cultural resonance of our brand to our expansion of what sport can mean, Q1 was a quarter that showed our relentless focus on deepening connections with our consumers matters.
Third, I continue to be excited about the opportunity I see for NIKE and digital. We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back. Our NIKE Digital business is already meeting our [ mixed ] goal of 30%, nearly 3 years ahead of schedule, and we will continue to grow from here. This quarter, our owned digital channel grew 83% on a currency-neutral basis driving almost $900 million of incremental revenue versus the prior year and an acceleration versus the prior quarter, even as our doors at retail reopened. Our engagement and membership metrics show incredible momentum. For example, we're seeing almost 200% growth in demand for our i.e. commerce app, with triple-digit growth in monthly active users. This is significant for us as it speaks to the increasing consumer adoption of our apps. And while we've had tremendous success in digital, and quickly pivoted to the accelerated consumer shift, I truly believe that NIKE is just scratching the surface of what's possible. With our breadth and depth, no one has the advantage in this space that NIKE has to directly connect with consumers. NIKE's digital transformation strategy is not easily replicated. Simply put, scale matters. And NIKE leads, and we will continue to lead in this space for all the reasons I've already mentioned. Our size, our incredible product, our brand strength and Infinity, the direct consumer relationships we deepen each day and our ability to create seamless and differentiated shopping experiences. That is how we drive continued separation.
Now we know this is a multiyear journey, and we have a bright future and lots of opportunity, but in many ways, we're just getting started. To date, we've done some impressive things to achieve scale, highlighted by our app ecosystem, our RFID investment and our omnichannel distribution centers. And as part of the consumer direct acceleration, we have some clear immediate priorities, including scaling O2O, improving personalization and creating a consistent end-to-end technology platform. And of course, we remain focused on increasing member engagement to unlock value for both NIKE and our consumers. After all, we know a consumer who connects with us on 2 or more platforms has a lifetime value that's 4x higher than those who don't. And in particular, I'm focused on how we will leverage consumer data and insights in our digital ecosystem to understand and serve consumers better and ultimately increase our competitive advantage. We'll use data to stay a step ahead and help us create a better product as consumer insights power our business end-to-end towards even greater growth.
Fourth and finally, digital is fueling how we create the future of retail. This is the first quarter since the start of the pandemic where our retail was essentially opened. And as more consumers return to our stores, we saw impressive conversion in-store, even as our digital business accelerated even further. Our store traffic and sales are improving quarter-over-quarter, and we're also seeing consumers increasingly self identify as a member during checkout, or as we call it, a linked transaction, which is leading to even more engagement on our apps and an elevated O2O journey. This is our vision for the marketplace, a digitally connected experience where membership is a true differentiator.
And just as our continuous product pipeline, we continue to innovate in the retail space. We're accelerating the shift we discussed last quarter to One NIKE marketplace as part of our digital, CDA acceleration. As you recall, our One NIKE marketplace approach leads with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent and seamless consumer experience. In fact, during the quarter, we took focused actions to proactively shift the North America marketplace as part of our strategy to serve consumers more consistently and more personally. Simply put, we're on the offense and accelerating toward this future vision. And this is evidenced by our new and innovative retail concepts amplified by an elevated O2O consumer journey. Just in Q1, we launched new stores in Guangzhou, China, Seoul, Los Angeles and Paris with 2 new doors in New York City coming in the next few weeks. These stores range across many different formats, from our House of Innovation concept in Paris to a new Nike Factory Store in the Watts neighborhood of LA as we deepen our connection in key cities. And all these concepts are underpinned by digital.
I'll go a little deeper in one, just as an example. Our new store in Guangzhou is a data-powered store concept that curates a one-to-one personalized shopping journey. We're already seeing member checkout in our Guangzhou store significantly outpace the rest of the fleet. This is just one reflection of how digitally enabled our future of retail is and how membership is a critical differentiator.
Personally, one of the things I am most thrilled about is the return to organized sport. In fact, there was a day earlier this month when you could watch the NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, WNBA, NHL, tennis, U.S. Open, a golf tournament and about 6 different global football leagues all taking place within the same 24 hours. Though health and safety remain paramount, you can just feel the optimism and excitement of sport coming back. And as we look to the Tokyo Olympics next summer, NIKE remains in a unique position to serve our consumers and fuel their passion for sport.
And so as you can see, even during market uncertainty, we're not slowing down. NIKE is staying on the offense and looking to extend our leadership position. We have that ability. And as I've said before, these are times when the strong can get stronger, and I'm energized by our incredible potential.
And in closing, I want to thank our teammates all over the world who continue to innovate, execute and show tremendous resilience throughout a challenging year. I could not be more proud of them, and we can't wait to show you what we're going to do next. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."

And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned. Interest in activity and health, fitness and wellness has never been greater. Consumer connection and engagement with our brand is growing, and NIKE is transforming the way we operate to better serve all consumers. Looking forward, we believe that NIKE is stronger and now even better positioned to drive separation than prior to the pandemic.
As I reflect on the first quarter, there are 3 key strategic and financial themes that stand out. First, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by brand momentum and our relentless focus on execution; second, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity; and third, our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Let me take a few minutes to walk through each of these points.
First, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we implemented an enterprise-wide operational plan at the onset of the pandemic. Our teams have navigated with agility and focus to recalibrate supply and demand, to increase digital distribution capacity, to secure liquidity and to tightly manage costs, all while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and consumers. As a result, NIKE, Inc.'s first quarter reported revenue declined 1% versus prior year and was flat on a constant-currency basis, and reported EBIT grew 13% versus prior year. All a sharp acceleration from last quarter and exceeding our internal plans. There are a few elements that are important for me to highlight here. Despite ongoing uncertainty, more countries are emerging from containment and have returned to growth: China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France and Germany, just to name a few. Marketplace inventory is healthy and within our targeted guardrails. NIKE inventory levels have improved since May with Q1 inventory growing 15% versus prior year as compared to 31% growth in Q4, and is on track to be normalized in the next 60 days. We are reducing excess inventory at lower promotional levels relative to the overall marketplace, highlighting the strength of our brand and the value of our key product franchises. And we ended Q1 in a net cash position, generating positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity to over $13 billion. These financial results offer clear evidence of a faster marketplace recovery for NIKE, fueled by consumer demand for all our brands. Our momentum is building. And more importantly, our market share is accelerating around the world. We now expect reported revenue to be roughly flat versus prior year in the first half of fiscal '21.
This leads me to the second theme, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer while simultaneously accelerating productivity. As you have seen over the last 2 quarters, our priorities are clear: we will continue to both accelerate investment against our digital transformation and prudently manage our spending. At the same time, we are focused on amplifying our brand impact. Over the past 2 quarters, as we have seen demand for our digital business rapidly accelerate, we've invested to further increase digital fulfillment capacity and inventory visibility. Our new regional service center near Los Angeles went live this month, and uses predictive modeling to anticipate consumer demand and ensure the product our consumers want is available and will arrive within 1 to 2 days. We will achieve this level of service at a lower fulfillment cost over time. We scaled ship-from-store capabilities in North America's NIKE Brand inline stores, which now represents over 20% of revenue in enabled doors. These capabilities will be enhanced by our RFID investments, highlighting dramatic improvement we are making in our O2O service performance. We are scaling robotics and automation in our logistics operations, accelerating digital throughput and cutting order cycle times by up to 50%. Especially during times of heightened safety measures due to COVID-19, this allows our teams to serve higher levels of digital demand with greater efficiency and precision. We've already deployed this automation in North America, Japan and EMEA, and we'll continue to scale these critical improvements further as delivery becomes increasingly important in consumer-buying decisions. And while we double down on the strategic capability required to fuel our digital acceleration, we are simultaneously driving a sharper prioritization and sequencing of our investments. For example, we drove significant leverage in our demand creation spending versus prior year in the last 2 quarters, creating fewer but significantly more impactful brand campaigns. We were also able to increase the return on performance marketing investment, driving accelerated digital demand and greater digital engagement. The NIKE and Jordan brands are stronger than ever, delivering historic records of engagement through nearly 5 billion social media impressions just this quarter.
Another example is how our organizational restructuring will simplify the way we work, eliminate duplication and redundancy and realign our resources to focus on our biggest growth opportunities. While we will incur a nonrecurring charge to effect this plan in fiscal '21, this restructuring will also create a similar level of recurring annual cost savings that will help fuel the acceleration of our digital transformation. In this moment, the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate where and how we will invest. Ultimately, we will drive deeper consumer connections and continue to amplify our brand strength, using technology to operate more efficiently and at greater scale.
This brings me to my final theme. Our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our digital business grew 83% in Q1 on a currency-neutral basis. And as John mentioned, digital, across owned and partner, now represents over 30% of our total business, up more than 10 points of share versus the prior year. But more importantly, we saw tremendous momentum in the measures of success that matter most to create scale and drive long-term profitability. These include member engagement and owned digital market share. In Q1, NIKE active members increased nearly 60% with even higher growth in buying members. We also drove strong double-digit growth in contactable members. We saw owned digital market share gains across both the U.S. and key countries in EMEA, which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain and to grow our digital penetration even as physical retail traffic continues to recover. What's even more important though, is that we can see several strategic and financial benefits from accelerating our digital transformation. First, by leveraging data to enhance membership, personalization and consumer-oriented O2O services across the marketplace, we can drive greater inventory efficiency and unlock accelerated growth in key opportunities like women's and apparel. Second, in a normalized period, we earned roughly 10 points higher gross margin rate on our digital revenue versus wholesale. And while we will need to continue investments to expand digital fulfillment capacity, we can improve operational efficiency through predictive modeling tools, data-driven member personalization and inventory staging. And finally, we will manage digital transformation within our SG&A guardrails. As we accelerate the pace of investment, a technology foundation will enable us to unlock operating efficiency through automation and increased productivity across the organization. Further, as we grow digital engagement and we retain a higher proportion of engaged members with increased buying frequency, we will be lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing our return on ad spend and changing the shape of our demand creation investment. As John said earlier, we know that digital is the new normal. And as we drive continued separation in the market through a connected, seamless and modern consumer experiences, we will fuel growth and profitability.
Now let's turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q revenue declined 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 13% led by strong digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 versus the prior year as a result of impacts from COVID-19, including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs. These factors were offset slightly by favorable full price product margins and the reversal of certain reserves associated with purchase order cancellations due to higher-than-anticipated consumer demand.
SG&A declined 11% in Q1. We tightly managed operating expenses, including lower and more effective marketing spend as live sporting events slowly started to resume, while investing to support accelerating digital growth and transformation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5% compared to 12.4% for the same period last year primarily due to benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a reserve for a discrete tax matter. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.95, up 10% versus prior year.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Despite varied recovery curves and macroeconomic dynamics, our geographies have some key themes in common in Q1: first, strong digital growth and increasing member engagement; second, women's outperformance versus men's and a growing Jordan brand; and third, lower physical traffic in our NIKE-owned stores versus last year, although substantially improved versus the prior quarter. Traffic trends were partially offset by higher conversion rates and higher spend per transaction. 
In North America, specifically, Q1 revenue declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 18% on a reported basis. Digital was up nearly 100%, driven by triple-digit growth in full price sales and fueled by strong momentum in iconic styles like the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, along with women's apparel, which grew nearly 200% in the quarter. Demand on the Nike App grew 150% in Q1, highlighting the continued shift to mobile experiences. 
Finally, as we cut purchase orders to recalibrate supply and demand in North America during the first half of fiscal '21, we shifted product allocations to fuel higher demand in NIKE Digital and our smaller group of strategic wholesale partners. The result with high single-digit growth in differentiated wholesale, offset by a decline of over 20% in undifferentiated wholesale, all with a higher full price realization versus the prior year. This is a trend that we expect to continue throughout this fiscal year as we change the shape of the North America marketplace.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 14% on a reported basis. Recovery in Italy and Spain continues to lag recovery across the rest of Western Europe. NIKE Direct grew over 25% with over 100% digital growth, driven by lifestyle products as the consumer focus on comfort continues. Apparel in EMEA grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by the performance categories of running, training, basketball and global football, which featured our biggest club launch ever with Liverpool FC. EMEA also continues to lead globally with our Express Lane offense, maximizing supply availability and actively managing inventory while capturing emerging trends. Express Lane drove revenue growth and generated higher full price realization in the quarter.
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which continued its strong momentum with 8% growth on a currency-neutral basis, with Mainland China delivering double-digit growth. NIKE Direct grew over 20%, with more balanced channel growth as digital grew nearly 30% and NIKE-owned stores were up double digits fueled by key consumer moments like 618, where NIKE was the #1 sports brand on Tmall. NIKE sportswear and basketball drove double-digit growth in the quarter with strong sell through of key innovation launches, like the AlphaFly Next%, Space Hippie and the AJ 1 FlyEase. Retail sales in the China marketplace are accelerating with an increasing proportion of full price sales. Physical retail traffic continues to grow and is approaching prior year levels. And we are also well positioned for Singles Day in November.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q1 revenue declined 12% on a currency-neutral basis. Including digital growth, exceeded 90%. We continue to see varied impacts of COVID-19 across countries in the region, with growth in the Asia Pacific region being led by Japan, Pacific and South Korea, while recovery in Latin America and certain countries in Southeast Asia continues at a slower pace. Performance footwear resonated with consumers in APLA this quarter as we saw strong results from the AlphaFly Next% and the Pegasus 37. Jordan has also continued to excite the consumer with locally relevant product like the AJ 34, Rui Hachimura, which was Japan's best-selling basketball launch ever.
As I said last quarter, fiscal '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty because virus-containment patterns around the world remain volatile. Therefore, each market recovery will not be linear, and the comparisons with prior year will become increasingly less intuitive. We are focused on what we can control: deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this environment. We are tightly buying inventory, and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and our key product franchises.
With the first quarter now complete, I will update our full year financial outlook. Despite the continued uncertainties, we now expect revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits versus prior year. Stronger-than-anticipated demand for our brands will be constrained in the near term due to the supply decisions we took in the face of the pandemic, with growth in the second half to be up significantly versus prior year. Our gross margin outlook will continue to be a function of prioritizing a return to normalized inventory levels by the end of Q2. In the second half, we expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in full price sales, but we do expect a continuation of higher markdown activity in our factory stores to sustain conversion rates on lower traffic. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to be flat versus prior year, including 40 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect SG&A will be flat versus prior year, including approximately $200 million to $250 million of nonrecurring execution costs incurred in the first half associated with simplifying our organizational structure.
NIKE is poised to emerge from the current environment stronger and better positioned with a sharper focus, a clearer view of our brand's long-term future and with a team that is energized to compete and to win. At the same time, we are managing our business to deliver financial results that will set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in FY '22 and beyond. The future for NIKE is bright. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

So in the first quarter, our gross margin was down 90 basis points versus prior year. And obviously, that was a substantial improvement versus the results we had in the fourth quarter, really reflecting the strength of NIKE's market recovery. However, Q1 did benefit from about 55 basis points of onetime accrual reversals that we had incurred in Q4. The biggest of which related to factory PO cancellations, which we reinstated some supply due to the strong demand we were seeing in the quarter. So if you add that back, you get to a gross margin that's down roughly [ 145 ] basis points versus the prior year, and that's driven by markdown activity to work through and normalize our supply. As we look ahead to Q2, Bob, our margin will continue to be a function of supply and demand management because our top priority is to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And we expect Q2 will probably be more promotional than what we saw in Q1 because of holiday, the seasonal consumer moments like 11/11 in China, and then this year, we got Cyber Monday in Q2, whereas last year, it slipped into Q3. And we also are seeing, despite our strong performance, a lot of inventory still in the marketplace. And so that's how we're looking at the first half of the year.
As we look to the second half, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting sequential improvement with a higher mix of full price sales. And we'll start to see the benefits in our supply chain from exiting the extra storage that we needed for inventory in the first half. We also expect, though, that we're going to need to maintain an investment in discount in our factory stores because we're not anticipating traffic to recover to prior year levels in the balance of the year. And so we're assuming that there will continue to be some promotional activity in the second half of the year to maintain conversion rates and unit velocity as we keep -- as we continue to operate through the balance of the year. All in all, Bob, that just nets to about a flat versus prior year."

But yes, so it starts with where John was in his prepared remarks. We obviously believe that scale, for our digital business, is going to drive significant financial benefits as we continue to grow the size of that business and leverage the capabilities that we continue to develop. I think there's probably 3 key drivers of operating margin improvement that we see from leveraging scale of our digital business. The first one just relates to leveraging data and the data that we continue to gather as a growing business to create personalized product offerings for consumers. And the benefit that, that will drive is higher full price realization and less markdowns of product that we're selling digitally to consumers. The second piece is also kind of connected to data which is where do we place our inventory and how do we flow it so that we can be closer to the consumer and ultimately lower our fulfillment costs. And we believe that will continue to -- that will be a driver as well of continued gross margin expansion. And then the third piece kind of ties back to what I referenced on our performance marketing, investment and marketing. We have got to move deeper into the funnel, less new -- moving from attracting and acquiring new members to retaining members knowing those numbers and driving more engagement and frequency of purchase within our existing member base. And we believe that by running that offense, we will see more productivity in our demand creation spend and a higher return on our demand creation spend. And by doing that, we should be able to also drive additional operating margin expansion."

Does that continue? And does it cascade down to college, and high school and youth? I say my prayers every night, I hope so. I think the -- obviously, safety is paramount. And the more you get in a distributed environment, a less controlled environment, obviously, the more challenging that is. And so we completely embrace balancing safety but also return to sport. And I think the other part of -- this is not organized sport, what we're seeing is I think -- and I think these things are related. People are more engaged as sort of this movement toward health, and fitness and wellness which I think started when people being confined to their homes, we're seeing it continue to accelerate. You watch a game on TV and you want to go out for a run, right? You go shoot baskets in the driveway. And so  I think sport is so healthy for the world right now, and we're going to do everything we can. Including, by the way, some of the brand moments that we're trying to celebrate to reinforce. I just love the Venus and Serena spot. It just celebrates the power sport has in connecting with consumers. And so you hear the excitement in my voice.

And given where things are sitting in the pandemic at this point in time, we were able to leverage the inventory visibility in order to be able to take advantage of some of the -- take advantage of the demand that we had across the marketplace and across our retail stores. We now have 100% of our footwear, as I think we've told you before, and 75% of our apparel tagged. So we've got over 1 billion units at 99.99% readability which enables us to see our inventory now across all of our factory stores and they're live in our own doors. And they've helped to accelerate our O2O capabilities by providing a clear line of sight to the inventory levels. RFID is going to drive improved inventory holding costs, and it's also going to help us reduce our transportation costs, both in direct and in wholesale. And we believe that's going to be a critical enabler in order for us to create a fully connected marketplace for NIKE product across both our owned stores and our strategic partners."

And I must say, from a Board perspective, I saw the investment NIKE was making in digital. And boy, you see the result of that, the fact that we have a clear digital advantage today. That said, having had a technology background, I feel like there is so much opportunity remaining that we're still just scratching the surface of what's possible. And so in particular, the way we think about it is consumer-facing digital, right? Demand sensing, little things. This quarter, we turned on machine learning on search and a little bit of improvement drove greater conversion. By the way, that's continuous. So the ability to use AI and machine learning, digital demand sensing, insight gathering, digital marketing, membership personalization, even the inventory optimization, I think we're still got ample benefits, an ample opportunity in the consumer-facing side of things. And those are things like in technology, they're not big bangs. It's a whole series of continuous and ongoing improvement that, by the way, are very measurable and enhance growth or improve profitability. And then beyond that, or where I think we still have huge opportunities, we now have one integrated technology road map and we're applying that across our entire company end-to-end. And so whether it is the manufacturing through supply chain and the automation opportunities that  exists, whether it's using robotics or other ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness. Our whole product creation area. One of the people that is most excited about the opportunity to digitize is our Head of Design, John Hoke, and just how digital can really enhance not only the productivity but also the creativity of our designers. And so we now have a 3 -- a clear 3-year road map that to bring technology to every element of our operation and every element of our  end-to-end business. And the nice thing about that is in almost every case, you can define measurable benefits, whether it's enhanced growth, deeper connection with consumers or improved efficiency with automation and use of -- intelligent use of technology.

And we believe that this strategy will fuel growth and profitability in line with the long-term financial model that we have previously communicated. Obviously, there are a number of factors that are outstanding that may create disruption over periods of time as we look at it.

Before I get into our Q1 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of John Thompson last month. Coach, as many of us called him, was a beloved member of the NIKE family, having served on our Board of Directors for over 30 years. He was a true leader and an icon in the world of sports, and we will miss him. 
And here on the West Coast, we're continuing to deal with the wildfires that have hit Oregon, Washington and California. Health and safety remain our first priority so we closed facilities and stores where appropriate. For those teammates who have been impacted by evacuation orders, we've made additional benefits and support available, and the NIKE foundation has donated $1 million to provide relief efforts for the Oregon wildfires, focusing on both intermediate- and longer-term needs. 
Moving to our business results this quarter. We continue to demonstrate NIKE's full competitive advantage. Over the past several months, we've established clear objectives for our business, and we have been relentless in our focus on these objectives and the results are reflecting that. Our revenue trend is improving, with Q1 flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Greater China, EMEA, Japan and South Korea have already returned to growth. But more than the financial results, it's the continued strength of our brand, the response we're seeing from consumers and our unique position to be able to capitalize on our potential that excites me even more. We're getting stronger in the places that matter most. And even in the midst of disruption, we are on the offense. We have continued our unmatched pace of launching innovative product, generating a continuous flow of brand moments that connect with consumers and open groundbreaking retail concepts as we unlock significant long-term opportunity in a very dynamic environment. 
We can navigate, in fact, we can thrive in this environment, thanks to our digital advantage and the full breadth of our global portfolio. Building on our foundational strengths, there are 3 structural tailwinds that play to NIKE's advantage: the accelerated consumer shift toward digital is here to stay; the definition of sport to include all facets of health, wellness and fitness; and it's the deeply connected authentic brands with scale that will win. NIKE's strength amid these evolving conditions help keep us in the lead. These advantages allow us to stay aggressive, and it's why I believe that no company is better positioned to emerge from this period than NIKE. 
Over the past quarter, we continue to prove this out across 4 key areas. As always, it starts with product innovation. As I mentioned, our innovation pipeline and cadence has not slowed even during this uncertain environment. Second, our brand continues to deeply connect. Through the power of sport, we are creating hope and inspiration at a time when the world needs it. Third, we continue to take greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as the shift in consumer shopping preferences accelerates. And fourth, this digital focus is guiding how we create the future of retail as we continue to launch seamless premium brick-and-mortar experiences. Let me briefly touch on each of these 4 themes. 
Our belief in innovation is embedded in everything we do. New innovation continues to resonate with our consumers, with key innovation platforms becoming an even bigger part of our mix in Q1. We had many product highlights this quarter. Let's just take a look at a few. We continue to bring fresh points of view to our most beloved footwear, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and our deep lineup of Air Max. By continuously adding new styles, we expand these popular platforms. And we're also focused on fueling a constant cycle of new, scalable, distinct platforms. For instance, we reenergized the iconic Air Max 90 this year, and it was one of the quarter's top growth drivers. 
We also pushed what's possible in sport as seen in the latest launch of our NIKE NEXT% footwear platform. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour barrier in a prototype of the Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%. And now that consumers have access to this innovation, we have heard from many that they're running their fastest times ever. This summer, we also released a training shoe, the Air Zoom Tempo NEXT%, bringing the measurable benefit of NEXT% to runners focused on pace and endurance. And we're continuing to execute on the incredible opportunity we see in women's apparel. In Q1, we launched Nike (M), NIKE's first dedicated maternity collection. 
We also introduced a new NIKE yoga collection that serves all genders and body types with performance fabric innovation that's the result of more than 2 years of development. The response to this best-in-class yoga collection has been amazing and is already driving incredible growth for our women's yoga business. And last but not least, our sustainable footwear platform known as Space Hippie saw amazing sell-through in our highest heat innovation launch ever. Coupled with the popularity we saw for VaporMax 2020, we are seeing real consumer appetite for sustainability, especially with our youngest consumers. Sustainability will continue to be a key aspect of our innovation agenda going forward. 
This is how NIKE leads. Innovation is deeply ingrained in this company. And over the past 3 months, as most companies focused on just surviving, we are continuously bringing forward new compelling product to market. Our innovation pipeline demonstrates both our strength as well as our endurance. At NIKE, innovation is a systemic approach, and it's how we extend our lead. 
Second, the power of the NIKE Brand continues to be felt all over the world. In all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand. In challenging times, we know how to drive meaningful connections with our consumers. You can see this in our market share gains across the NIKE and Jordan brands. Most notably, during the pandemic, we've seen an acceleration of share gains in U.S. women's and apparel, 2 areas of strategic focus. And as always, we connect with consumers through the power of sport. We continue to see strong consumer engagement in the You Can't Stop Sport campaign, with over 2.6 billion impressions as we've reached more than 800 million unique consumers around the world. Our latest films celebrate sport as a source of inspiration. From Serena and Venus Williams in You Can't Stop Sisters to a sport -- a spot celebrating Kobe Bryant, who continues to inspire athletes all over the world, on and off the court. The consumer energy around this broader campaign is testimony to NIKE's brand appeal at a time when so much is going on in the world. 
And at the same time, we create experiences and services that inspire and enable our members to keep pushing themselves further. In Q1, we saw an all-time high of the percentage of our members working out on the Nike Training Club app, with more than 50% of our members worldwide starting a workout in Q1. And in the Nike Running Club, we've seen 4 consecutive months of more than 1 million downloads each month of our audio-guided runs. For those that have missed the camaraderie group runs during the pandemic, runners are telling us they're enjoying the connection and extra push offered by this feature. And in Q1, for the first time ever, women completed more of these runs than men. 
We're also connecting to our purpose and values as our brand continues to be culturally embedded throughout the world of sport and beyond. Our athletes are doing the same. Just this month, you saw Naomi Osaka give voice to the Black Lives Matter movement by setting out the finals of the tournament just prior to the U.S. Open before returning to the U.S. Open and winning it. With leadership from global sports icons like Naomi and NBA players like LeBron and Giannis as well as the thousands of others who have stood up and spoken out, our athletes are having a profound impact in our society. All in all, from the cultural resonance of our brand to our expansion of what sport can mean, Q1 was a quarter that showed our relentless focus on deepening connections with our consumers matters.
Third, I continue to be excited about the opportunity I see for NIKE in digital. We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back. Our NIKE Digital business is already meeting our mixed goal of 30%, nearly 3 years ahead of schedule, and we will continue to grow from here. This quarter, our owned digital channel grew 83% on a currency-neutral basis, driving almost $900 million of incremental revenue versus the prior year and an acceleration versus the prior quarter, even as our doors at retail reopened. 
Our engagement and membership metrics show incredible momentum. For example, we're seeing almost 200% growth in demand for our NIKE commerce app, with triple-digit growth in monthly active users. This is significant for us as it speaks to the increasing consumer adoption of our apps. And while we've had tremendous success in digital and quickly pivoted to the accelerated consumer shift, I truly believe that NIKE is just scratching the surface of what's possible. With our breadth and depth, no one has the advantage in this space that NIKE has to directly connect with consumers. NIKE's digital transformation strategy is not easily replicated. Simply put, scale matters. And NIKE leads, and we will continue to lead in this space for all the reasons I've already mentioned. Our size, our incredible product, our brand strength and affinity, the direct consumer relationships we deepen each day and our ability to create seamless and differentiated shopping experiences, that is how we drive continued separation.
Now we know this is a multiyear journey, and we have a bright future and lots of opportunity, but in many ways, we're just getting started. To date, we've done some impressive things to achieve scale, highlighted by our app ecosystem, our RFID investment and our omnichannel distribution centers. And as part of the consumer direct acceleration, we have some clear immediate priorities, including scaling O2O, improving personalization and creating a consistent end-to-end technology platform. And of course, we remain focused on increasing member engagement to unlock value for both NIKE and our consumers. After all, we know a consumer who connects with us on 2 or more platforms has a lifetime value that's 4x higher than those who don't. And in particular, I'm focused on how we will leverage consumer data and insights in our digital ecosystem to understand and serve consumers better and ultimately increase our competitive advantage. We'll use data to stay a step ahead and help us create a better product as consumer insights power our business end-to-end towards even greater growth.
Fourth and finally, digital is fueling how we create the future of retail. This is the first quarter since the start of the pandemic where our retail was essentially opened. And as more consumers return to our stores, we saw impressive conversion in-store, even as our digital business accelerated even further. Our store traffic and sales are improving quarter-over-quarter, and we're also seeing consumers increasingly self-identify as a member during checkout, or as we call it, a linked transaction, which is leading to even more engagement on our apps and an elevated O2O journey. This is our vision for the marketplace, a digitally connected experience where membership is a true differentiator.
And just as our continuous product pipeline, we continue to innovate in the retail space. We're accelerating the shift we discussed last quarter to One NIKE marketplace as part of our digital, CDA acceleration. As you recall, our One NIKE marketplace approach leads with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent and seamless consumer experience. In fact, during the quarter, we took focused actions to proactively shift the North America marketplace as part of our strategy to serve consumers more consistently and more personally. Simply put, we're on the offense and accelerating toward this future vision. And this is evidenced by our new and innovative retail concepts, amplified by an elevated O2O consumer journey. Just in Q1, we launched new stores in Guangzhou, China; Seoul; Los Angeles; and Paris; with 2 new doors in New York City coming in the next few weeks. These stores range across many different formats, from our House of Innovation concept in Paris to a new Nike Factory Store in the Watts neighborhood of LA as we deepen our connection in key cities. And all these concepts are underpinned by digital.
I'll go a little deeper in one just as an example. Our new store in Guangzhou is a data-powered store concept that curates a one-to-one personalized shopping journey. We're already seeing member checkout in our Guangzhou store significantly outpace the rest of the fleet. This is just one reflection of how digitally enabled our future of retail is and how membership is a critical differentiator.
Personally, one of the things I am most thrilled about is the return to organized sport. In fact, there was a day earlier this month when you could watch the NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, WNBA, NHL, tennis, U.S. Open, a golf tournament and about 6 different global football leagues, all taking place within the same 24 hours. Though health and safety remain paramount, you can just feel the optimism and excitement of sport coming back. And as we look to the Tokyo Olympics next summer, NIKE remains in a unique position to serve our consumers and fuel their passion for sport.
And so as you can see, even during market uncertainty, we're not slowing down. NIKE is staying on the offense and looking to extend our leadership position. We have that ability. And as I've said before, these are times when the strong can get stronger, and I'm energized by our incredible potential.
And in closing, I want to thank our teammates all over the world who continue to innovate, execute and show tremendous resilience throughout a challenging year. I could not be more proud of them, and we can't wait to show you what we're going to do next. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
291981,685670129,2102536,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2020",2020-09-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE entered the pandemic with unparalleled brand and business momentum. And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned.

And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned. Interest and activity in health, fitness and wellness has never been greater. Consumer connection and engagement with our brand is growing, and NIKE is transforming the way we operate to better serve all consumers. Looking forward, we believe that NIKE is stronger and now even better positioned to drive separation than prior to the pandemic.
As I reflect on the first quarter, there are 3 key strategic and financial themes that stand out: first, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by brand momentum and our relentless focus on execution; second, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity; and third, our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Let me take a few minutes to walk through each of these points.
First, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we implemented an enterprise-wide operational plan at the onset of the pandemic. Our teams have navigated with agility and focus to recalibrate supply and demand, to increase digital distribution capacity, to secure liquidity and to tightly manage costs, all while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and consumers. As a result, NIKE, Inc.'s first quarter reported revenue declined 1% versus prior year and was flat on a constant currency basis, and reported EBIT grew 13% versus prior year, all a sharp acceleration from last quarter and exceeding our internal plans. 
There are a few elements that are important for me to highlight here. Despite ongoing uncertainty, more countries are emerging from containment and have returned to growth: China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France and Germany, just to name a few. Marketplace inventory is healthy and within our targeted guardrails. NIKE inventory levels have improved since May, with Q1 inventory growing 15% versus prior year as compared to 31% growth in Q4, and is on track to be normalized in the next 60 days. We are reducing excess inventory at lower promotional levels relative to the overall marketplace, highlighting the strength of our brand and the value of our key product franchises. And we ended Q1 in a net cash position, generating positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity to over $13 billion. 
These financial results offer clear evidence of a faster marketplace recovery for NIKE, fueled by consumer demand for all our brands. Our momentum is building. And more importantly, our market share is accelerating around the world. We now expect reported revenue to be roughly flat versus prior year in the first half of fiscal '21.
This leads me to the second theme, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer while simultaneously accelerating productivity. As you have seen over the last 2 quarters, our priorities are clear: we will continue to both accelerate investment against our digital transformation and prudently manage other spending. At the same time, we are focused on amplifying our brand impact. 
Over the past 2 quarters, as we have seen demand for our digital business rapidly accelerate, we've invested to further increase digital fulfillment capacity and inventory visibility. Our new regional service center near Los Angeles went live this month and uses predictive modeling to anticipate consumer demand and ensure the product our consumers want is available and will arrive within 1 to 2 days. We will achieve this level of service at a lower fulfillment cost over time. We scaled ship-from-store capabilities in North America's NIKE Brand inline stores, which now represents over 20% of revenue in enabled doors. These capabilities will be enhanced by our RFID investments, highlighting dramatic improvement we are making in our O2O service performance. 
We are scaling robotics and automation in our logistics operations, accelerating digital throughput and cutting order cycle times by up to 50%. Especially during times of heightened safety measures due to COVID-19, this allows our teams to serve higher levels of digital demand with greater efficiency and precision. We've already deployed this automation in North America, Japan and EMEA, and we'll continue to scale these critical improvements further as delivery becomes increasingly important in consumer buying decisions. 
And while we double down on the strategic capability required to fuel our digital acceleration, we are simultaneously driving a sharper prioritization and sequencing of our investments. For example, we drove significant leverage in our demand creation spending versus prior year in the last 2 quarters, creating fewer but significantly more impactful brand campaigns. We were also able to increase the return on performance marketing investment, driving accelerated digital demand and greater digital engagement. The NIKE and Jordan brands are stronger than ever, delivering historic records of engagement through nearly 5 billion social media impressions just this quarter.
Another example is how our organizational restructuring will simplify the way we work, eliminate duplication and redundancy and realign our resources to focus on our biggest growth opportunities. While we will incur a nonrecurring charge to effect this plan in fiscal '21, this restructuring will also create a similar level of recurring annual cost savings that will help fuel the acceleration of our digital transformation. In this moment, the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate where and how we will invest. Ultimately, we will drive deeper consumer connections and continue to amplify our brand strength, using technology to operate more efficiently and at greater scale.
This brings me to my final theme. Our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our digital business grew 83% in Q1 on a currency-neutral basis. And as John mentioned, digital, across owned and partner, now represents over 30% of our total business, up more than 10 points of share versus the prior year. But more importantly, we saw tremendous momentum in the measures of success that matter most to create scale and drive long-term profitability. These include member engagement and owned digital market share. In Q1, NIKE active members increased nearly 60%, with even higher growth in buying members. We also drove strong double-digit growth in contactable members. We saw owned digital market share gains across both the U.S. and key countries in EMEA, which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain and to grow our digital penetration even as physical retail traffic continues to recover. 
What's even more important though is that we can see several strategic and financial benefits from accelerating our digital transformation. First, by leveraging data to enhance membership, personalization and consumer-oriented O2O services across the marketplace, we can drive greater inventory efficiency and unlock accelerated growth in key opportunities like women's and apparel. Second, in a normalized period, we earned roughly 10 points higher gross margin rate on our digital revenue versus wholesale. And while we will need to continue investments to expand digital fulfillment capacity, we can improve operational efficiency through predictive modeling tools, data-driven member personalization and inventory staging. And finally, we will manage digital transformation within our SG&A guardrails. 
As we accelerate the pace of investment, a technology foundation will enable us to unlock operating efficiency through automation and increased productivity across the organization. Further, as we grow digital engagement and we retain a higher proportion of engaged members with increased buying frequency, we will be lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing our return on ad spend and changing the shape of our demand creation investment. As John said earlier, we know that digital is the new normal. And as we drive continued separation in the market through connected, seamless and modern consumer experiences, we will fuel growth and profitability.
Now let's turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q revenue declined 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 13%, led by strong digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 versus the prior year as a result of impacts from COVID-19, including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs. These factors were offset slightly by favorable full price product margins and the reversal of certain reserves associated with purchase order cancellations due to higher-than-anticipated consumer demand.
SG&A declined 11% in Q1. We tightly managed operating expenses, including lower and more effective marketing spend as live sporting events slowly started to resume, while investing to support accelerating digital growth and transformation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5% compared to 12.4% for the same period last year, primarily due to benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a reserve for a discrete tax matter. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.95, up 10% versus prior year.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Despite varied recovery curves and macroeconomic dynamics, our geographies have some key themes in common in Q1: first, strong digital growth and increasing member engagement; second, women's outperformance versus men's and a growing Jordan brand; and third, lower physical traffic in our NIKE-owned stores versus last year, although substantially improved versus the prior quarter. Traffic trends were partially offset by higher conversion rates and higher spend per transaction. 
In North America, specifically, Q1 revenue declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT increased 18% on a reported basis. Digital was up nearly 100%, driven by triple-digit growth in full price sales and fueled by strong momentum in iconic styles like the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, along with women's apparel, which grew nearly 200% in the quarter. Demand on the Nike App grew 150% in Q1, highlighting the continued shift to mobile experiences. 
Finally, as we cut purchase orders to recalibrate supply and demand in North America during the first half of fiscal '21, we shifted product allocations to fuel higher demand in NIKE Digital and our smaller group of strategic wholesale partners. The result was high single-digit growth in differentiated wholesale, offset by a decline of over 20% in undifferentiated wholesale, all with a higher full price realization versus the prior year. This is a trend that we expect to continue throughout this fiscal year as we change the shape of the North America marketplace.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 14% on a reported basis. Recovery in Italy and Spain continues to lag recovery across the rest of Western Europe. NIKE Direct grew over 25% with over 100% digital growth, driven by lifestyle products as the consumer focus on comfort continues. Apparel in EMEA grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by the performance categories of running, training, basketball and global football, which featured our biggest club launch ever with Liverpool F.C. EMEA also continues to lead globally with our Express Lane offense, maximizing supply availability and actively managing inventory while capturing emerging trends. Express Lane drove revenue growth and generated higher full price realization in the quarter.
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which continued its strong momentum with 8% growth on a currency-neutral basis, with Mainland China delivering double-digit growth. NIKE Direct grew over 20%, with more balanced channel growth as digital grew nearly 30% and NIKE-owned stores were up double digits, fueled by key consumer moments like 618, where NIKE was the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Nike Sportswear and Basketball drove double-digit growth in the quarter with strong sell-through of key innovation launches like the Alphafly NEXT%, Space Hippie and the AJ1 FlyEase. Retail sales in the China marketplace are accelerating with an increasing proportion of full price sales. Physical retail traffic continues to grow and is approaching prior year levels. And we are also well positioned for Singles' Day in November.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q1 revenue declined 12% on a currency-neutral basis, including digital growth that exceeded 90%. We continue to see varied impacts of COVID-19 across countries in the region, with growth in the Asia Pacific region being led by Japan, Pacific and South Korea, while recovery in Latin America and certain countries in Southeast Asia continues at a slower pace. Performance footwear resonated with consumers in APLA this quarter as we saw strong results from the Alphafly NEXT% and the Pegasus 37. Jordan has also continued to excite the consumer with locally relevant product like the AJ34 Rui Hachimura, which was Japan's best-selling basketball launch ever.
As I said last quarter, fiscal '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty because virus-containment patterns around the world remain volatile. Therefore, each market recovery will not be linear, and the comparisons with prior year will become increasingly less intuitive. We are focused on what we can control: deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and our key product franchises.
With the first quarter now complete, I will update our full year financial outlook. Despite the continued uncertainties, we now expect revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits versus prior year. Stronger-than-anticipated demand for our brands will be constrained in the near term due to the supply decisions we took in the face of the pandemic, with growth in the second half to be up significantly versus prior year. Our gross margin outlook will continue to be a function of prioritizing a return to normalized inventory levels by the end of Q2. In the second half, we expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in full price sales, but we do expect a continuation of higher markdown activity in our factory stores to sustain conversion rates on lower traffic. 
For the full year, we now expect gross margin to be flat versus prior year, including 40 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect SG&A will be flat versus prior year, including approximately $200 million to $250 million of nonrecurring execution costs incurred in the first half associated with simplifying our organizational structure.
NIKE is poised to emerge from the current environment stronger and better positioned with a sharper focus, a clearer view of our brand's long-term future and with a team that is energized to compete and to win. At the same time, we are managing our business to deliver financial results that will set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in FY '22 and beyond. The future for NIKE is bright. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

So in the first quarter, our gross margin was down 90 basis points versus prior year. And obviously, that was a substantial improvement versus the results we had in the fourth quarter, really reflecting the strength of NIKE's market recovery. However, Q1 did benefit from about 55 basis points of onetime accrual reversals that we had incurred in Q4. The biggest of which related to factory PO cancellations, which we reinstated some supply due to the strong demand we were seeing in the quarter. So if you add that back, you get to a gross margin that's down roughly 145 basis points versus the prior year, and that's driven by markdown activity to work through and normalize our supply. 
As we look ahead to Q2, Bob, our margin will continue to be a function of supply and demand management because our top priority is to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And we expect Q2 will probably be more promotional than what we saw in Q1 because of holiday, the seasonal consumer moments like 11/11 in China, and then this year, we got Cyber Monday in Q2, whereas last year, it slipped into Q3. And we also are seeing, despite our strong performance, a lot of inventory still in the marketplace. And so that's how we're looking at the first half of the year.
As we look to the second half, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting sequential improvement with a higher mix of full price sales. And we'll start to see the benefits in our supply chain from exiting the extra storage that we needed for inventory in the first half. We also expect, though, that we're going to need to maintain an investment in discount in our factory stores because we're not anticipating traffic to recover to prior year levels in the balance of the year. And so we're assuming that there will continue to be some promotional activity in the second half of the year to maintain conversion rates and unit velocity as we keep -- as we continue to operate through the balance of the year. All in all, Bob, that just nets to about a flat versus prior year."

But yes, so it starts with where John was in his prepared remarks. We obviously believe that scale for our digital business is going to drive significant financial benefits as we continue to grow the size of that business and leverage the capabilities that we continue to develop. 
I think there's probably 3 key drivers of operating margin improvement that we see from leveraging scale of our digital business. The first one just relates to leveraging data and the data that we continue to gather as a growing business to create personalized product offerings for consumers. And the benefit that, that will drive is higher full price realization and less markdowns of product that we're selling digitally to consumers. 
The second piece is also kind of connected to data which is where do we place our inventory and how do we flow it so that we can be closer to the consumer and ultimately lower our fulfillment costs. And we believe that will continue to -- that will be a driver as well of continued gross margin expansion. 
And then the third piece kind of ties back to what I referenced on our performance marketing, investment and marketing. We have got to move deeper into the funnel, less new -- moving from attracting and acquiring new members to retaining members, knowing those members and driving more engagement and frequency of purchase within our existing member base. And we believe that by running that offense, we will see more productivity in our demand creation spend and a higher return on our demand creation spend. And by doing that, we should be able to also drive additional operating margin expansion."

Does that continue? And does it cascade down to college and high school and youth? I say my prayers every night, I hope so. I think the -- obviously, safety is paramount. And the more you get in a distributed environment, a less controlled environment, obviously, the more challenging that is. And so we completely embrace balancing safety but also return to sport. And I think the other part of -- this is not organized sport, what we're seeing is I think -- and I think these things are related. People are more engaged, sort of this movement toward health and fitness and wellness, which I think started when people being confined to their homes, we're seeing it continue to accelerate. You watch a game on TV, you want to go out for a run, right? You go shoot baskets in the driveway.

And I must say, from a Board perspective, I saw the investment NIKE was making in digital. And boy, you see the result of that, the fact that we have a clear digital advantage today. That said, having had a technology background, I feel like there is so much opportunity remaining that we're still just scratching the surface of what's possible. And so in particular, the way we think about it is consumer-facing digital, right? Demand sensing, little things. This quarter, we turned on machine learning on search, and a little bit of improvement drove greater conversion. By the way, that's continuous. So the ability to use AI and machine learning, digital demand sensing, insight gathering, digital marketing, membership personalization, even the inventory optimization, I think we still got ample benefits and ample opportunity in the consumer-facing side of things. And those are things like in technology, they're not big bangs. It's a whole series of continuous and ongoing improvement that, by the way, are very measurable and enhance growth or improve profitability. 
And then beyond that, where I think we still have huge opportunities, we now have one integrated technology road map. And we're applying that across our entire company end-to-end, and so whether it is the manufacturing through supply chain and the automation opportunities that exists, whether it's using robotics or other ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, our whole product creation area. One of the people that is most excited about the opportunity to digitize is our Head of Design, John Hoke, and just how digital can really enhance not only the productivity but also the creativity of our designers. And so we now have a 3 -- a clear 3-year road map that -- to bring technology to every element of our operation and every element of our end-to-end business. And the nice thing about that is in almost every case, you can define measurable benefits, whether it's enhanced growth, deeper connection with consumers or improved efficiency with automation and use of -- intelligent use of technology. So I think all of us view this as a real opportunity."

Our goals and our principles related to how we financially manage the business are really unchanged to deliver sustainable, profitable and capital-efficient growth over time. Obviously, right now, we're in the middle of quite an uncertain moment and pandemic. And while we are sharing with you our perspectives on the opportunities that we see as we look towards the future, the reality is that this environment right now is quite uncertain. And so what we're going to be focused on over the next 90 to 120 days is continuing to clean our inventory, continuing to create those consumer connections like we have been talking about and really focus on our One NIKE marketplace strategy, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on the opportunities that we see for NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. And we believe that this strategy will fuel growth and profitability in line with the long-term financial model that we have previously communicated. 
Obviously, there are a number of factors that are outstanding that may create disruption over periods of time as we look at it. And the most obvious one right now is just the pandemic and the impact it has on consumer demand and consumption in the near term. And so we're continuing to focus on the strategy and the shift because we think it's the right thing to do long term. And that's where our focus and attention is going to be at this time. We're investing and building this business for the long term, and that's where our focus is."

Before I get into our Q1 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of John Thompson last month. Coach, as many of us called him, was a beloved member of the NIKE family, having served on our Board of Directors for over 30 years. He was a true leader and an icon in the world of sports, and we will miss him.
And here on the West Coast, we're continuing to deal with the wildfires that have hit Oregon, Washington and California. Health and safety remain our first priority so we closed facilities and stores where appropriate. For those teammates who have been impacted by evacuation orders, we've made additional benefits and support available, and the NIKE foundation has donated $1 million to provide relief efforts for the Oregon wildfires, focusing on both intermediate- and longer-term needs.
Moving to our business results this quarter. We continue to demonstrate NIKE's full competitive advantage. Over the past several months, we've established clear objectives for our business, and we have been relentless in our focus on these objectives and the results are reflecting that. Our revenue trend is improving, with Q1 flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Greater China, EMEA, Japan and South Korea have already returned to growth. But more than the financial results, it's the continued strength of our brand, the response we're seeing from consumers and our unique position to be able to capitalize on our potential that excites me even more. We're getting stronger in the places that matter most. And even in the midst of disruption, we are on the offense. We have continued our unmatched pace of launching innovative product, generating a continuous flow of brand moments that connect with consumers and open groundbreaking retail concepts as we unlock significant long-term opportunity in a very dynamic environment.
We can navigate, in fact, we can thrive in this environment, thanks to our digital advantage and the full breadth of our global portfolio. Building on our foundational strengths, there are 3 structural tailwinds that play to NIKE's advantage: the accelerated consumer shift toward digital is here to stay; the definition of sport to include all facets of health, wellness and fitness; and it's the deeply connected authentic brands with scale that will win. NIKE's strength amid these evolving conditions help keep us in the lead. These advantages allow us to stay aggressive, and it's why I believe that no company is better positioned to emerge from this period than NIKE.
Over the past quarter, we continue to prove this out across 4 key areas. As always, it starts with product innovation. As I mentioned, our innovation pipeline and cadence has not slowed even during this uncertain environment. Second, our brand continues to deeply connect. Through the power of sport, we are creating hope and inspiration at a time when the world needs it. Third, we continue to take greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as the shift in consumer shopping preferences accelerates. And fourth, this digital focus is guiding how we create the future of retail as we continue to launch seamless premium brick-and-mortar experiences. Let me briefly touch on each of these 4 themes.
Our belief in innovation is embedded in everything we do. New innovation continues to resonate with our consumers, with key innovation platforms becoming an even bigger part of our mix in Q1. We had many product highlights this quarter. Let's just take a look at a few. We continue to bring fresh points of view to our most beloved footwear, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and our deep lineup of Air Max. By continuously adding new styles, we expand these popular platforms. And we're also focused on fueling a constant cycle of new, scalable, distinct platforms. For instance, we reenergized the iconic Air Max 90 this year, and it was one of the quarter's top growth drivers.
We also pushed what's possible in sport as seen in the latest launch of our NIKE NEXT% footwear platform. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour barrier in a prototype of the Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%. And now that consumers have access to this innovation, we have heard from many that they're running their fastest times ever. This summer, we also released a training shoe, the Air Zoom Tempo NEXT%, bringing the measurable benefit of NEXT% to runners focused on pace and endurance. And we're continuing to execute on the incredible opportunity we see in women's apparel. In Q1, we launched Nike (M), NIKE's first dedicated maternity collection.
We also introduced a new NIKE yoga collection that serves all genders and body types with performance fabric innovation that's the result of more than 2 years of development. The response to this best-in-class yoga collection has been amazing and is already driving incredible growth for our women's yoga business. And last but not least, our sustainable footwear platform known as Space Hippie saw amazing sell-through in our highest heat innovation launch ever. Coupled with the popularity we saw for VaporMax 2020, we are seeing real consumer appetite for sustainability, especially with our youngest consumers. Sustainability will continue to be a key aspect of our innovation agenda going forward.
This is how NIKE leads. Innovation is deeply ingrained in this company. And over the past 3 months, as most companies focused on just surviving, we are continuously bringing forward new compelling product to market. Our innovation pipeline demonstrates both our strength as well as our endurance. At NIKE, innovation is a systemic approach, and it's how we extend our lead.
Second, the power of the NIKE Brand continues to be felt all over the world. In all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand. In challenging times, we know how to drive meaningful connections with our consumers. You can see this in our market share gains across the NIKE and Jordan brands. Most notably, during the pandemic, we've seen an acceleration of share gains in U.S. women's and apparel, 2 areas of strategic focus. And as always, we connect with consumers through the power of sport. We continue to see strong consumer engagement in the You Can't Stop Sport campaign, with over 2.6 billion impressions as we've reached more than 800 million unique consumers around the world. Our latest films celebrate sport as a source of inspiration. From Serena and Venus Williams in You Can't Stop Sisters to a sport -- a spot celebrating Kobe Bryant, who continues to inspire athletes all over the world, on and off the court. The consumer energy around this broader campaign is testimony to NIKE's brand appeal at a time when so much is going on in the world.
And at the same time, we create experiences and services that inspire and enable our members to keep pushing themselves further. In Q1, we saw an all-time high of the percentage of our members working out on the Nike Training Club app, with more than 50% of our members worldwide starting a workout in Q1. And in the Nike Running Club, we've seen 4 consecutive months of more than 1 million downloads each month of our audio-guided runs. For those that have missed the camaraderie group runs during the pandemic, runners are telling us they're enjoying the connection and extra push offered by this feature. And in Q1, for the first time ever, women completed more of these runs than men.
We're also connecting to our purpose and values as our brand continues to be culturally embedded throughout the world of sport and beyond. Our athletes are doing the same. Just this month, you saw Naomi Osaka give voice to the Black Lives Matter movement by setting out the finals of the tournament just prior to the U.S. Open before returning to the U.S. Open and winning it. With leadership from global sports icons like Naomi and NBA players like LeBron and Giannis as well as the thousands of others who have stood up and spoken out, our athletes are having a profound impact in our society. All in all, from the cultural resonance of our brand to our expansion of what sport can mean, Q1 was a quarter that showed our relentless focus on deepening connections with our consumers matters.
Third, I continue to be excited about the opportunity I see for NIKE in digital. We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back. Our NIKE Digital business is already meeting our mixed goal of 30%, nearly 3 years ahead of schedule, and we will continue to grow from here. This quarter, our owned digital channel grew 83% on a currency-neutral basis, driving almost $900 million of incremental revenue versus the prior year and an acceleration versus the prior quarter, even as our doors at retail reopened.
Our engagement and membership metrics show incredible momentum. For example, we're seeing almost 200% growth in demand for our NIKE commerce app, with triple-digit growth in monthly active users. This is significant for us as it speaks to the increasing consumer adoption of our apps. And while we've had tremendous success in digital and quickly pivoted to the accelerated consumer shift, I truly believe that NIKE is just scratching the surface of what's possible. With our breadth and depth, no one has the advantage in this space that NIKE has to directly connect with consumers. NIKE's digital transformation strategy is not easily replicated. Simply put, scale matters. And NIKE leads, and we will continue to lead in this space for all the reasons I've already mentioned. Our size, our incredible product, our brand strength and affinity, the direct consumer relationships we deepen each day and our ability to create seamless and differentiated shopping experiences, that is how we drive continued separation.
Now we know this is a multiyear journey, and we have a bright future and lots of opportunity, but in many ways, we're just getting started. To date, we've done some impressive things to achieve scale, highlighted by our app ecosystem, our RFID investment and our omnichannel distribution centers. And as part of the consumer direct acceleration, we have some clear immediate priorities, including scaling O2O, improving personalization and creating a consistent end-to-end technology platform. And of course, we remain focused on increasing member engagement to unlock value for both NIKE and our consumers. After all, we know a consumer who connects with us on 2 or more platforms has a lifetime value that's 4x higher than those who don't. And in particular, I'm focused on how we will leverage consumer data and insights in our digital ecosystem to understand and serve consumers better and ultimately increase our competitive advantage. We'll use data to stay a step ahead and help us create a better product as consumer insights power our business end-to-end towards even greater growth.
Fourth and finally, digital is fueling how we create the future of retail. This is the first quarter since the start of the pandemic where our retail was essentially opened. And as more consumers return to our stores, we saw impressive conversion in-store, even as our digital business accelerated even further. Our store traffic and sales are improving quarter-over-quarter, and we're also seeing consumers increasingly self-identify as a member during checkout, or as we call it, a linked transaction, which is leading to even more engagement on our apps and an elevated O2O journey. This is our vision for the marketplace, a digitally connected experience where membership is a true differentiator.
And just as our continuous product pipeline, we continue to innovate in the retail space. We're accelerating the shift we discussed last quarter to One NIKE marketplace as part of our digital, CDA acceleration. As you recall, our One NIKE marketplace approach leads with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent and seamless consumer experience. In fact, during the quarter, we took focused actions to proactively shift the North America marketplace as part of our strategy to serve consumers more consistently and more personally. Simply put, we're on the offense and accelerating toward this future vision. And this is evidenced by our new and innovative retail concepts, amplified by an elevated O2O consumer journey. Just in Q1, we launched new stores in Guangzhou, China; Seoul; Los Angeles; and Paris; with 2 new doors in New York City coming in the next few weeks. These stores range across many different formats, from our House of Innovation concept in Paris to a new Nike Factory Store in the Watts neighborhood of LA as we deepen our connection in key cities. And all these concepts are underpinned by digital.
I'll go a little deeper in one just as an example. Our new store in Guangzhou is a data-powered store concept that curates a one-to-one personalized shopping journey. We're already seeing member checkout in our Guangzhou store significantly outpace the rest of the fleet. This is just one reflection of how digitally enabled our future of retail is and how membership is a critical differentiator.
Personally, one of the things I am most thrilled about is the return to organized sport. In fact, there was a day earlier this month when you could watch the NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, WNBA, NHL, tennis, U.S. Open, a golf tournament and about 6 different global football leagues, all taking place within the same 24 hours. Though health and safety remain paramount, you can just feel the optimism and excitement of sport coming back. And as we look to the Tokyo Olympics next summer, NIKE remains in a unique position to serve our consumers and fuel their passion for sport.
And so as you can see, even during market uncertainty, we're not slowing down. NIKE is staying on the offense and looking to extend our leadership position. We have that ability. And as I've said before, these are times when the strong can get stronger, and I'm energized by our incredible potential.
And in closing, I want to thank our teammates all over the world who continue to innovate, execute and show tremendous resilience throughout a challenging year. I could not be more proud of them, and we can't wait to show you what we're going to do next. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
291981,685670129,2135481,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2020",2020-09-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE entered the pandemic with unparalleled brand and business momentum. And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned.

And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned. Interest and activity in health, fitness and wellness has never been greater. Consumer connection and engagement with our brand is growing, and NIKE is transforming the way we operate to better serve all consumers. Looking forward, we believe that NIKE is stronger and now even better positioned to drive separation than prior to the pandemic.
As I reflect on the first quarter, there are 3 key strategic and financial themes that stand out: first, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by brand momentum and our relentless focus on execution; second, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity; and third, our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Let me take a few minutes to walk through each of these points.
First, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we implemented an enterprise-wide operational plan at the onset of the pandemic. Our teams have navigated with agility and focus to recalibrate supply and demand, to increase digital distribution capacity, to secure liquidity and to tightly manage costs, all while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and consumers. As a result, NIKE, Inc.'s first quarter reported revenue declined 1% versus prior year and was flat on a constant currency basis, and reported EBIT grew 13% versus prior year, all a sharp acceleration from last quarter and exceeding our internal plans.
There are a few elements that are important for me to highlight here. Despite ongoing uncertainty, more countries are emerging from containment and have returned to growth: China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France and Germany, just to name a few. Marketplace inventory is healthy and within our targeted guardrails. NIKE inventory levels have improved since May, with Q1 inventory growing 15% versus prior year as compared to 31% growth in Q4, and is on track to be normalized in the next 60 days. We are reducing excess inventory at lower promotional levels relative to the overall marketplace, highlighting the strength of our brand and the value of our key product franchises. And we ended Q1 in a net cash position, generating positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity to over $13 billion.
These financial results offer clear evidence of a faster marketplace recovery for NIKE, fueled by consumer demand for all our brands. Our momentum is building. And more importantly, our market share is accelerating around the world. We now expect reported revenue to be roughly flat versus prior year in the first half of fiscal '21.
This leads me to the second theme, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer while simultaneously accelerating productivity. As you have seen over the last 2 quarters, our priorities are clear: we will continue to both accelerate investment against our digital transformation and prudently manage other spending. At the same time, we are focused on amplifying our brand impact.
Over the past 2 quarters, as we have seen demand for our digital business rapidly accelerate, we've invested to further increase digital fulfillment capacity and inventory visibility. Our new regional service center near Los Angeles went live this month and uses predictive modeling to anticipate consumer demand and ensure the product our consumers want is available and will arrive within 1 to 2 days. We will achieve this level of service at a lower fulfillment cost over time. We scaled ship-from-store capabilities in North America's NIKE Brand inline stores, which now represents over 20% of revenue in enabled doors. These capabilities will be enhanced by our RFID investments, highlighting dramatic improvement we are making in our O2O service performance.
We are scaling robotics and automation in our logistics operations, accelerating digital throughput and cutting order cycle times by up to 50%. Especially during times of heightened safety measures due to COVID-19, this allows our teams to serve higher levels of digital demand with greater efficiency and precision. We've already deployed this automation in North America, Japan and EMEA, and we'll continue to scale these critical improvements further as delivery becomes increasingly important in consumer buying decisions.
And while we double down on the strategic capability required to fuel our digital acceleration, we are simultaneously driving a sharper prioritization and sequencing of our investments. For example, we drove significant leverage in our demand creation spending versus prior year in the last 2 quarters, creating fewer but significantly more impactful brand campaigns. We were also able to increase the return on performance marketing investment, driving accelerated digital demand and greater digital engagement. The NIKE and Jordan brands are stronger than ever, delivering historic records of engagement through nearly 5 billion social media impressions just this quarter.
Another example is how our organizational restructuring will simplify the way we work, eliminate duplication and redundancy and realign our resources to focus on our biggest growth opportunities. While we will incur a nonrecurring charge to effect this plan in fiscal '21, this restructuring will also create a similar level of recurring annual cost savings that will help fuel the acceleration of our digital transformation. In this moment, the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate where and how we will invest. Ultimately, we will drive deeper consumer connections and continue to amplify our brand strength, using technology to operate more efficiently and at greater scale.
This brings me to my final theme. Our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our digital business grew 83% in Q1 on a currency-neutral basis. And as John mentioned, digital, across owned and partner, now represents over 30% of our total business, up more than 10 points of share versus the prior year. But more importantly, we saw tremendous momentum in the measures of success that matter most to create scale and drive long-term profitability. These include member engagement and owned digital market share. In Q1, NIKE active members increased nearly 60%, with even higher growth in buying members. We also drove strong double-digit growth in contactable members. We saw owned digital market share gains across both the U.S. and key countries in EMEA, which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain and to grow our digital penetration even as physical retail traffic continues to recover.
What's even more important though is that we can see several strategic and financial benefits from accelerating our digital transformation. First, by leveraging data to enhance membership, personalization and consumer-oriented O2O services across the marketplace, we can drive greater inventory efficiency and unlock accelerated growth in key opportunities like women's and apparel. Second, in a normalized period, we earned roughly 10 points higher gross margin rate on our digital revenue versus wholesale. And while we will need to continue investments to expand digital fulfillment capacity, we can improve operational efficiency through predictive modeling tools, data-driven member personalization and inventory staging. And finally, we will manage digital transformation within our SG&A guardrails.
As we accelerate the pace of investment, a technology foundation will enable us to unlock operating efficiency through automation and increased productivity across the organization. Further, as we grow digital engagement and we retain a higher proportion of engaged members with increased buying frequency, we will be lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing our return on ad spend and changing the shape of our demand creation investment. As John said earlier, we know that digital is the new normal. And as we drive continued separation in the market through connected, seamless and modern consumer experiences, we will fuel growth and profitability.
Now let's turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q revenue declined 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 13%, led by strong digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 versus the prior year as a result of impacts from COVID-19, including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs. These factors were offset slightly by favorable full price product margins and the reversal of certain reserves associated with purchase order cancellations due to higher-than-anticipated consumer demand.
SG&A declined 11% in Q1. We tightly managed operating expenses, including lower and more effective marketing spend as live sporting events slowly started to resume, while investing to support accelerating digital growth and transformation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5% compared to 12.4% for the same period last year, primarily due to benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a reserve for a discrete tax matter. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.95, up 10% versus prior year.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Despite varied recovery curves and macroeconomic dynamics, our geographies have some key themes in common in Q1: first, strong digital growth and increasing member engagement; second, women's outperformance versus men's and a growing Jordan brand; and third, lower physical traffic in our NIKE-owned stores versus last year, although substantially improved versus the prior quarter. Traffic trends were partially offset by higher conversion rates and higher spend per transaction.
In North America, specifically, Q1 revenue declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT increased 18% on a reported basis. Digital was up nearly 100%, driven by triple-digit growth in full price sales and fueled by strong momentum in iconic styles like the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, along with women's apparel, which grew nearly 200% in the quarter. Demand on the Nike App grew 150% in Q1, highlighting the continued shift to mobile experiences.
Finally, as we cut purchase orders to recalibrate supply and demand in North America during the first half of fiscal '21, we shifted product allocations to fuel higher demand in NIKE Digital and our smaller group of strategic wholesale partners. The result was high single-digit growth in differentiated wholesale, offset by a decline of over 20% in undifferentiated wholesale, all with a higher full price realization versus the prior year. This is a trend that we expect to continue throughout this fiscal year as we change the shape of the North America marketplace.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 14% on a reported basis. Recovery in Italy and Spain continues to lag recovery across the rest of Western Europe. NIKE Direct grew over 25% with over 100% digital growth, driven by lifestyle products as the consumer focus on comfort continues. Apparel in EMEA grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by the performance categories of running, training, basketball and global football, which featured our biggest club launch ever with Liverpool F.C. EMEA also continues to lead globally with our Express Lane offense, maximizing supply availability and actively managing inventory while capturing emerging trends. Express Lane drove revenue growth and generated higher full price realization in the quarter.
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which continued its strong momentum with 8% growth on a currency-neutral basis, with Mainland China delivering double-digit growth. NIKE Direct grew over 20%, with more balanced channel growth as digital grew nearly 30% and NIKE-owned stores were up double digits, fueled by key consumer moments like 618, where NIKE was the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Nike Sportswear and Basketball drove double-digit growth in the quarter with strong sell-through of key innovation launches like the Alphafly NEXT%, Space Hippie and the AJ1 FlyEase. Retail sales in the China marketplace are accelerating with an increasing proportion of full price sales. Physical retail traffic continues to grow and is approaching prior year levels. And we are also well positioned for Singles' Day in November.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q1 revenue declined 12% on a currency-neutral basis, including digital growth that exceeded 90%. We continue to see varied impacts of COVID-19 across countries in the region, with growth in the Asia Pacific region being led by Japan, Pacific and South Korea, while recovery in Latin America and certain countries in Southeast Asia continues at a slower pace. Performance footwear resonated with consumers in APLA this quarter as we saw strong results from the Alphafly NEXT% and the Pegasus 37. Jordan has also continued to excite the consumer with locally relevant product like the AJ34 Rui Hachimura, which was Japan's best-selling basketball launch ever.
As I said last quarter, fiscal '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty because virus-containment patterns around the world remain volatile. Therefore, each market recovery will not be linear, and the comparisons with prior year will become increasingly less intuitive. We are focused on what we can control: deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and our key product franchises.
With the first quarter now complete, I will update our full year financial outlook. Despite the continued uncertainties, we now expect revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits versus prior year. Stronger-than-anticipated demand for our brands will be constrained in the near term due to the supply decisions we took in the face of the pandemic, with growth in the second half to be up significantly versus prior year. Our gross margin outlook will continue to be a function of prioritizing a return to normalized inventory levels by the end of Q2. In the second half, we expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in full price sales, but we do expect a continuation of higher markdown activity in our factory stores to sustain conversion rates on lower traffic.
For the full year, we now expect gross margin to be flat versus prior year, including 40 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect SG&A will be flat versus prior year, including approximately $200 million to $250 million of nonrecurring execution costs incurred in the first half associated with simplifying our organizational structure.
NIKE is poised to emerge from the current environment stronger and better positioned with a sharper focus, a clearer view of our brand's long-term future and with a team that is energized to compete and to win. At the same time, we are managing our business to deliver financial results that will set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in FY '22 and beyond. The future for NIKE is bright. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

So in the first quarter, our gross margin was down 90 basis points versus prior year. And obviously, that was a substantial improvement versus the results we had in the fourth quarter, really reflecting the strength of NIKE's market recovery. However, Q1 did benefit from about 55 basis points of onetime accrual reversals that we had incurred in Q4. The biggest of which related to factory PO cancellations, which we reinstated some supply due to the strong demand we were seeing in the quarter. So if you add that back, you get to a gross margin that's down roughly 145 basis points versus the prior year, and that's driven by markdown activity to work through and normalize our supply.
As we look ahead to Q2, Bob, our margin will continue to be a function of supply and demand management because our top priority is to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And we expect Q2 will probably be more promotional than what we saw in Q1 because of holiday, the seasonal consumer moments like 11/11 in China, and then this year, we got Cyber Monday in Q2, whereas last year, it slipped into Q3. And we also are seeing, despite our strong performance, a lot of inventory still in the marketplace. And so that's how we're looking at the first half of the year.
As we look to the second half, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting sequential improvement with a higher mix of full price sales. And we'll start to see the benefits in our supply chain from exiting the extra storage that we needed for inventory in the first half. We also expect, though, that we're going to need to maintain an investment in discount in our factory stores because we're not anticipating traffic to recover to prior year levels in the balance of the year. And so we're assuming that there will continue to be some promotional activity in the second half of the year to maintain conversion rates and unit velocity as we keep -- as we continue to operate through the balance of the year. All in all, Bob, that just nets to about a flat versus prior year."

But yes, so it starts with where John was in his prepared remarks. We obviously believe that scale for our digital business is going to drive significant financial benefits as we continue to grow the size of that business and leverage the capabilities that we continue to develop.
I think there's probably 3 key drivers of operating margin improvement that we see from leveraging scale of our digital business. The first one just relates to leveraging data and the data that we continue to gather as a growing business to create personalized product offerings for consumers. And the benefit that, that will drive is higher full price realization and less markdowns of product that we're selling digitally to consumers.
The second piece is also kind of connected to data which is where do we place our inventory and how do we flow it so that we can be closer to the consumer and ultimately lower our fulfillment costs. And we believe that will continue to -- that will be a driver as well of continued gross margin expansion.
And then the third piece kind of ties back to what I referenced on our performance marketing, investment and marketing. We have got to move deeper into the funnel, less new -- moving from attracting and acquiring new members to retaining members, knowing those members and driving more engagement and frequency of purchase within our existing member base. And we believe that by running that offense, we will see more productivity in our demand creation spend and a higher return on our demand creation spend. And by doing that, we should be able to also drive additional operating margin expansion."

So we are seeing a benefit from increased digital penetration on our margins within those 2 geographies.

And so those 2 factors, in particular, were large drivers of gross margin performance in the quarter. And then we also had some SG&A leverage in those geographies in the quarter as we were managing spend and working through new ways of working from a corporate perspective.

Does that continue? And does it cascade down to college and high school and youth? I say my prayers every night, I hope so. I think the -- obviously, safety is paramount. And the more you get in a distributed environment, a less controlled environment, obviously, the more challenging that is. And so we completely embrace balancing safety but also return to sport. And I think the other part of -- this is not organized sport, what we're seeing is I think -- and I think these things are related. People are more engaged, sort of this movement toward health and fitness and wellness, which I think started when people being confined to their homes, we're seeing it continue to accelerate. You watch a game on TV, you want to go out for a run, right? You go shoot baskets in the driveway.
And so I think sport is so healthy for the world right now, and we're going to do everything we can, including, by the way, some of the brand moments that we're trying to celebrate to reinforce. I just love the Venus and Serena spot. It just celebrates the power sport has in connecting with consumers. And so you hear the excitement in my voice.

This quarter, we turned on machine learning on search, and a little bit of improvement drove greater conversion. By the way, that's continuous. So the ability to use AI and machine learning, digital demand sensing, insight gathering, digital marketing, membership personalization, even the inventory optimization, I think we still got ample benefits and ample opportunity in the consumer-facing side of things. And those are things like in technology, they're not big bangs. It's a whole series of continuous and ongoing improvement that, by the way, are very measurable and enhance growth or improve profitability.
And then beyond that, where I think we still have huge opportunities, we now have one integrated technology road map. And we're applying that across our entire company end-to-end, and so whether it is the manufacturing through supply chain and the automation opportunities that exists, whether it's using robotics or other ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, our whole product creation area. One of the people that is most excited about the opportunity to digitize is our Head of Design, John Hoke, and just how digital can really enhance not only the productivity but also the creativity of our designers. And so we now have a 3 -- a clear 3-year road map that -- to bring technology to every element of our operation and every element of our end-to-end business. And the nice thing about that is in almost every case, you can define measurable benefits, whether it's enhanced growth, deeper connection with consumers or improved efficiency with automation and use of -- intelligent use of technology. So I think all of us view this as a real opportunity."

As I mentioned in the last call, we believe that the consumer direct acceleration is clearly a tailwind or a fuel to our long-term financial model. Our goals and our principles related to how we financially manage the business are really unchanged to deliver sustainable, profitable and capital-efficient growth over time. Obviously, right now, we're in the middle of quite an uncertain moment and pandemic. And while we are sharing with you our perspectives on the opportunities that we see as we look towards the future, the reality is that this environment right now is quite uncertain. And so what we're going to be focused on over the next 90 to 120 days is continuing to clean our inventory, continuing to create those consumer connections like we have been talking about and really focus on our One NIKE marketplace strategy, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on the opportunities that we see for NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. And we believe that this strategy will fuel growth and profitability in line with the long-term financial model that we have previously communicated.
Obviously, there are a number of factors that are outstanding that may create disruption over periods of time as we look at it. And the most obvious one right now is just the pandemic and the impact it has on consumer demand and consumption in the near term. And so we're continuing to focus on the strategy and the shift because we think it's the right thing to do long term. And that's where our focus and attention is going to be at this time. We're investing and building this business for the long term, and that's where our focus is."

Before I get into our Q1 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of John Thompson last month. Coach, as many of us called him, was a beloved member of the NIKE family, having served on our Board of Directors for over 30 years. He was a true leader and an icon in the world of sports, and we will miss him.
And here on the West Coast, we're continuing to deal with the wildfires that have hit Oregon, Washington and California. Health and safety remain our first priority so we closed facilities and stores where appropriate. For those teammates who have been impacted by evacuation orders, we've made additional benefits and support available, and the NIKE foundation has donated $1 million to provide relief efforts for the Oregon wildfires, focusing on both intermediate- and longer-term needs.
Moving to our business results this quarter. We continue to demonstrate NIKE's full competitive advantage. Over the past several months, we've established clear objectives for our business, and we have been relentless in our focus on these objectives and the results are reflecting that. Our revenue trend is improving, with Q1 flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Greater China, EMEA, Japan and South Korea have already returned to growth. But more than the financial results, it's the continued strength of our brand, the response we're seeing from consumers and our unique position to be able to capitalize on our potential that excites me even more. We're getting stronger in the places that matter most. And even in the midst of disruption, we are on the offense. We have continued our unmatched pace of launching innovative product, generating a continuous flow of brand moments that connect with consumers and open groundbreaking retail concepts as we unlock significant long-term opportunity in a very dynamic environment.
We can navigate, in fact, we can thrive in this environment, thanks to our digital advantage and the full breadth of our global portfolio. Building on our foundational strengths, there are 3 structural tailwinds that play to NIKE's advantage: the accelerated consumer shift toward digital is here to stay; the definition of sport to include all facets of health, wellness and fitness; and it's the deeply connected authentic brands with scale that will win. NIKE's strength amid these evolving conditions help keep us in the lead. These advantages allow us to stay aggressive, and it's why I believe that no company is better positioned to emerge from this period than NIKE.
Over the past quarter, we continue to prove this out across 4 key areas. As always, it starts with product innovation. As I mentioned, our innovation pipeline and cadence has not slowed even during this uncertain environment. Second, our brand continues to deeply connect. Through the power of sport, we are creating hope and inspiration at a time when the world needs it. Third, we continue to take greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as the shift in consumer shopping preferences accelerates. And fourth, this digital focus is guiding how we create the future of retail as we continue to launch seamless premium brick-and-mortar experiences. Let me briefly touch on each of these 4 themes.
Our belief in innovation is embedded in everything we do. New innovation continues to resonate with our consumers, with key innovation platforms becoming an even bigger part of our mix in Q1. We had many product highlights this quarter. Let's just take a look at a few. We continue to bring fresh points of view to our most beloved footwear, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and our deep lineup of Air Max. By continuously adding new styles, we expand these popular platforms. And we're also focused on fueling a constant cycle of new, scalable, distinct platforms. For instance, we reenergized the iconic Air Max 90 this year, and it was one of the quarter's top growth drivers.
We also pushed what's possible in sport as seen in the latest launch of our NIKE NEXT% footwear platform. Eliud Kipchoge broke the 2-hour barrier in a prototype of the Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%. And now that consumers have access to this innovation, we have heard from many that they're running their fastest times ever. This summer, we also released a training shoe, the Air Zoom Tempo NEXT%, bringing the measurable benefit of NEXT% to runners focused on pace and endurance. And we're continuing to execute on the incredible opportunity we see in women's apparel. In Q1, we launched Nike (M), NIKE's first dedicated maternity collection.
We also introduced a new NIKE yoga collection that serves all genders and body types with performance fabric innovation that's the result of more than 2 years of development. The response to this best-in-class yoga collection has been amazing and is already driving incredible growth for our women's yoga business. And last but not least, our sustainable footwear platform known as Space Hippie saw amazing sell-through in our highest heat innovation launch ever. Coupled with the popularity we saw for VaporMax 2020, we are seeing real consumer appetite for sustainability, especially with our youngest consumers. Sustainability will continue to be a key aspect of our innovation agenda going forward.
This is how NIKE leads. Innovation is deeply ingrained in this company. And over the past 3 months, as most companies focused on just surviving, we are continuously bringing forward new compelling product to market. Our innovation pipeline demonstrates both our strength as well as our endurance. At NIKE, innovation is a systemic approach, and it's how we extend our lead.
Second, the power of the NIKE Brand continues to be felt all over the world. In all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumers' #1 favorite brand. In challenging times, we know how to drive meaningful connections with our consumers. You can see this in our market share gains across the NIKE and Jordan brands. Most notably, during the pandemic, we've seen an acceleration of share gains in U.S. women's and apparel, 2 areas of strategic focus. And as always, we connect with consumers through the power of sport. We continue to see strong consumer engagement in the You Can't Stop Sport campaign, with over 2.6 billion impressions as we've reached more than 800 million unique consumers around the world. Our latest films celebrate sport as a source of inspiration. From Serena and Venus Williams in You Can't Stop Sisters to a sport -- a spot celebrating Kobe Bryant, who continues to inspire athletes all over the world, on and off the court. The consumer energy around this broader campaign is testimony to NIKE's brand appeal at a time when so much is going on in the world.
And at the same time, we create experiences and services that inspire and enable our members to keep pushing themselves further. In Q1, we saw an all-time high of the percentage of our members working out on the Nike Training Club app, with more than 50% of our members worldwide starting a workout in Q1. And in the Nike Running Club, we've seen 4 consecutive months of more than 1 million downloads each month of our audio-guided runs. For those that have missed the camaraderie group runs during the pandemic, runners are telling us they're enjoying the connection and extra push offered by this feature. And in Q1, for the first time ever, women completed more of these runs than men.
We're also connecting to our purpose and values as our brand continues to be culturally embedded throughout the world of sport and beyond. Our athletes are doing the same. Just this month, you saw Naomi Osaka give voice to the Black Lives Matter movement by setting out the finals of the tournament just prior to the U.S. Open before returning to the U.S. Open and winning it. With leadership from global sports icons like Naomi and NBA players like LeBron and Giannis as well as the thousands of others who have stood up and spoken out, our athletes are having a profound impact in our society. All in all, from the cultural resonance of our brand to our expansion of what sport can mean, Q1 was a quarter that showed our relentless focus on deepening connections with our consumers matters.
Third, I continue to be excited about the opportunity I see for NIKE in digital. We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back. Our NIKE Digital business is already meeting our mixed goal of 30%, nearly 3 years ahead of schedule, and we will continue to grow from here. This quarter, our owned digital channel grew 83% on a currency-neutral basis, driving almost $900 million of incremental revenue versus the prior year and an acceleration versus the prior quarter, even as our doors at retail reopened.
Our engagement and membership metrics show incredible momentum. For example, we're seeing almost 200% growth in demand for our NIKE commerce app, with triple-digit growth in monthly active users. This is significant for us as it speaks to the increasing consumer adoption of our apps. And while we've had tremendous success in digital and quickly pivoted to the accelerated consumer shift, I truly believe that NIKE is just scratching the surface of what's possible. With our breadth and depth, no one has the advantage in this space that NIKE has to directly connect with consumers. NIKE's digital transformation strategy is not easily replicated. Simply put, scale matters. And NIKE leads, and we will continue to lead in this space for all the reasons I've already mentioned. Our size, our incredible product, our brand strength and affinity, the direct consumer relationships we deepen each day and our ability to create seamless and differentiated shopping experiences, that is how we drive continued separation.
Now we know this is a multiyear journey, and we have a bright future and lots of opportunity, but in many ways, we're just getting started. To date, we've done some impressive things to achieve scale, highlighted by our app ecosystem, our RFID investment and our omnichannel distribution centers. And as part of the consumer direct acceleration, we have some clear immediate priorities, including scaling O2O, improving personalization and creating a consistent end-to-end technology platform. And of course, we remain focused on increasing member engagement to unlock value for both NIKE and our consumers. After all, we know a consumer who connects with us on 2 or more platforms has a lifetime value that's 4x higher than those who don't. And in particular, I'm focused on how we will leverage consumer data and insights in our digital ecosystem to understand and serve consumers better and ultimately increase our competitive advantage. We'll use data to stay a step ahead and help us create a better product as consumer insights power our business end-to-end towards even greater growth.
Fourth and finally, digital is fueling how we create the future of retail. This is the first quarter since the start of the pandemic where our retail was essentially opened. And as more consumers return to our stores, we saw impressive conversion in-store, even as our digital business accelerated even further. Our store traffic and sales are improving quarter-over-quarter, and we're also seeing consumers increasingly self-identify as a member during checkout, or as we call it, a linked transaction, which is leading to even more engagement on our apps and an elevated O2O journey. This is our vision for the marketplace, a digitally connected experience where membership is a true differentiator.
And just as our continuous product pipeline, we continue to innovate in the retail space. We're accelerating the shift we discussed last quarter to One NIKE marketplace as part of our digital, CDA acceleration. As you recall, our One NIKE marketplace approach leads with NIKE Digital and our own stores as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent and seamless consumer experience. In fact, during the quarter, we took focused actions to proactively shift the North America marketplace as part of our strategy to serve consumers more consistently and more personally. Simply put, we're on the offense and accelerating toward this future vision. And this is evidenced by our new and innovative retail concepts, amplified by an elevated O2O consumer journey. Just in Q1, we launched new stores in Guangzhou, China; Seoul; Los Angeles; and Paris; with 2 new doors in New York City coming in the next few weeks. These stores range across many different formats, from our House of Innovation concept in Paris to a new Nike Factory Store in the Watts neighborhood of LA as we deepen our connection in key cities. And all these concepts are underpinned by digital.
I'll go a little deeper in one just as an example. Our new store in Guangzhou is a data-powered store concept that curates a one-to-one personalized shopping journey. We're already seeing member checkout in our Guangzhou store significantly outpace the rest of the fleet. This is just one reflection of how digitally enabled our future of retail is and how membership is a critical differentiator.
Personally, one of the things I am most thrilled about is the return to organized sport. In fact, there was a day earlier this month when you could watch the NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, WNBA, NHL, tennis, U.S. Open, a golf tournament and about 6 different global football leagues, all taking place within the same 24 hours. Though health and safety remain paramount, you can just feel the optimism and excitement of sport coming back. And as we look to the Tokyo Olympics next summer, NIKE remains in a unique position to serve our consumers and fuel their passion for sport.
And so as you can see, even during market uncertainty, we're not slowing down. NIKE is staying on the offense and looking to extend our leadership position. We have that ability. And as I've said before, these are times when the strong can get stronger, and I'm energized by our incredible potential.
And in closing, I want to thank our teammates all over the world who continue to innovate, execute and show tremendous resilience throughout a challenging year. I could not be more proud of them, and we can't wait to show you what we're going to do next. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt."
291981,685670129,2135483,"NIKE, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Sep 22, 2020",2020-09-22,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call.

And while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned. Interest and activity in health, fitness and wellness has never been greater. Consumer connection and engagement with our brand is growing, and NIKE is transforming the way we operate to better serve all consumers. Looking forward, we believe that NIKE is stronger and now even better positioned to drive separation than prior to the pandemic.
As I reflect on the first quarter, there are 3 key strategic and financial themes that stand out: first, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by brand momentum and our relentless focus on execution; second, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity; and third, our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Let me take a few minutes to walk through each of these points.
First, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we implemented an enterprise-wide operational plan at the onset of the pandemic. Our teams have navigated with agility and focus to recalibrate supply and demand, to increase digital distribution capacity, to secure liquidity and to tightly manage costs, all while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and consumers. As a result, NIKE, Inc.'s first quarter reported revenue declined 1% versus prior year and was flat on a constant currency basis, and reported EBIT grew 13% versus prior year, all a sharp acceleration from last quarter and exceeding our internal plans.
There are a few elements that are important for me to highlight here. Despite ongoing uncertainty, more countries are emerging from containment and have returned to growth: China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France and Germany, just to name a few. Marketplace inventory is healthy and within our targeted guardrails. NIKE inventory levels have improved since May, with Q1 inventory growing 15% versus prior year as compared to 31% growth in Q4, and is on track to be normalized in the next 60 days. We are reducing excess inventory at lower promotional levels relative to the overall marketplace, highlighting the strength of our brand and the value of our key product franchises. And we ended Q1 in a net cash position, generating positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity to over $13 billion.
These financial results offer clear evidence of a faster marketplace recovery for NIKE, fueled by consumer demand for all our brands. Our momentum is building. And more importantly, our market share is accelerating around the world. We now expect reported revenue to be roughly flat versus prior year in the first half of fiscal '21.
This leads me to the second theme, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer while simultaneously accelerating productivity. As you have seen over the last 2 quarters, our priorities are clear: we will continue to both accelerate investment against our digital transformation and prudently manage other spending. At the same time, we are focused on amplifying our brand impact.
Over the past 2 quarters, as we have seen demand for our digital business rapidly accelerate, we've invested to further increase digital fulfillment capacity and inventory visibility. Our new regional service center near Los Angeles went live this month and uses predictive modeling to anticipate consumer demand and ensure the product our consumers want is available and will arrive within 1 to 2 days. We will achieve this level of service at a lower fulfillment cost over time. We scaled ship-from-store capabilities in North America's NIKE Brand inline stores, which now represents over 20% of revenue in enabled doors. These capabilities will be enhanced by our RFID investments, highlighting dramatic improvement we are making in our O2O service performance.
We are scaling robotics and automation in our logistics operations, accelerating digital throughput and cutting order cycle times by up to 50%. Especially during times of heightened safety measures due to COVID-19, this allows our teams to serve higher levels of digital demand with greater efficiency and precision. We've already deployed this automation in North America, Japan and EMEA, and we'll continue to scale these critical improvements further as delivery becomes increasingly important in consumer buying decisions.
And while we double down on the strategic capability required to fuel our digital acceleration, we are simultaneously driving a sharper prioritization and sequencing of our investments. For example, we drove significant leverage in our demand creation spending versus prior year in the last 2 quarters, creating fewer but significantly more impactful brand campaigns. We were also able to increase the return on performance marketing investment, driving accelerated digital demand and greater digital engagement. The NIKE and Jordan brands are stronger than ever, delivering historic records of engagement through nearly 5 billion social media impressions just this quarter.
Another example is how our organizational restructuring will simplify the way we work, eliminate duplication and redundancy and realign our resources to focus on our biggest growth opportunities. While we will incur a nonrecurring charge to effect this plan in fiscal '21, this restructuring will also create a similar level of recurring annual cost savings that will help fuel the acceleration of our digital transformation. In this moment, the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate where and how we will invest. Ultimately, we will drive deeper consumer connections and continue to amplify our brand strength, using technology to operate more efficiently and at greater scale.
This brings me to my final theme. Our consumer-led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our digital business grew 83% in Q1 on a currency-neutral basis. And as John mentioned, digital, across owned and partner, now represents over 30% of our total business, up more than 10 points of share versus the prior year. But more importantly, we saw tremendous momentum in the measures of success that matter most to create scale and drive long-term profitability. These include member engagement and owned digital market share. In Q1, NIKE active members increased nearly 60%, with even higher growth in buying members. We also drove strong double-digit growth in contactable members. We saw owned digital market share gains across both the U.S. and key countries in EMEA, which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain and to grow our digital penetration even as physical retail traffic continues to recover.
What's even more important though is that we can see several strategic and financial benefits from accelerating our digital transformation. First, by leveraging data to enhance membership, personalization and consumer-oriented O2O services across the marketplace, we can drive greater inventory efficiency and unlock accelerated growth in key opportunities like women's and apparel. Second, in a normalized period, we earned roughly 10 points higher gross margin rate on our digital revenue versus wholesale. And while we will need to continue investments to expand digital fulfillment capacity, we can improve operational efficiency through predictive modeling tools, data-driven member personalization and inventory staging. And finally, we will manage digital transformation within our SG&A guardrails.
As we accelerate the pace of investment, a technology foundation will enable us to unlock operating efficiency through automation and increased productivity across the organization. Further, as we grow digital engagement and we retain a higher proportion of engaged members with increased buying frequency, we will be lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing our return on ad spend and changing the shape of our demand creation investment. As John said earlier, we know that digital is the new normal. And as we drive continued separation in the market through connected, seamless and modern consumer experiences, we will fuel growth and profitability.
Now let's turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q revenue declined 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 13%, led by strong digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 versus the prior year as a result of impacts from COVID-19, including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs. These factors were offset slightly by favorable full price product margins and the reversal of certain reserves associated with purchase order cancellations due to higher-than-anticipated consumer demand.
SG&A declined 11% in Q1. We tightly managed operating expenses, including lower and more effective marketing spend as live sporting events slowly started to resume, while investing to support accelerating digital growth and transformation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5% compared to 12.4% for the same period last year, primarily due to benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a reserve for a discrete tax matter. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.95, up 10% versus prior year.
With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Despite varied recovery curves and macroeconomic dynamics, our geographies have some key themes in common in Q1: first, strong digital growth and increasing member engagement; second, women's outperformance versus men's and a growing Jordan brand; and third, lower physical traffic in our NIKE-owned stores versus last year, although substantially improved versus the prior quarter. Traffic trends were partially offset by higher conversion rates and higher spend per transaction.
In North America, specifically, Q1 revenue declined 1% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT increased 18% on a reported basis. Digital was up nearly 100%, driven by triple-digit growth in full price sales and fueled by strong momentum in iconic styles like the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, along with women's apparel, which grew nearly 200% in the quarter. Demand on the Nike App grew 150% in Q1, highlighting the continued shift to mobile experiences.
Finally, as we cut purchase orders to recalibrate supply and demand in North America during the first half of fiscal '21, we shifted product allocations to fuel higher demand in NIKE Digital and our smaller group of strategic wholesale partners. The result was high single-digit growth in differentiated wholesale, offset by a decline of over 20% in undifferentiated wholesale, all with a higher full price realization versus the prior year. This is a trend that we expect to continue throughout this fiscal year as we change the shape of the North America marketplace.
In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 14% on a reported basis. Recovery in Italy and Spain continues to lag recovery across the rest of Western Europe. NIKE Direct grew over 25% with over 100% digital growth, driven by lifestyle products as the consumer focus on comfort continues. Apparel in EMEA grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by the performance categories of running, training, basketball and global football, which featured our biggest club launch ever with Liverpool F.C. EMEA also continues to lead globally with our Express Lane offense, maximizing supply availability and actively managing inventory while capturing emerging trends. Express Lane drove revenue growth and generated higher full price realization in the quarter.
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which continued its strong momentum with 8% growth on a currency-neutral basis, with Mainland China delivering double-digit growth. NIKE Direct grew over 20%, with more balanced channel growth as digital grew nearly 30% and NIKE-owned stores were up double digits, fueled by key consumer moments like 618, where NIKE was the #1 sports brand on Tmall. Nike Sportswear and Basketball drove double-digit growth in the quarter with strong sell-through of key innovation launches like the Alphafly NEXT%, Space Hippie and the AJ1 FlyEase. Retail sales in the China marketplace are accelerating with an increasing proportion of full price sales. Physical retail traffic continues to grow and is approaching prior year levels. And we are also well positioned for Singles' Day in November.
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q1 revenue declined 12% on a currency-neutral basis, including digital growth that exceeded 90%. We continue to see varied impacts of COVID-19 across countries in the region, with growth in the Asia Pacific region being led by Japan, Pacific and South Korea, while recovery in Latin America and certain countries in Southeast Asia continues at a slower pace. Performance footwear resonated with consumers in APLA this quarter as we saw strong results from the Alphafly NEXT% and the Pegasus 37. Jordan has also continued to excite the consumer with locally relevant product like the AJ34 Rui Hachimura, which was Japan's best-selling basketball launch ever.
As I said last quarter, fiscal '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty because virus-containment patterns around the world remain volatile. Therefore, each market recovery will not be linear, and the comparisons with prior year will become increasingly less intuitive. We are focused on what we can control: deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and our key product franchises.
With the first quarter now complete, I will update our full year financial outlook. Despite the continued uncertainties, we now expect revenue to be up high single digits to low double digits versus prior year. Stronger-than-anticipated demand for our brands will be constrained in the near term due to the supply decisions we took in the face of the pandemic, with growth in the second half to be up significantly versus prior year. Our gross margin outlook will continue to be a function of prioritizing a return to normalized inventory levels by the end of Q2. In the second half, we expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in full price sales, but we do expect a continuation of higher markdown activity in our factory stores to sustain conversion rates on lower traffic.
For the full year, we now expect gross margin to be flat versus prior year, including 40 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect SG&A will be flat versus prior year, including approximately $200 million to $250 million of nonrecurring execution costs incurred in the first half associated with simplifying our organizational structure.
NIKE is poised to emerge from the current environment stronger and better positioned with a sharper focus, a clearer view of our brand's long-term future and with a team that is energized to compete and to win. At the same time, we are managing our business to deliver financial results that will set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in FY '22 and beyond. The future for NIKE is bright. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone.
With that, we'll now open the call up for questions."

So in the first quarter, our gross margin was down 90 basis points versus prior year. And obviously, that was a substantial improvement versus the results we had in the fourth quarter, really reflecting the strength of NIKE's market recovery. However, Q1 did benefit from about 55 basis points of onetime accrual reversals that we had incurred in Q4. The biggest of which related to factory PO cancellations, which we reinstated some supply due to the strong demand we were seeing in the quarter. So if you add that back, you get to a gross margin that's down roughly 145 basis points versus the prior year, and that's driven by markdown activity to work through and normalize our supply.
As we look ahead to Q2, Bob, our margin will continue to be a function of supply and demand management because our top priority is to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And we expect Q2 will probably be more promotional than what we saw in Q1 because of holiday, the seasonal consumer moments like 11/11 in China, and then this year, we got Cyber Monday in Q2, whereas last year, it slipped into Q3. And we also are seeing, despite our strong performance, a lot of inventory still in the marketplace. And so that's how we're looking at the first half of the year.
As we look to the second half, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting sequential improvement with a higher mix of full price sales. And we'll start to see the benefits in our supply chain from exiting the extra storage that we needed for inventory in the first half. We also expect, though, that we're going to need to maintain an investment in discount in our factory stores because we're not anticipating traffic to recover to prior year levels in the balance of the year. And so we're assuming that there will continue to be some promotional activity in the second half of the year to maintain conversion rates and unit velocity as we keep -- as we continue to operate through the balance of the year. All in all, Bob, that just nets to about a flat versus prior year."

But yes, so it starts with where John was in his prepared remarks. We obviously believe that scale for our digital business is going to drive significant financial benefits as we continue to grow the size of that business and leverage the capabilities that we continue to develop.
I think there's probably 3 key drivers of operating margin improvement that we see from leveraging scale of our digital business. The first one just relates to leveraging data and the data that we continue to gather as a growing business to create personalized product offerings for consumers. And the benefit that, that will drive is higher full price realization and less markdowns of product that we're selling digitally to consumers.
The second piece is also kind of connected to data which is where do we place our inventory and how do we flow it so that we can be closer to the consumer and ultimately lower our fulfillment costs. And we believe that will continue to -- that will be a driver as well of continued gross margin expansion.
And then the third piece kind of ties back to what I referenced on our performance marketing, investment and marketing. We have got to move deeper into the funnel, less new -- moving from attracting and acquiring new members to retaining members, knowing those members and driving more engagement and frequency of purchase within our existing member base. And we believe that by running that offense, we will see more productivity in our demand creation spend and a higher return on our demand creation spend. And by doing that, we should be able to also drive additional operating margin expansion."

So we are seeing a benefit from increased digital penetration on our margins within those 2 geographies. But I would also want to highlight that the strategy and the focus on shifting the marketplace, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on our direct business and our strategic partners drove higher full price realization as well in both of those markets in the quarter, which also fueled our gross margin. And so those 2 factors, in particular, were large drivers of gross margin performance in the quarter. And then we also had some SG&A leverage in those geographies in the quarter as we were managing spend and working through new ways of working from a corporate perspective.

And so we are thrilled about that. We're trying to work very closely with them to help encourage that wherever possible. We think that's good for consumers, and it's ultimately good for NIKE.
Does that continue? And does it cascade down to college and high school and youth? I say my prayers every night, I hope so. I think the -- obviously, safety is paramount. And the more you get in a distributed environment, a less controlled environment, obviously, the more challenging that is. And so we completely embrace balancing safety but also return to sport. And I think the other part of -- this is not organized sport, what we're seeing is I think -- and I think these things are related. People are more engaged, sort of this movement toward health and fitness and wellness, which I think started when people being confined to their homes, we're seeing it continue to accelerate. You watch a game on TV, you want to go out for a run, right? You go shoot baskets in the driveway.
And so I think sport is so healthy for the world right now, and we're going to do everything we can, including, by the way, some of the brand moments that we're trying to celebrate to reinforce. I just love the Venus and Serena spot. It just celebrates the power sport has in connecting with consumers. And so you hear the excitement in my voice.

This quarter, we turned on machine learning on search, and a little bit of improvement drove greater conversion. By the way, that's continuous.

As I mentioned in the last call, we believe that the consumer direct acceleration is clearly a tailwind or a fuel to our long-term financial model. Our goals and our principles related to how we financially manage the business are really unchanged to deliver sustainable, profitable and capital-efficient growth over time. Obviously, right now, we're in the middle of quite an uncertain moment and pandemic. And while we are sharing with you our perspectives on the opportunities that we see as we look towards the future, the reality is that this environment right now is quite uncertain. And so what we're going to be focused on over the next 90 to 120 days is continuing to clean our inventory, continuing to create those consumer connections like we have been talking about and really focus on our One NIKE marketplace strategy, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on the opportunities that we see for NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. And we believe that this strategy will fuel growth and profitability in line with the long-term financial model that we have previously communicated.
Obviously, there are a number of factors that are outstanding that may create disruption over periods of time as we look at it. And the most obvious one right now is just the pandemic and the impact it has on consumer demand and consumption in the near term. And so we're continuing to focus on the strategy and the shift because we think it's the right thing to do long term. And that's where our focus and attention is going to be at this time. We're investing and building this business for the long term, and that's where our focus is."

Before I get into our Q2 performance, I want to acknowledge the global environment right now. We continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic with surges across the U.S. and in many countries around the world. In fact, consistent with social distancing norms, Matt, Andy and I are doing this call from our homes. So if this audio sounds a little different, that's life in the Zoom world. And we're feeling optimistic with positive news on vaccines. But in the meantime, we hope everyone stays safe out there. 
Looking at Q2, our strong business results reflect our relentless focus on our objectives. I'm going to talk this quarter about the same themes I talked about last quarter and most probably next quarter, I'll talk to you about them again. The reason for this consistency is that our strategy is sound, our strategy is working, and we're excited by what we're seeing as we continue to execute it. In Q2, we returned to growth of 9% on a reported basis. This revenue improvement reflects currency-neutral growth across all of our geographies, NIKE Digital up 80% globally and women's growth outpacing our overall growth. 
But beyond any one quarter's results, the clear momentum we have right now is evidence of our product innovation and brand strength that allows us to connect with consumers worldwide. I've said it before, these are times when strong brands get stronger. The structural tailwinds we're seeing, including permitted shifts toward digital, athletic wear and health and wellness, continue to offer us incredible opportunity. And of course, as organized sport returns around the world, that energy creates yet another tailwind for NIKE. For example, we were excited to see so many runners participating in the Shanghai Marathon 2 weeks ago. 
Speaking of Greater China, the growth we saw there in Q2 was evidence of the progress we've made toward our end-to-end digital transformation, which allows us to better manage volatility and deliver strong growth. As a result, in Q2, Greater China grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis and 24% on a reported basis. Our success in Greater China was also driven by a triumphant Singles' Day, in which NIKE yet again was the #1 sports brand with the highest store demand and highest traffic on Tmall. This growth underscores how we engage with consumers on Singles' Day, bringing more than 4 million new members to NIKE. Overall, Singles' Day drove more than $0.5 billion in digital demand. 
More broadly, this holiday season also was highlighted by the record-setting digital sales we saw during Black Friday week, which has shown the power of our digital transformation all over the globe. Digital is now woven into everything we do as a company. It's how we operate and prioritize, from how we engage with members, to how we operate our supply chain, to how we serve consumers in the marketplace. 
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 key areas of increasing competitive advantage for us: Our leadership in innovation and our incredible brand momentum. Let's start with product and innovation. Innovation has always been our lifeblood at NIKE. It's what continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our return to growth this quarter was fueled by our relentless innovation pipeline. In the last 90 days, we've introduced exciting products at an impressive pace, and this will continue going forward. Through innovation, we are serving consumers in ways no other brand can. We're using digital to connect product to consumers like never before. We're bringing more athletes into sport through inclusivity, and we're scaling sustainable materials further in our product portfolio. 
This quarter's launches in basketball, including the LeBron 18 and the Kyrie 7, have sold incredibly well. I'm particularly excited that both were launched digital first. The LeBron 18 was introduced in September through an integrated live stream with Tencent in Greater China, driving deeper connection to local hoops culture. And we launched the Kyrie 7 by announcing 4 colorways available only as mystery repurchases through the SNKRS App. 
In women's, our M Maternity Collection is connecting with consumers in the marketplace with 100% sell-through of tights in the first 2 days. Due to high consumer demand for our new maternity wear, we're bringing more units into the marketplace and rolling out more content and inspiration for women pre and post partum on our activity apps. This is a great example of how we start with product and then scale further through engagement to deepen our connection with consumers. 
We also grow sport through inclusivity. For example, we continue to extend our size offerings as we give more consumers access to sport. For example, in women's, we now have more than 100 styles of extended sized apparel across NIKE and Jordan, and we will continue to further increase our offering. And this quarter, we launched extended sizing in our kids business in North America with a plan to increase to 25% of our kids assortment next summer. 
Finally, sustainability will always be core to our innovation efforts. 85% of our recently launched ACG apparel collection contains more than 90% recycled materials. And we'll also continue to scale sustainability through our sportwear icons. In fact, just this past quarter, we launched our new sustainable creator foam in both Air Force 1 and Waffle Racer. The demand for these products and more shows that consumer hunger for sustainability continues to accelerate. 
We are proud of this innovation pipeline, and we have no plans to slow down. In coming quarters, new innovations will include exciting new women's product in Jordan Brand, a new learning style designed to help reduce injury and our first performance shoe in our sustainable footwear platform. Innovation differentiates NIKE. We don't settle for the lead, and our ability to innovate remains unrivaled. It's so fundamental to us that we increased our investment in innovation during the uncertainty of the pandemic to create even further separation. This is how NIKE stays in the lead. 
Moving to our brand strength. Our deep connection with consumers through authentic brand moments at global scale also continues to expand our leadership position. As I said earlier, the strong are getting stronger, and our scale is unmatched. In Q2, NIKE generated over 7 billion brand impressions across social platforms globally, directly connecting with consumers on the platforms where they spend their time. For example, our Never Too Far Down film became the #1 ad that consumers chose to watch on YouTube during 2020. And these touch points led to over 400 million social engagements. It's clear we're not just reaching our consumers, we're creating dialogue and opportunities for action that continue to exceed our own internal benchmarks. 
This deep and meaningful connection has a direct result, a NIKE membership. Since a pandemic began, we've added more than 70 million new members globally. And we're deeply focused on the member funnel outcomes, including new member buying, reactivation and retention, and it's working. Importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new and active member growth. And growth in member demand is outpacing total digital growth. 
As we drive our membership efforts, we continue to innovate how we serve members. This quarter, NIKE hosted our first-ever globally coordinated member days, which demonstrate how we continue to create value for NIKE members. This unique retail moment offers first access to product, rewards for activity and exclusives across stores and digital. This event reached over 60 million members across 25 countries, driving higher engagement and conversion metrics for the quarter. 
And in Q2, we once again used the SNKRS App to push digital retail to the next level. Sneakers remains one of NIKE's greatest competitive advantages, delivering truly innovative features for consumers. For example, this quarter, we launched sneakers live with our first-ever product drop via live streaming, resulting in a 100% sell-through of the Air Jordan 4 PSG in under 2 minutes. This live streaming capability is now fully launched in both North America and EMEA with plans to expand in Japan. Live interaction creates stronger member engagement with NIKE, giving them better access to our best products and experiences. We see so much value here that we opened a brand-new live streaming studio in Greater China just in time for Singles Day. 
Simply put, the NIKE brand is strong. We have a scale that's unparalleled, and the brand is creating meaningful connections everywhere the Swoosh exists. Just look at our results this quarter. Our brands power this year has been second to none. 
Before I wrap up, I want to give a little more context for a number I mentioned earlier, our 80% NIKE Digital growth this quarter. We've now had 3 straight quarters of roughly 80% digital growth. As we've said, this growth won't always be so uniform, but we are growing the pie and taking share from competition. This is the sharp point of our strategy. The consumer shift to digital is permanent, and our digital penetration will only increase in years to come. 
Across the quarter, our innovation pipeline and brand strength positioned us to continue to navigate a dynamic environment with agility. We have a proven playbook, led by digital. The foundation of this playbook is our commitment to product and consumer connection. The fundamental truth of NIKE is that our innovation and brand strength continue to set the pace. 
Now Matt will give you more detail on our playbook. But before he does, I'd like to finish by saluting our teams around the globe. Since the start of the pandemic, we've said that we would stay on the offense, and the credit for that continued effort and execution goes to our team. Around the world in every facet of our business and our organization, they continue to demonstrate commitment, resilience and creativity. I could not be prouder of everyone on the NIKE team, and I genuinely thank them. 
And now I'll turn things over to Matt."

As I said in our last call, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by our unparalleled brand momentum and sharp focus on operational execution. Consumer engagement with our brands continues to grow in frequency and depth through the power of our product franchises and fresh storytelling delivered through improved digital and physical experiences. 
Our financial results in the second quarter and for the first half of fiscal '21 are proof that NIKE has recovered and is moving forward. We have a new consumer offense and a clear vision for how we will engage and serve consumer demand for our brands through digital, leveraging a technology-enabled operating model, which is being built for greater speed, efficiency and effectiveness. While uncertainty due to the global pandemic persists, our teams are now better equipped than ever to navigate through the dynamics we face. We continue to leverage our operational playbook, and we learn more every week. Our leadership momentum and trajectory in Greater China is helping to shape decisions we are making around the rest of the world. Our teams are sharply focused on the key metrics that matter most to accelerate the pace of our recovery and return to sustainable, profitable growth. 
In June, we set clear measures of success for the first half of this fiscal year, and now 6 months later, we've exceeded those goals. Let me share a few of the highlights. We said inventory would return to a healthy and normalized level by the end of Q2. And now through intentional supply and demand management actions, marketplace health has been restored across all geographies without compromising the value of our brands and product franchises. And NIKE-owned inventory is clean, ending Q2 down 2% versus prior year while delivering 9% revenue growth on a reported basis. We said that digital acceleration brought on by COVID-19 was indicative of a new future marketplace and not a temporary phenomenon. In Q1, we exceeded our digital penetration goal of 30% across owned and partnered, almost 3 years earlier than planned. Now in Q2, our momentum continues with 80% NIKE Digital revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we increased our digital penetration further by improving product availability through search optimization, moving inventory across marketplace channels and increasing digital fulfillment capacity through scale and automation. 
We said we would tightly manage costs, and in the first half of fiscal '21, SG&A declined 6% versus prior year. Over the course of the last 6 months, we have reduced discretionary spending in nonpriority areas while accelerating investment to support our digital transformation and realigning our organization to a new consumer construct. And finally, we said our product pipeline would remain robust. And you've seen us continue a consistent flow of innovation and new storytelling around our most important product franchises. This has translated into deep consumer engagement with our brands and market share gains, driving first half revenue growth of 4% versus the prior year. Simply put, we have executed on our plan, and NIKE is now even better positioned to compete and serve consumers than prior to the pandemic. 
Now as we look ahead to the second half of fiscal '21 and beyond, I want to share some perspective on how we will strategically and financially manage the company. You've heard me talk about these principles before, and I will continue to reiterate them as we execute against our strategy and transform our business. First and foremost, despite the short-term uncertainty, we are managing the business and making decisions for the long term. Consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, and NIKE's market opportunity is as large as ever. While short-term consumer demand may continue to be impacted, we are focused on moving faster against the most important elements to position NIKE for the long term: deepening relationships our 3 brands have with consumers, scaling direct connections with contactable members, expanding capabilities to manage a rapidly growing digital business and transforming and elevating the marketplace. 
Second, we will continue to optimize supply and demand with speed and agility, maintaining healthy inventory levels and increasing full price realization. Capabilities like Express Lane, now operationalized in all 4 geographies and representing almost 20% of our total business, enables increased flexibility and responsiveness in serving consumer demand while driving higher profitability. Third, we will capitalize on the relative speed of our recovery and our financial strength by accelerating investment levels from the first half. Our investment priorities will be focused on a few key areas. We will begin to rebuild investment in demand creation, activating against major sports moments, athletes and innovation and expanding the reach and impact of significant growth opportunities in women's, apparel, digital and our Jordan Brand. 
We expect demand creation as a percentage of revenue will gradually increase versus recent quarters, although new capabilities and a member-focused digital marketing model will enable greater return on investment over time. We will create a digital-first supply chain, built on a strong technology and analytics foundation in order to optimize service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We already see return on our investments in North America, where we ramped up our new regional service center in Los Angeles to serve peak holiday demand, aided by capabilities from our Celect acquisition. As a result, we delivered over 100% NIKE Digital revenue growth in Q2 in North America while lowering digital fulfillment cost per unit versus the prior year. We will accelerate the technology enablement of our operating model to change the speed with which we directly engage with and serve the consumer from online to off-line services, digital marketing, personalization and digital supply and demand management. 
In North America, we leveraged new tools to make dynamic pricing decisions during Black Friday. We also continue to scale RFID capabilities across our stores in EMEA, enabling better product allocation and replenishment, and we began testing consumer-facing RFID capabilities like self-checkout in our stores in Korea. In the marketplace, we will increase the pace of opening new stores as we create an elevated, differentiated and digitally connected experience for our consumers. In Q2 alone, we opened 2 Nike live and 6 Nike Unite stores, which is our next-generation factory store concept. And we plan to open an additional 30 stores in the second half of this fiscal year and even more in fiscal year '22, enabling accelerated growth in women's digital and apparel. 
And finally, we will drive strong free cash flow growth and consistent balance sheet management as we target leverage down towards pre-pandemic levels. We recently announced a 12% increase in our annual dividend, and when appropriate, we'll resume share repurchase activity. The underlying benefits from our business shift towards NIKE Digital and NIKE Direct are becoming increasingly clear, and these principles will enable us to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. 
Now let's turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 9% in Q2, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis; as NIKE Direct grew 30%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth of 80% and partially offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q2 versus the prior year, resulting from higher promotional activity to reduce excess inventories. Performance in the quarter was impacted by nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment, which reduced gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
SG&A declined 2% in the quarter as disciplined expense management and lower marketing spend on brand and sports events was partially offset by increased investments in digital marketing. This quarter, SG&A was also negatively impacted by approximately $135 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 10.7% for the same period last year, primarily due to changes in our earnings mix and an increase in tax associated with recently finalized U.S. tax regulations and increased benefits from stock compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.78, up 11% versus the prior year. 
With that, let's turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 1% and includes noncomparable items in the prior year, such as the sale of Hurley and the transition of our NFL license business to fanatics. And Q2 EBIT increased 17% on a reported basis. Q2 provided more clear evidence on the state of our marketplace transformation and shift in channel mix. Despite a 14% decline in wholesale revenue and traffic in NIKE-owned stores remaining well below prior year levels, North America was able to grow 1% overall due to more than 100% growth in NIKE Digital. NIKE Digital now represents nearly 25% of our North America business, and it continues to serve a broader consumer base. In Q2, member days drove records for weekly member metrics and engagement with strong NIKE Digital performance in women's, apparel and sub-$100 product, all areas of significant growth opportunity. 
Within wholesale, we continue to shift the marketplace towards differentiated retail. And to give you some context on our progress leading up to the pandemic, over the last 3 years, we have reduced the number of undifferentiated accounts in North America by roughly 30% while still delivering mid-single-digit growth on average. And in Q2, as we manage product supply in response to the pandemic, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocations to benefit our strategic partners and NIKE Direct. As a result, undifferentiated wholesale revenue declined at an even faster rate compared to total wholesale. Looking forward, over the next 2 years, we will more aggressively accelerate change with larger undifferentiated accounts as we and our strategic partners together reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture short-term demand dislocation. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 29% on a reported basis. Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions in November, EMEA continued to drive momentum in Q2 through strong weekly sales growth and a higher full price realization. NIKE Direct grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis. And wholesale grew 6% in the quarter, led by strong double-digit strategic partner growth in JD Sports and Zalando, partially offset by double-digit declines in undifferentiated wholesale. NIKE Digital grew nearly 100% driven by Cyber Week that broke records across revenue and member engagement. In our NIKE-owned stores, we continued expansion of services to consumers. We piloted virtual experts sessions at NikeTown London, driving increases in conversion and basket size, with plans to scale this capability across EMEA. And we utilized digital queuing and additional self-checkout options to improve the consumer experience and safety. 
Our Express Lane offense in EMEA once again drove significant growth in Q2, increasing more than 30% versus the prior year. This is a key enabler to navigating the current environment through a more flexible inventory strategy. We lowered futures bookings for holiday and leveraged Express Lane to replenish inventory on a significantly shorter lead time and responding to current retail trends. And with the recent lockdown measures announced this week, we will be agile in managing ongoing uncertainty by leveraging our operational playbook. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which achieved its first $2 billion quarter and grew an incredible 19% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2 with EBIT growth of 28% on a reported basis. As John mentioned earlier, Singles' Day drove significant growth in the quarter with over $0.5 billion in digital demand. In order to fulfill the record level of orders, we implemented several initiatives to maximize flexibility and responsiveness in our supply chain. From enabling multi-node network fulfillment to employing robot delivery and green packaging, the Greater China team was prepared to deliver on elevated consumer expectations. And it paid off as we shipped out all units within 48 hours and delivered nearly half with same-day or next-day delivery. And digital wasn't the only growth driver across greater China. Every marketplace channel grew versus last year, including year-over-year growth in traffic in our NIKE-owned stores, the first quarter to achieve this since the start of the pandemic, all while continuing to expand conversion rates versus the prior year. 
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q2 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 12% on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew more than 90% on a currency-neutral basis as we significantly expanded our digital footprint with the local launch of Nike.com in Mexico and through key digital partnerships across Mexico, Japan and Southeast Asia. We opened the first Nike Unite store globally in Korea, and this generated the highest revenue in the first 10 days of any NIKE store opening ever. Nearly 90% of transactions were linked to a member, and it's indicative of the broader engagement we are seeing across the geography and the strength of our membership offense. In December, we successfully transitioned our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model in partnership with Grupo SBF, the largest sporting goods retailer in Brazil and across Latin America. We look forward to continuing to serve our consumers in Brazil through a more efficient and profitable operating model. That being said, NIKE and Grupo Axo has mutually agreed to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKE's business in Argentina to Chile and Uruguay. We will continue to own and operate the businesses in this region in the near term, while we assess future prospects to move to a distributor model in all 3 countries. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook. Fiscal '21 continues to be dynamic, including a new wave of government restrictions implemented across Europe and parts of North America. We remain focused on what we can control, deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this challenging environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and product franchises. With that in mind, we are increasing our full year outlook for revenue and now expect low teens growth versus the prior year. In the second half, we will continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand to maintain healthy marketplace inventory amidst continued uncertainty and to ensure that we set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
Our gross margin outlook is also improving with stronger-than-planned return to normalized inventory levels and lower-than-expected markdown activity across our portfolio. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand up to 50 basis points versus the prior year, including 35 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect to continue to see quarterly sequential improvement with Q3 gross margin expansion to be roughly flat versus the prior year. For the full year, we expect SG&A will now grow low single digits, driven by increased variable costs associated with our improved revenue outlook as well as amplified investment in demand creation to further strengthen our brands and drive higher member engagement. Across gross margin and SG&A, we continue to expect approximately $315 million of nonrecurring execution costs associated with simplifying our organizational structure, of which approximately $220 million was incurred in the first half of this fiscal year. And last, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range, reflecting an increase in tax associated with finalized U.S. tax regulations. 
NIKE is navigating the current environment with an even clearer vision of our brand's long-term future, along with a sharp focus of near-term and long-term priorities. The team is highly engaged and executing with a passion to win. While we expect continued volatility in the short term due to the pandemic, a faster first half recovery has mitigated the largest operational risks. We are now better positioned to accelerate investment in our business and create even greater competitive separation as we pursue our full potential with consumers around the world. I could not be more excited about the future.

And then as you look forward to the inflection, sort of the global reopening, how are you thinking about the capacity to chase inventory, particularly in the High Heat product?"

As a starting point, as we mentioned several quarters ago, our focus has been on managing supply and demand. And we talked specifically about our focus of trying to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And so the work that we've done around the world not only to cut supply, but also to work with our marketplace partners and to try to capture and drive demand over these past 6 months has been significant in order to be able to put us in this position that we're in today. I mentioned in my remarks that we've seen markdown levels, which continue to be worse than the prior year, but better than we had anticipated and better broadly than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace, indicative of the strength of our brand. And so as we finish this quarter, the health of our inventory and the health of the inventory across the broader marketplace is exactly where we were hoping for it to be. 
As we look forward, we're obviously still in the midst of a pandemic. And so I've said a couple of quarters in a row now that we continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand management as we look at the second half. We're still in a pandemic, and we know things won't be linear until we see the pandemic and the virus under control or contained. And so what we've been focused on is ensuring that we protect the value of our brands and our product franchises and ensure that we set the company up for healthy growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and for the years after that. So that's really been what's guiding our approach. I did mention the Express Lane in my remarks, and it's a tool that we've been using around the world. It's almost 20% of our business today. It's not equally 20% across every geo. It's largest in EMEA as we've been talking about for several quarters. And it's absolutely a useful tool for us that we continue to intend to use to grow as a larger portion of our business, but also as a really critical lever to be able to manage supply and demand as we're reading the marketplace on a weekly basis. So that's going to end up being a critical component of our future as we look forward in a much more responsive way than the way we've been able to operate in the past. 
As far as High Heat product and those things, we're managing those styles and those franchises the same way we manage the rest of our franchises. And so we continue to have plans, and we use those as great tools to create brand energy in the marketplace, but also to give consumers what they love. And we're not managing those franchises any differently than we would manage any other franchises in this time. We're managing them for the long term, and that's what we will intend to do in the second half."

And we've watched wave after wave of the pandemic hit different markets and different time lines around the world. And really, the only marketplace where we've seen continued sort of trajectory in terms of managing the virus has been China. But we expect the marketplace to continue to be pretty dynamic. I think I mentioned that we're seeing waves of more restrictions happening across Europe and in parts of the U.S. And we're expecting that the situation is going to continue to be unique here as we finish the holiday season and enter into the later part of winter. However, we are looking at and have raised our guidance to low teens revenue growth because we feel like the momentum that we have, the brand strength and the playbook that we're employing is giving us confidence that we can continue to manage through this. 
As it specifically relates to what we're seeing now, our retail sales across the marketplace for holiday have continued to track very well versus the prior year. But in Europe, where we're seeing more restrictions of shutdowns, physical retail continues to be the area where we're seeing the largest impact. Stores continue to open and close on different cadences. They have to manage through traffic capacity constraints. And at this point in time, as of today, about 80% of our stores are open in EMEA, but many of them are still operating under modified and -- or reduced hours. So it's -- the situation is dynamic to say the least. We're also watching carefully potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. And to date, we've been able to continue to meet EDDs with consumers on our digital business. And we're leveraging the relationships that we have with carriers and otherwise in order to manage our business through this time. But it's definitely something that we're watching, Bob, and it's dynamic. 
I guess where I'd probably finish is just to say that we know the path isn't going to be linear, and we've been saying that for several quarters. But we think we're better positioned at this point to manage through the uncertainty probably than we were prior to the pandemic. We've learned so much over the last 9 months. And the way that we're operating as a team gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue to manage through this. And as I said earlier, we're just -- we're focused on setting a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and beyond. And so we're making decisions in the midst of the uncertainty here to do that and to position ourselves to accelerate once the pandemic's behind us."

Our store athletes, our frontline store athletes, our entire stores team and our supply chain and distribution team, they have been sort of the unsung heroes, I think, through what has been a very dynamic time. And as Matt said, while we're opening and closing physical retail, digital is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. And what's fascinating to watch is the consistency of the growth across digital. And so I think there's -- we have increasing evidence that when a consumer wants to get something, if physical retail is closed, they're coming to us digitally, and our ability to reach consumers digitally in a variety of manners is just getting better and better as this pandemic goes on."

So I'm curious, as you look at the North America wholesale outlook, is second quarter -- is it smart to think that, that might be the peak of the pullback in the near term and that drag gets a little better from here with the inventories more aligned?

And we referenced that we had to make some real-time decisions in the quarter in order to address the realities of the situation in the marketplace. And I think in the last call, I said something along the lines of -- or maybe it was 2 calls ago, I said something along the lines of, as we were adjusting forward-looking supply, we took a more aggressive action in North America because we did not believe the recovery curve in North America was going to look the same is what we expected to see in China, Asia or even in Europe, given the way that we were seeing differences in response to the -- different countries' response to the virus. And so when we got close to the second quarter and into the second quarter, we had to make some decisions about how to allocate that inventory, and we focused it on our strategic partners and serving consumer demand through NIKE Direct. And so we saw a greater reduction in undifferentiated wholesale. 
As we look forward, we're going to be more aggressive in adjusting our plans with undifferentiated wholesale. But what I would tell you is, is that we believe that we and our partners are very well positioned to capture demand that gets dislocated from changing the profile and the shape of the marketplace. And so I think looking at this quarter, I think this quarter was more indicative of the way we managed supply and demand in the face of the pandemic and the challenges that, that created in the short term versus it's an indication of trend for that line of channel of business, okay? But as we look forward, we are going to be more aggressive with larger undifferentiated customers that we have been working with. And we're working closely with our strategic wholesale partners in a city-by-city, mall-by-mall, street by street basis to work together to determine how we're going to recapture that demand. And that's absolutely our plan because we believe longer term, as we've said before, we believe that a premium, consistent experience for consumers across the marketplace connected to digital is the type of market foundation that we think we need as a premium brand to create and to be the foundation for long-term growth in the North America marketplace."

So what you saw over the last 2 quarters was more indicative of us working through the dynamics in China with inventory and those things as a result of managing through COVID versus there being an underlying theme of profit erosion long term. I think we believe that the China marketplace continues to be a great opportunity for us. And we're -- we manage the business top to bottom, Michael. So we're looking at pricing.

Our digital business has been experiencing tremendous growth, 80% globally, 100% in the U.S. Our Nike App grew 200%. Our Nike mobile app grew 200% this quarter. And I think what's underlying that is that digital is the new normal in consumer behavior, and we believe the trends that we're seeing are here to stay. In fact, as we've said now in a couple of quarters, we believe that we've well passed the 30% of our overall business, and we think it will be more in the range of 50% in the near future. And it's an area we have a clear lead. When you ask about what's driving it, again, we go back to a simple mindset: through the eyes of the consumer, which is consumers want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And that means, obviously, great digital experiences mobiley, through our apps, SNKRS and others online. But also consumers actually they don't differentiate digital and physical in the same way they used to. So they may want to buy online, pick up on store. They might want to buy online, have it shipped from store. They may want to go try it on and then have it shipped home. 
And so we are driving our digital transformation end-to-end, right? So yes, it's impacting our digital experiences. No doubt that's getting better and better and better where it's better search, better -- the digital experiences are getting better each quarter. I'll come back to membership, which I think is key. As Matt said, we're building out our stores, working with our strategic partners that offer that consistent, seamless experience that consumers expect. And frankly, the supply chain -- don't underestimate the impact of this digital on translating our supply chain. Matt talked about what we've done in Greater China. 300% increase in digital fulfillment capacity in North America, 400% in EMEA. Robots played a huge role. Over 1 million boxes shipped by robots and the productivity that comes with that. So to be a great digital company, you've got to be end-to-end. But I would say if there's one thing I'd highlight is the backbone's membership, right? Having a direct connection with consumers. And we are growing our membership. And it's simple. How do we bring more people into the top of the funnel and establish a direct connection with them? How do we engage them? Engage through them -- through engaging, whether it's NIKE Running Club, NIKE Training Club, SNKRS App, live streaming is a way to engage consumers. And what we know is more engaged consumers buy more. And one of the most, I think, exciting things we saw in the quarter was these member days where it's really the first time we have really targeted our members, provided more personal recommendations. We've allocated scarce product for them, offered them first access. And the conversion rates were very impressive. And so I think this is a virtuous cycle that if we get better and better at the whole membership funnel, the full funnel that we can have a more direct connection with consumers. We can offer more personalized and targeted offerings. I think the opportunity to expand with women digitally is significant. So it's no one thing, and I learned this from my days in the digital world. It's a lot of little things that make a difference to be a great digital company. And we're a clear leader here. I think we're extending our market share lead digitally, and we're going to continue doubling down. 
Matt, you want to take the second piece of Kimberly's question?"
291981,694795538,2164303,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 18, 2020",2020-12-18,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure. I'll just jump in on the second piece. I guess what I'd say, Kimberly, is your question specifically about the regional service center, and John sort of hit it, I mean, our focus at the start is capacity. We needed more capacity because we were",512,"Yes. Sure. I'll just jump in on the second piece. I guess what I'd say, Kimberly, is your question specifically about the regional service center, and John sort of hit it, I mean, our focus at the start is capacity. We needed more capacity because we were watching demand shift rapidly to digital. And so not only did we open that regional service center in L.A., but we leverage omnichannel capabilities in our existing distribution centers in order to be able to do the 300% or 400% increase in volume that John referenced to fuel that business. As I think about the impact on the financial model, and I've probably said this a couple of times before, but I'll use a frame that John just used, getting consumers what they want, where they want and how they want. We're investing in technology in the supply chain so that we can better predict where to put inventory where we think consumers want the inventory. And the benefits for us in that are in gross margin. It's more full price realization. It's lower cost to fulfill. And frankly, it's better for the environment because it's less shipping and it's less moving stuff around. So it's better. We're investing in technology to create O-to-O capabilities in the marketplace. And while we don't have the largest store footprint today that -- relative to maybe pure vertical retailers, we are investing in stores with the intentionality of having stores in more places with O-to-O capabilities with capabilities like buy online, pickup in store; more pickup points; shipping from store; shipping to store. So that we can serve that demand more closely to consumers, again, lower cost, better for the environment, better sustainability. 
And then I guess the last thing I'd probably hit on, and John referenced it vis-à-vis member days and the member funnel, we're investing a lot of money in digital marketing today. But the marketing -- the opportunity that we see with greater acknowledgment of who our consumers are and how they shop across the marketplace is more personalization and it's a greater return on those marketing dollars because we're moving deeper into the funnel. We know who those consumers are. And we have the ability to react and reengage them at a lower cost to us or a lower acquisition cost, which should improve -- either create leverage in our demand creation over time and/or enable us to use the dollars that we're using to drive a greater revenue plan. So those are some of the things that we're excited about. Those are -- are we seeing the fruit of it today? We're starting to. But what you are seeing, Kimberly, is we can see more clearly, though, where the biggest pockets of opportunity are. And that's where we're focused, and that's where we're investing to create capability so that we can drive these outcomes as we look several years out. So this is where we're focused as a team, and it's what's going to fuel our financial model over the next several years."

We said gross margin in the short term would be more of a function of how we manage supply and demand. And so we were more focused on the quality and health of our franchises and restoring inventory levels. And that's ultimately what drove our operating plan for the last 6 months. We're probably even more so pleased with the speed of recovery because it puts us in a position now where we can look forward and say, how do we want to manage the business as we move forward. And as I said earlier today, we're incredibly focused on the things that are required in order for us to achieve that vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. So as we look ahead, our gross margins are going to be roughly flat is what our guidance is for the third quarter, and that's another quarter of sequential improvement in margin. That's being driven by a higher full price/mix in the third quarter and lower discount activity. And that's going to be offset to some degree by factory store liquidation that we talked about last quarter, where we're still planning for more markdowns in that specific channel because we continue to see traffic lagging behind the prior year in that specific channel so that we can keep conversion rates up. 
In the third quarter, I should also say that we're going to -- we're expecting to see about 55 basis points of FX headwinds. So we've had about 30 per quarter in the first 2 quarters of this year, and we're expecting 55 basis points in Q3. And so FX adjusted, the margin looks even better sequentially. And what I'd say maybe is just a little side point on this is that we think the third quarter will end up being the trough on FX for us. So we've started to see benefits in translation on the top line. But FX has continued to be a headwind in EBIT through the second quarter, will be through the third quarter and it will lessen as we get into the fourth quarter. And then that's where we expect to start to see some inflection from a weaker U.S. dollar and strong growth outside the U.S. So I think that's probably where I'll stop. And I know our team can follow-up with you with more questions specifically on the modeling. But thanks, and happy holidays."

Before I get into our Q2 performance, I want to acknowledge the global environment right now. We continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic with surges across the U.S. and in many countries around the world. In fact, consistent with social distancing norms, Matt, Andy and I are doing this call from our homes. So if this audio sounds a little different, that's life in the Zoom world. And we're feeling optimistic with positive news on vaccines. But in the meantime, we hope everyone stays safe out there. 
Looking at Q2, our strong business results reflect our relentless focus on our objectives. I'm going to talk this quarter about the same themes I talked about last quarter and most probably next quarter, I'll talk to you about them again. The reason for this consistency is that our strategy is sound, our strategy is working, and we're excited by what we're seeing as we continue to execute it. In Q2, we returned to growth of 9% on a reported basis. This revenue improvement reflects currency-neutral growth across all of our geographies, NIKE Digital up 80% globally and women's growth outpacing our overall growth. 
But beyond any one quarter's results, the clear momentum we have right now is evidence of our product innovation and brand strength that allows us to connect with consumers worldwide. I've said it before, these are times when strong brands get stronger. The structural tailwinds we're seeing, including permitted shifts toward digital, athletic wear and health and wellness, continue to offer us incredible opportunity. And of course, as organized sport returns around the world, that energy creates yet another tailwind for NIKE. For example, we were excited to see so many runners participating in the Shanghai Marathon 2 weeks ago. 
Speaking of Greater China, the growth we saw there in Q2 was evidence of the progress we've made toward our end-to-end digital transformation, which allows us to better manage volatility and deliver strong growth. As a result, in Q2, Greater China grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis and 24% on a reported basis. Our success in Greater China was also driven by a triumphant Singles' Day, in which NIKE yet again was the #1 sports brand with the highest store demand and highest traffic on Tmall. This growth underscores how we engage with consumers on Singles' Day, bringing more than 4 million new members to NIKE. Overall, Singles' Day drove more than $0.5 billion in digital demand. 
More broadly, this holiday season also was highlighted by the record-setting digital sales we saw during Black Friday week, which has shown the power of our digital transformation all over the globe. Digital is now woven into everything we do as a company. It's how we operate and prioritize, from how we engage with members, to how we operate our supply chain, to how we serve consumers in the marketplace. 
Today, I'd like to focus on 2 key areas of increasing competitive advantage for us: Our leadership in innovation and our incredible brand momentum. Let's start with product and innovation. Innovation has always been our lifeblood at NIKE. It's what continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our return to growth this quarter was fueled by our relentless innovation pipeline. In the last 90 days, we've introduced exciting products at an impressive pace, and this will continue going forward. Through innovation, we are serving consumers in ways no other brand can. We're using digital to connect product to consumers like never before. We're bringing more athletes into sport through inclusivity, and we're scaling sustainable materials further in our product portfolio. 
This quarter's launches in basketball, including the LeBron 18 and the Kyrie 7, have sold incredibly well. I'm particularly excited that both were launched digital first. The LeBron 18 was introduced in September through an integrated live stream with Tencent in Greater China, driving deeper connection to local hoops culture. And we launched the Kyrie 7 by announcing 4 colorways available only as mystery repurchases through the SNKRS App. 
In women's, our M Maternity Collection is connecting with consumers in the marketplace with 100% sell-through of tights in the first 2 days. Due to high consumer demand for our new maternity wear, we're bringing more units into the marketplace and rolling out more content and inspiration for women pre and post partum on our activity apps. This is a great example of how we start with product and then scale further through engagement to deepen our connection with consumers. 
We also grow sport through inclusivity. For example, we continue to extend our size offerings as we give more consumers access to sport. For example, in women's, we now have more than 100 styles of extended sized apparel across NIKE and Jordan, and we will continue to further increase our offering. And this quarter, we launched extended sizing in our kids business in North America with a plan to increase to 25% of our kids assortment next summer. 
Finally, sustainability will always be core to our innovation efforts. 85% of our recently launched ACG apparel collection contains more than 90% recycled materials. And we'll also continue to scale sustainability through our sportwear icons. In fact, just this past quarter, we launched our new sustainable Crater Foam in both Air Force 1 and Waffle Racer. The demand for these products and more shows that consumer hunger for sustainability continues to accelerate. 
We are proud of this innovation pipeline, and we have no plans to slow down. In coming quarters, new innovations will include exciting new women's product in Jordan Brand, a new learning style designed to help reduce injury and our first performance shoe in our sustainable footwear platform. Innovation differentiates NIKE. We don't settle for the lead, and our ability to innovate remains unrivaled. It's so fundamental to us that we increased our investment in innovation during the uncertainty of the pandemic to create even further separation. This is how NIKE stays in the lead. 
Moving to our brand strength. Our deep connection with consumers through authentic brand moments at global scale also continues to expand our leadership position. As I said earlier, the strong are getting stronger, and our scale is unmatched. In Q2, NIKE generated over 7 billion brand impressions across social platforms globally, directly connecting with consumers on the platforms where they spend their time. For example, our Never Too Far Down film became the #1 ad that consumers chose to watch on YouTube during 2020. And these touch points led to over 400 million social engagements. It's clear we're not just reaching our consumers, we're creating dialogue and opportunities for action that continue to exceed our own internal benchmarks. 
This deep and meaningful connection has a direct result, a NIKE membership. Since the pandemic began, we've added more than 70 million new members globally. And we're deeply focused on the member funnel outcomes, including new member buying, reactivation and retention, and it's working. Importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new and active member growth. And growth in member demand is outpacing total digital growth. 
As we drive our membership efforts, we continue to innovate how we serve members. This quarter, NIKE hosted our first-ever globally coordinated member days, which demonstrate how we continue to create value for NIKE members. This unique retail moment offers first access to product, rewards for activity and exclusives across stores and digital. This event reached over 60 million members across 25 countries, driving higher engagement and conversion metrics for the quarter. 
And in Q2, we once again used the SNKRS App to push digital retail to the next level. SNKRS remains one of NIKE's greatest competitive advantages, delivering truly innovative features for consumers. For example, this quarter, we launched SNKRS live with our first-ever product drop via live streaming, resulting in a 100% sell-through of the Air Jordan 4 PSG in under 2 minutes. This live streaming capability is now fully launched in both North America and EMEA with plans to expand in Japan. Live interaction creates stronger member engagement with NIKE, giving them better access to our best products and experiences. We see so much value here that we opened a brand-new live streaming studio in Greater China just in time for Singles' Day. 
Simply put, the NIKE brand is strong. We have a scale that's unparalleled, and the brand is creating meaningful connections everywhere the Swoosh exists. Just look at our results this quarter. Our brands power this year has been second to none. 
Before I wrap up, I want to give a little more context for a number I mentioned earlier, our 80% NIKE Digital growth this quarter. We've now had 3 straight quarters of roughly 80% digital growth. As we've said, this growth won't always be so uniform, but we are growing the pie and taking share from competition. This is the sharp point of our strategy. The consumer shift to digital is permanent, and our digital penetration will only increase in years to come. 
Across the quarter, our innovation pipeline and brand strength positioned us to continue to navigate a dynamic environment with agility. We have a proven playbook, led by digital. The foundation of this playbook is our commitment to product and consumer connection. The fundamental truth of NIKE is that our innovation and brand strength continue to set the pace. 
Now Matt will give you more detail on our playbook. But before he does, I'd like to finish by saluting our teams around the globe. Since the start of the pandemic, we've said that we would stay on the offense, and the credit for that continued effort and execution goes to our team. Around the world in every facet of our business and our organization, they continue to demonstrate commitment, resilience and creativity. I could not be prouder of everyone on the NIKE team, and I genuinely thank them. 
And now I'll turn things over to Matt."

As I said in our last call, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by our unparalleled brand momentum and sharp focus on operational execution. Consumer engagement with our brands continues to grow in frequency and depth through the power of our product franchises and fresh storytelling delivered through improved digital and physical experiences. 
Our financial results in the second quarter and for the first half of fiscal '21 are proof that NIKE has recovered and is moving forward. We have a new consumer offense and a clear vision for how we will engage and serve consumer demand for our brands through digital, leveraging a technology-enabled operating model, which is being built for greater speed, efficiency and effectiveness. While uncertainty due to the global pandemic persists, our teams are now better equipped than ever to navigate through the dynamics we face. We continue to leverage our operational playbook, and we learn more every week. Our leadership momentum and trajectory in Greater China is helping to shape decisions we are making around the rest of the world. Our teams are sharply focused on the key metrics that matter most to accelerate the pace of our recovery and return to sustainable, profitable growth. 
In June, we set clear measures of success for the first half of this fiscal year, and now 6 months later, we've exceeded those goals. Let me share a few of the highlights. We said inventory would return to a healthy and normalized level by the end of Q2. And now through intentional supply and demand management actions, marketplace health has been restored across all geographies without compromising the value of our brands and product franchises. And NIKE-owned inventory is clean, ending Q2 down 2% versus prior year while delivering 9% revenue growth on a reported basis. We said that digital acceleration brought on by COVID-19 was indicative of a new future marketplace and not a temporary phenomenon. In Q1, we exceeded our digital penetration goal of 30% across owned and partnered, almost 3 years earlier than planned. Now in Q2, our momentum continues with 80% NIKE Digital revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we increased our digital penetration further by improving product availability through search optimization, moving inventory across marketplace channels and increasing digital fulfillment capacity through scale and automation. 
We said we would tightly manage costs, and in the first half of fiscal '21, SG&A declined 6% versus prior year. Over the course of the last 6 months, we have reduced discretionary spending in nonpriority areas while accelerating investment to support our digital transformation and realigning our organization to a new consumer construct. And finally, we said our product pipeline would remain robust. And you've seen us continue a consistent flow of innovation and new storytelling around our most important product franchises. This has translated into deep consumer engagement with our brands and market share gains, driving first half revenue growth of 4% versus the prior year. Simply put, we have executed on our plan, and NIKE is now even better positioned to compete and serve consumers than prior to the pandemic. 
Now as we look ahead to the second half of fiscal '21 and beyond, I want to share some perspective on how we will strategically and financially manage the company. You've heard me talk about these principles before, and I will continue to reiterate them as we execute against our strategy and transform our business. First and foremost, despite the short-term uncertainty, we are managing the business and making decisions for the long term. Consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, and NIKE's market opportunity is as large as ever. While short-term consumer demand may continue to be impacted, we are focused on moving faster against the most important elements to position NIKE for the long term: deepening relationships our 3 brands have with consumers, scaling direct connections with contactable members, expanding capabilities to manage a rapidly growing digital business and transforming and elevating the marketplace. 
Second, we will continue to optimize supply and demand with speed and agility, maintaining healthy inventory levels and increasing full price realization. Capabilities like Express Lane, now operationalized in all 4 geographies and representing almost 20% of our total business, enables increased flexibility and responsiveness in serving consumer demand while driving higher profitability. Third, we will capitalize on the relative speed of our recovery and our financial strength by accelerating investment levels from the first half. Our investment priorities will be focused on a few key areas. We will begin to rebuild investment in demand creation, activating against major sports moments, athletes and innovation and expanding the reach and impact of significant growth opportunities in women's, apparel, digital and our Jordan Brand. 
We expect demand creation as a percentage of revenue will gradually increase versus recent quarters, although new capabilities and a member-focused digital marketing model will enable greater return on investment over time. We will create a digital-first supply chain, built on a strong technology and analytics foundation in order to optimize service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We already see return on our investments in North America, where we ramped up our new regional service center in Los Angeles to serve peak holiday demand, aided by capabilities from our Celect acquisition. As a result, we delivered over 100% NIKE Digital revenue growth in Q2 in North America while lowering digital fulfillment cost per unit versus the prior year. We will accelerate the technology enablement of our operating model to change the speed with which we directly engage with and serve the consumer from online to off-line services, digital marketing, personalization and digital supply and demand management. 
In North America, we leveraged new tools to make dynamic pricing decisions during Black Friday. We also continue to scale RFID capabilities across our stores in EMEA, enabling better product allocation and replenishment, and we began testing consumer-facing RFID capabilities like self-checkout in our stores in Korea. In the marketplace, we will increase the pace of opening new stores as we create an elevated, differentiated and digitally connected experience for our consumers. In Q2 alone, we opened 2 Nike Live and 6 Nike Unite stores, which is our next-generation factory store concept. And we plan to open an additional 30 stores in the second half of this fiscal year and even more in fiscal year '22, enabling accelerated growth in women's digital and apparel. 
And finally, we will drive strong free cash flow growth and consistent balance sheet management as we target leverage down towards pre-pandemic levels. We recently announced a 12% increase in our annual dividend, and when appropriate, we'll resume share repurchase activity. The underlying benefits from our business shift towards NIKE Digital and NIKE Direct are becoming increasingly clear, and these principles will enable us to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. 
Now let's turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 9% in Q2, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis; as NIKE Direct grew 30%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth of 80% and partially offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q2 versus the prior year, resulting from higher promotional activity to reduce excess inventories. Performance in the quarter was impacted by nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment, which reduced gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. 
SG&A declined 2% in the quarter as disciplined expense management and lower marketing spend on brand and sports events was partially offset by increased investments in digital marketing. This quarter, SG&A was also negatively impacted by approximately $135 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 10.7% for the same period last year, primarily due to changes in our earnings mix and an increase in tax associated with recently finalized U.S. tax regulations and increased benefits from stock compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.78, up 11% versus the prior year. 
With that, let's turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 1% and includes noncomparable items in the prior year, such as the sale of Hurley and the transition of our NFL license business to fanatics. And Q2 EBIT increased 17% on a reported basis. Q2 provided more clear evidence on the state of our marketplace transformation and shift in channel mix. Despite a 14% decline in wholesale revenue and traffic in NIKE-owned stores remaining well below prior year levels, North America was able to grow 1% overall due to more than 100% growth in NIKE Digital. NIKE Digital now represents nearly 25% of our North America business, and it continues to serve a broader consumer base. In Q2, member days drove records for weekly member metrics and engagement with strong NIKE Digital performance in women's, apparel and sub-$100 product, all areas of significant growth opportunity. 
Within wholesale, we continue to shift the marketplace towards differentiated retail. And to give you some context on our progress leading up to the pandemic, over the last 3 years, we have reduced the number of undifferentiated accounts in North America by roughly 30% while still delivering mid-single-digit growth on average. And in Q2, as we manage product supply in response to the pandemic, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocations to benefit our strategic partners and NIKE Direct. As a result, undifferentiated wholesale revenue declined at an even faster rate compared to total wholesale. Looking forward, over the next 2 years, we will more aggressively accelerate change with larger undifferentiated accounts as we and our strategic partners together reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture short-term demand dislocation. 
In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 29% on a reported basis. Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions in November, EMEA continued to drive momentum in Q2 through strong weekly sales growth and a higher full price realization. NIKE Direct grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis. And wholesale grew 6% in the quarter, led by strong double-digit strategic partner growth in JD Sports and Zalando, partially offset by double-digit declines in undifferentiated wholesale. NIKE Digital grew nearly 100% driven by Cyber Week that broke records across revenue and member engagement. In our NIKE-owned stores, we continued expansion of services to consumers. We piloted virtual experts sessions at NikeTown London, driving increases in conversion and basket size, with plans to scale this capability across EMEA. And we utilized digital queuing and additional self-checkout options to improve the consumer experience and safety. 
Our Express Lane offense in EMEA once again drove significant growth in Q2, increasing more than 30% versus the prior year. This is a key enabler to navigating the current environment through a more flexible inventory strategy. We lowered futures bookings for holiday and leveraged Express Lane to replenish inventory on a significantly shorter lead time and responding to current retail trends. And with the recent lockdown measures announced this week, we will be agile in managing ongoing uncertainty by leveraging our operational playbook. 
With that, let's turn to Greater China, which achieved its first $2 billion quarter and grew an incredible 19% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2 with EBIT growth of 28% on a reported basis. As John mentioned earlier, Singles' Day drove significant growth in the quarter with over $0.5 billion in digital demand. In order to fulfill the record level of orders, we implemented several initiatives to maximize flexibility and responsiveness in our supply chain. From enabling multi-node network fulfillment to employing robot delivery and green packaging, the Greater China team was prepared to deliver on elevated consumer expectations. And it paid off as we shipped out all units within 48 hours and delivered nearly half with same-day or next-day delivery. And digital wasn't the only growth driver across greater China. Every marketplace channel grew versus last year, including year-over-year growth in traffic in our NIKE-owned stores, the first quarter to achieve this since the start of the pandemic, all while continuing to expand conversion rates versus the prior year. 
Finally, in our APLA geography, Q2 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 12% on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew more than 90% on a currency-neutral basis as we significantly expanded our digital footprint with the local launch of Nike.com in Mexico and through key digital partnerships across Mexico, Japan and Southeast Asia. We opened the first Nike Unite store globally in Korea, and this generated the highest revenue in the first 10 days of any NIKE store opening ever. Nearly 90% of transactions were linked to a member, and it's indicative of the broader engagement we are seeing across the geography and the strength of our membership offense. In December, we successfully transitioned our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model in partnership with Grupo SBF, the largest sporting goods retailer in Brazil and across Latin America. 
We look forward to continuing to serve our consumers in Brazil through a more efficient and profitable operating model. That being said, NIKE and Grupo Axo has mutually agreed to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKE's business in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. We will continue to own and operate the businesses in this region in the near term, while we assess future prospects to move to a distributor model in all 3 countries. 
I will now turn to our financial outlook. Fiscal '21 continues to be dynamic, including a new wave of government restrictions implemented across Europe and parts of North America. We remain focused on what we can control, deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this challenging environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and product franchises. With that in mind, we are increasing our full year outlook for revenue and now expect low teens growth versus the prior year. In the second half, we will continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand to maintain healthy marketplace inventory amidst continued uncertainty and to ensure that we set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and beyond. 
Our gross margin outlook is also improving with stronger-than-planned return to normalized inventory levels and lower-than-expected markdown activity across our portfolio. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand up to 50 basis points versus the prior year, including 35 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect to continue to see quarterly sequential improvement with Q3 gross margin expansion to be roughly flat versus the prior year. For the full year, we expect SG&A will now grow low single digits, driven by increased variable costs associated with our improved revenue outlook as well as amplified investment in demand creation to further strengthen our brands and drive higher member engagement. Across gross margin and SG&A, we continue to expect approximately $315 million of nonrecurring execution costs associated with simplifying our organizational structure, of which approximately $220 million was incurred in the first half of this fiscal year. And last, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range, reflecting an increase in tax associated with finalized U.S. tax regulations. 
NIKE is navigating the current environment with an even clearer vision of our brand's long-term future, along with a sharp focus of near-term and long-term priorities. The team is highly engaged and executing with a passion to win. While we expect continued volatility in the short term due to the pandemic, a faster first half recovery has mitigated the largest operational risks. We are now better positioned to accelerate investment in our business and create even greater competitive separation as we pursue our full potential with consumers around the world. I could not be more excited about the future.

And we talked specifically about our focus of trying to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And so the work that we've done around the world not only to cut supply, but also to work with our marketplace partners and to try to capture and drive demand over these past 6 months has been significant in order to be able to put us in this position that we're in today. I mentioned in my remarks that we've seen markdown levels, which continue to be worse than the prior year, but better than we had anticipated and better broadly than what we're seeing across the rest of the marketplace, indicative of the strength of our brand. And so as we finish this quarter, the health of our inventory and the health of the inventory across the broader marketplace is exactly where we were hoping for it to be. 
As we look forward, we're obviously still in the midst of a pandemic. And so I've said a couple of quarters in a row now that we continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand management as we look at the second half. We're still in a pandemic, and we know things won't be linear until we see the pandemic and the virus under control or contained. And so what we've been focused on is ensuring that we protect the value of our brands and our product franchises and ensure that we set the company up for healthy growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and for the years after that. So that's really been what's guiding our approach. 
I did mention the Express Lane in my remarks, and it's a tool that we've been using around the world. It's almost 20% of our business today. It's not equally 20% across every geo. It's largest in EMEA as we've been talking about for several quarters. And it's absolutely a useful tool for us that we continue to intend to use to grow as a larger portion of our business, but also as a really critical lever to be able to manage supply and demand as we're reading the marketplace on a weekly basis. So that's going to end up being a critical component of our future as we look forward in a much more responsive way than the way we've been able to operate in the past. 
As far as High Heat product and those things, we're managing those styles and those franchises the same way we manage the rest of our franchises. And so we continue to have plans, and we use those as great tools to create brand energy in the marketplace, but also to give consumers what they love. And we're not managing those franchises any differently than we would manage any other franchises in this time. We're managing them for the long term, and that's what we will intend to do in the second half."

And we've watched wave after wave of the pandemic hit different markets and different time lines around the world. And really, the only marketplace where we've seen continued sort of trajectory in terms of managing the virus has been China. But we expect the marketplace to continue to be pretty dynamic. I think I mentioned that we're seeing waves of more restrictions happening across Europe and in parts of the U.S. And we're expecting that the situation is going to continue to be unique here as we finish the holiday season and enter into the later part of winter. However, we are looking at and have raised our guidance to low teens revenue growth because we feel like the momentum that we have, the brand strength and the playbook that we're employing is giving us confidence that we can continue to manage through this. 
As it specifically relates to what we're seeing now, our retail sales across the marketplace for holiday have continued to track very well versus the prior year. But in Europe, where we're seeing more restrictions of shutdowns, physical retail continues to be the area where we're seeing the largest impact. Stores continue to open and close on different cadences. They have to manage through traffic capacity constraints. And at this point in time, as of today, about 80% of our stores are open in EMEA, but many of them are still operating under modified and -- or reduced hours. So it's -- the situation is dynamic to say the least. We're also watching carefully potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. And to date, we've been able to continue to meet EDDs with consumers on our digital business. And we're leveraging the relationships that we have with carriers and otherwise in order to manage our business through this time. But it's definitely something that we're watching, Bob, and it's dynamic. 
I guess where I'd probably finish is just to say that we know the path isn't going to be linear, and we've been saying that for several quarters. But we think we're better positioned at this point to manage through the uncertainty probably than we were prior to the pandemic. We've learned so much over the last 9 months. And the way that we're operating as a team gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue to manage through this. And as I said earlier, we're just -- we're focused on setting a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year '22 and beyond. And so we're making decisions in the midst of the uncertainty here to do that and to position ourselves to accelerate once the pandemic is behind us."

Our store athletes, our frontline store athletes, our entire stores team and our supply chain and distribution team, they have been sort of the unsung heroes, I think, through what has been a very dynamic time. And as Matt said, while we're opening and closing physical retail, digital is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. And what's fascinating to watch is the consistency of the growth across digital. And so I think there's -- we have increasing evidence that when a consumer wants to get something, if physical retail is closed, they're coming to us digitally, and our ability to reach consumers digitally in a variety of manners is just getting better and better as this pandemic goes on."

And you did talk about accelerating the strategy and transforming the end markets, but I know there was a very purposeful focus on getting the inventories aligned. So I'm curious, as you look at the North America wholesale outlook, is second quarter -- is it smart to think that, that might be the peak of the pullback in the near term and that drag gets a little better from here with the inventories more aligned? Or would you say that to think about it still being down at that level as you go forward as you kind of keep working on the marketplace?"

And we referenced that we had to make some real-time decisions in the quarter in order to address the realities of the situation in the marketplace. And I think in the last call, I said something along the lines of -- or maybe it was 2 calls ago, I said something along the lines of, as we were adjusting forward-looking supply, we took a more aggressive action in North America because we did not believe the recovery curve in North America was going to look the same is what we expected to see in China, Asia or even in Europe, given the way that we were seeing differences in response to the -- different countries' response to the virus. 
And so when we got close to the second quarter and into the second quarter, we had to make some decisions about how to allocate that inventory, and we focused it on our strategic partners and serving consumer demand through NIKE Direct. And so we saw a greater reduction in undifferentiated wholesale. As we look forward, we're going to be more aggressive in adjusting our plans with undifferentiated wholesale. But what I would tell you is, is that we believe that we and our partners are very well positioned to capture demand that gets dislocated from changing the profile and the shape of the marketplace. And so I think looking at this quarter, I think this quarter was more indicative of the way we managed supply and demand in the face of the pandemic and the challenges that, that created in the short term versus it's an indication of trend for that line of channel of business, okay? 
But as we look forward, we are going to be more aggressive with larger undifferentiated customers that we have been working with. And we're working closely with our strategic wholesale partners in a city-by-city, mall-by-mall, street by street basis to work together to determine how we're going to recapture that demand. And that's absolutely our plan because we believe longer term, as we've said before, we believe that a premium, consistent experience for consumers across the marketplace connected to digital is the type of market foundation that we think we need as a premium brand to create and to be the foundation for long-term growth in the North America marketplace."

So what you saw over the last 2 quarters was more indicative of us working through the dynamics in China with inventory and those things as a result of managing through COVID versus there being an underlying theme of profit erosion long term. I think we believe that the China marketplace continues to be a great opportunity for us. And we're -- we manage the business top to bottom, Michael. So we're looking at pricing.

And I think what's underlying that is that digital is the new normal in consumer behavior, and we believe the trends that we're seeing are here to stay. In fact, as we've said now in a couple of quarters, we believe that we've well passed the 30% of our overall business, and we think it will be more in the range of 50% in the near future. And it's an area we have a clear lead. 
When you ask about what's driving it, again, we go back to a simple mindset: through the eyes of the consumer, which is consumers want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And that means, obviously, great digital experiences mobiley through our apps, SNKRS and others online. But also consumers actually they don't differentiate digital and physical in the same way they used to. So they may want to buy online, pick up on store. They might want to buy online, have it shipped from store. They may want to go try it on and then have it shipped home. 
And so we are driving our digital transformation end-to-end, right? So yes, it's impacting our digital experiences. No doubt that's getting better and better and better where it's better search, better -- the digital experiences are getting better each quarter. I'll come back to membership, which I think is key. As Matt said, we're building out our stores, working with our strategic partners that offer that consistent, seamless experience that consumers expect. And frankly, the supply chain -- don't underestimate the impact of this digital on translating our supply chain. Matt talked about what we've done in Greater China. 300% increase in digital fulfillment capacity in North America, 400% in EMEA. Robots played a huge role. Over 1 million boxes shipped by robots and the productivity that comes with that. So to be a great digital company, you've got to be end-to-end. 
But I would say if there's one thing I'd highlight is the backbone's membership, right? Having a direct connection with consumers. And we are growing our membership. And it's simple. How do we bring more people into the top of the funnel and establish a direct connection with them? How do we engage them? Engage through them -- through engaging, whether it's Nike Running Club, Nike Training Club, SNKRS App, live streaming is a way to engage consumers. And what we know is more engaged consumers buy more. And one of the most, I think, exciting things we saw in the quarter was these member days where it's really the first time we have really targeted our members, provided more personal recommendations. We've allocated scarce product for them, offered them first access. And the conversion rates were very impressive. 
And so I think this is a virtuous cycle that if we get better and better at the whole membership funnel, the full funnel that we can have a more direct connection with consumers. We can offer more personalized and targeted offerings. I think the opportunity to expand with women digitally is significant. So it's no one thing, and I learned this from my days in the digital world. It's a lot of little things that make a difference to be a great digital company. And we're a clear leader here. I think we're extending our market share lead digitally, and we're going to continue doubling down. 
Matt, you want to take the second piece of Kimberly's question?"
291981,694795538,2164311,"NIKE, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Dec 18, 2020",2020-12-18,"Earnings Calls","NIKE, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure. I'll just jump in on the second piece. I guess what I'd say, Kimberly, is your question specifically about the regional service center, and John sort of hit it, I mean, our focus at the start is capacity. We needed more capacity because we were",512,"Yes. Sure. I'll just jump in on the second piece. I guess what I'd say, Kimberly, is your question specifically about the regional service center, and John sort of hit it, I mean, our focus at the start is capacity. We needed more capacity because we were watching demand shift rapidly to digital. And so not only did we open that regional service center in L.A., but we leverage omnichannel capabilities in our existing distribution centers in order to be able to do the 300% or 400% increase in volume that John referenced to fuel that business. As I think about the impact on the financial model, and I've probably said this a couple of times before, but I'll use a frame that John just used, getting consumers what they want, where they want and how they want. We're investing in technology in the supply chain so that we can better predict where to put inventory where we think consumers want the inventory. And the benefits for us in that are in gross margin. It's more full price realization. It's lower cost to fulfill. And frankly, it's better for the environment because it's less shipping and it's less moving stuff around. So it's better. 
We're investing in technology to create O2O capabilities in the marketplace. And while we don't have the largest store footprint today that -- relative to maybe pure vertical retailers, we are investing in stores with the intentionality of having stores in more places with O2O capabilities with capabilities like buy online, pickup in store; more pickup points; shipping from store; shipping to store. So that we can serve that demand more closely to consumers, again, lower cost, better for the environment, better sustainability. 
And then I guess the last thing I'd probably hit on, and John referenced it vis-à-vis member days and the member funnel, we're investing a lot of money in digital marketing today. But the marketing -- the opportunity that we see with greater acknowledgment of who our consumers are and how they shop across the marketplace is more personalization and it's a greater return on those marketing dollars because we're moving deeper into the funnel. We know who those consumers are. And we have the ability to react and reengage them at a lower cost to us or a lower acquisition cost, which should improve -- either create leverage in our demand creation over time and/or enable us to use the dollars that we're using to drive a greater revenue plan. 
So those are some of the things that we're excited about. Those are -- are we seeing the fruit of it today? We're starting to. But what you are seeing, Kimberly, is we can see more clearly, though, where the biggest pockets of opportunity are. And that's where we're focused, and that's where we're investing to create capability so that we can drive these outcomes as we look several years out. So this is where we're focused as a team, and it's what's going to fuel our financial model over the next several years."

We said gross margin in the short term would be more of a function of how we manage supply and demand. And so we were more focused on the quality and health of our franchises and restoring inventory levels. And that's ultimately what drove our operating plan for the last 6 months. We're probably even more so pleased with the speed of recovery because it puts us in a position now where we can look forward and say, how do we want to manage the business as we move forward. And as I said earlier today, we're incredibly focused on the things that are required in order for us to achieve that vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. 
So as we look ahead, our gross margins are going to be roughly flat is what our guidance is for the third quarter, and that's another quarter of sequential improvement in margin. That's being driven by a higher full price/mix in the third quarter and lower discount activity. And that's going to be offset to some degree by factory store liquidation that we talked about last quarter, where we're still planning for more markdowns in that specific channel because we continue to see traffic lagging behind the prior year in that specific channel so that we can keep conversion rates up. 
In the third quarter, I should also say that we're going to -- we're expecting to see about 55 basis points of FX headwinds. So we've had about 30 per quarter in the first 2 quarters of this year, and we're expecting 55 basis points in Q3. And so FX adjusted, the margin looks even better sequentially. And what I'd say maybe as just a little side point on this is that we think the third quarter will end up being the trough on FX for us. So we've started to see benefits in translation on the top line. But FX has continued to be a headwind in EBIT through the second quarter and will be through the third quarter and it will lessen as we get into the fourth quarter. And then that's where we expect to start to see some inflection from a weaker U.S. dollar and strong growth outside the U.S. 
So I think that's probably where I'll stop. And I know our team can follow-up with you with more questions specifically on the modeling. But thanks, and happy holidays."
