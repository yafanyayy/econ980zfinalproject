First, I want to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. In 2019, our employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history. The very successful restructuring of our Home furniture business, where we are already seeing an EBIT margin benefit, the orderly closure of our fashion bed business and successful liquidation of that inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on deleveraging. Generating record cash from operations and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our employees across the company. And these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all. As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discuss changes to our segment structure. These changes align with how we manage our businesses. Effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding related businesses, including our innerspring and specialty foam businesses our steel rod and wire and machinery businesses and our adjustable bed business will be 1 Bedding product segment. This optimizes efficiency and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of Rod, wire, spring specialty foam. The newly formed Furniture, Flooring and Textile products segment will contain our home and work furniture businesses, our flooring products business and our fabric converting and geo components businesses. Our specialized products segment is not changing and includes our automotive, aerospace and hydraulic cylinder businesses. The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020 earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing 5 years of historical segment data based upon the new segment reporting structure. We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance. Four-year sales grew 11%, EBIT grew 18% and adjusted EBIT grew 12%. Full year EPS was $2.47, and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end. We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material cost, primarily steel scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings along with corresponding movements in LIFO benefit or expense. We passed our steel cost increases or decreases along to our customers after an approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag in the first half of 2019, our selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018. At the same time, our cost for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars were increasing and earnings benefited from the lower cost. 
In the second half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap cost along to our rod wire and innerspring customers. Despite downward effect of our -- on our sales dollars, we continue to experience earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased earnings from LIFO benefit as steel costs deflated. Steel scrap costs began to rise in November 2019 and have continued inflating through January of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020 and anticipate negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had a $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel scrap and rod and our full year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from foam chemical deflation in our ECS business that I will discuss later in the call. 
Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume and 3% from raw material-related price decreases and a negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3% and continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was up 2%. We are pleased with the performance of our Bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. spring sales were up 7%. International Spring sales were up 4%, and adjustable bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our Automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our Aerospace business was up 11% in the quarter. Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased $20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit and improved earnings performance in furniture products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%. Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate. 
For the full year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to sales. Organic sales were down 3% on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from increases implemented in late 2018 were offset by a negative currency impact. 
Full year organic sales growth in most of our businesses, including U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture and Aerospace was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3% and weak trade demand in steel rod and wire. Volume was flat for the year, absent declines from exited business. 
Content gains continued to drive sales growth in both our Bedding and Automotive businesses in 2019. U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher value innersprings. Our automotive sales were up 2% for the year, with global auto production down 6%. Full year EBIT increased $76 million and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million or 12% to $529 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefits, and improved earnings performance in our Furniture Products segment. Full year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.57. Adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate. 
In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions and gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology along with scale in the production of private label finished mattresses. ECS' full year 2019 sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-bedding markets. Volume was up 11%. 
As expected, ECS' EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and their cash flow generation is strong. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring and related charges were $15 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete. 
In November, the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to a successful conclusion with the International Trade Commission, making a unanimous final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws. Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to him."

In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction in working capital across the company and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses, including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018. In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $279 million. In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats. 
Consistent with our deleveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full year, we repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrendered for employee benefit plans at an average price of $44.2. We issued 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. From an acquisition perspective during the year, we acquired ECS and 1 small geo component operations. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $143 million, 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending. 
Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and continue to expect to delever to a ratio of debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisitions and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the 11% to 14% target in both 2017 as well as 2018 but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those same years, the TSR, the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent 3-year performance did not meet our top third goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time. 
Now moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance. 2020 sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019 should add 1% to sales growth in 2020. Raw material-related price decreases implemented in the second half of 2019 should at lower sales 1%. We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes Automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, Aerospace, Geo Components and Work Furniture. We also expect the growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases from planned exited volume in both Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, as well as continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. So absent exited business, volume is expected to be flat to up 4%. 2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting earnings growth in our Automotive, Bedding and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel cost, including the nonrecurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit. Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because of investments we're making to support the growth, security and continuity of the company. These investments include network and cybersecurity upgrades and personnel to support those activities. We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology. 
Finally, employee benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan. Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect 2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million, net interest expense of approximately $80 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. 
Based upon this guidance framework, our 2020 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%. Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends should require $220 million of cash. 
Finally, we know impacts from the Corona virus are top of mind for many of you, and we are closely monitoring global development. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees around the world. For our employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdowns in accordance with Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We're establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese facilities to better protect our 5,200 employees in China when they can return to work. And for all Leggett & Platt employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are severely restricting all international travel. We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our business, including demand for our business and our customers goods, inventory availability throughout our supply chain as well as our customer supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce availability. We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this Corona virus to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- and other global manufacturers. We continue to monitor the situation and will take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

But what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed until November, where we saw the first move-up in scrap. So we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December and then $30 a ton in January. So we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that as prices deflated in 2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We're flipping that situation in 2020. But because of the kind of the auditees of year-end, we actually are -- decreased our customer prices in January of 2020 because we adjust every quarter, so we're -- those contracts actually in the face of our increase in input cost, we lower prices because of lag effect. We will be increasing our customers' prices starting in April. So with that, there is a LIFO swing. There is 0 impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck knows, to your point. So that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint, from a trade market perspective, again, this is trade. So think of us for about the 25% of the total tons that we produce from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we're like them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad because of the deflation cycle. But the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro U.S. economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution. So people may question, well, wait a second, the steel -- U.S. steel industry was protected by Trump tariffs last year, while the products weren't so there was a continued inflow of products in an environment where export demand was very, very soft. So from a trade perspective, that's really what happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but steel moves are really, really complex."

And then in the second half of the year to be up slightly. And so the stuff that he was talking about, and you guys have alluded to. There's more impact from the excess volume in the first half of the year. We've got the flip from deflation to inflation by the second half of the year, we expect to have anniversaried most of the exit volume. So that's on the sales side. On the earnings side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest of the year, and that gets to the steel lag that  Karl was talking about a slip on the steel side. And then for the full year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly versus each quarter in 2019 and then for the full year of 2019."

First, I want to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. In 2019, our employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history; the very successful restructuring of our Home Furniture business, where we are already seeing an EBIT margin benefit; the orderly closure of our Fashion Bed business and successful liquidation of that inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on deleveraging; generating record cash from operations; and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our employees across the company. And these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all. 
As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to our segment structure. 
These changes align with how we manage our businesses. Effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding-related businesses, including our innerspring and Specialty Foam businesses, our Steel Rod and wire and Machinery businesses and our Adjustable Bed business, will be 1 Bedding Products segment. This optimizes efficiency and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of rod, wire, spring specialty foam. 
The newly formed Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment will contain our Home and Work Furniture businesses, our Flooring Products business and our Fabric Converting and Geo Components businesses. Our Specialized Products segment is not changing and includes our Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinder (sic) [ Hydraulic Cylinders ] businesses. 
The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020 earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing 5 years of historical segment data based upon the new segment reporting structure. 
We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance: 4 sales grew 11%; EBIT grew 18% and adjusted EBIT grew 12%; full year EPS was $2.47; and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end. 
We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material cost, primarily steel scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings, along with corresponding movements in LIFO benefit or expense. We passed our steel cost increases or decreases along to our customers after an approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag, in the first half of 2019, our selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018. At the same time, our cost for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars were increasing and earnings benefited from the lower cost. 
In the second half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap cost along to our rod wire and innerspring customers. Despite downward effect of our -- on our sales dollars, we continue to experience earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased earnings from LIFO benefit as steel costs deflated. 
Steel scrap costs began to rise in November of 2019 and have continued inflating through January of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020 and anticipate negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had a $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel scrap and rod and our full year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from foam chemical deflation in our ECS business that I will discuss later in the call. 
Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume and 3% from raw material-related price decreases and a negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was up 2%. 
We are pleased with the performance of our Bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. Spring sales were up 7%, international Spring sales were up 4% and Adjustable Bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our Automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our Aerospace business was up 11% in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased $20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense; lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit; and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%. 
Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate. 
For the full year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to sales. Organic sales were down 3% on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from increases implemented in late 2018 were offset by a negative currency impact. 
Full year organic sales growth in most of our businesses, including U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture and Aerospace, was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and weak trade demand in steel rod and wire. Volume was flat for the year, absent declines from exited business. 
Content gains continued to drive sales growth in both our Bedding and Automotive businesses in 2019. U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher-value innersprings. Our Automotive sales were up 2% for the year, with global auto production down 6%. 
Full year EBIT increased $76 million and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million or 12% to $529 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefits, and improved earnings performance in our Furniture Products segment. Full year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.57. Adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate. 
In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions and gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology, along with scale in the production of private-label finished mattresses. ECS' full year 2019 sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-Bedding markets. Volume was up 11%. As expected, ECS' EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and their cash flow generation is strong. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring and related charges were $15 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete. 
In November, the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to a successful conclusion, with the International Trade Commission making a unanimous final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws. 
Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to him."
30760,641966413,1899136,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2020",2020-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Leggett & Platt, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction in working capital across the company and strong",1028,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction in working capital across the company and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses, including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018. .
In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $279 million. In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. 
Consistent with our deleveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full year, we repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrendered for employee benefit plans at an average price of $44.20. We issued 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises. 
From an acquisition perspective during the year, we acquired ECS and 1 small geo component operations. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $143 million, 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending. 
Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and continue to expect to delever to a ratio of debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisitions and using our operating cash flow to repay debt. 
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the 11% to 14% target in both 2017 as well as 2018 but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those same years, the TSR of the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent 3-year performance did not meet our top 1/3 goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time. 
Now moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance. 2020 sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019 should add 1% to sales growth in 2020. Raw material-related price decreases implemented in the second half of 2019 should at lower sales 1%. 
We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes Automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, Aerospace, Geo Components and Work Furniture. We also expect the growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases from planned exited volume in both Fashion Bed and Home Furniture as well as continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. So absent exited business, volume is expected to be flat to up 4%. 
2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting earnings growth in our Automotive, Bedding and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel cost, including the nonrecurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit. Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because of investments we're making to support the growth, security and continuity of the company. These investments include network and cybersecurity upgrades and personnel to support those activities. We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology. Finally, employee benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan. 
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect 2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million, net interest expense of approximately $80 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2020 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%. Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends should require $220 million of cash. 
Finally, we know impacts from the Corona virus are top of mind for many of you, and we are closely monitoring global developments. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees around the world. 
For our employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdowns in accordance with Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We're establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese facilities to better protect our 5,200 employees in China when they can return to work. 
And for all Leggett & Platt employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are severely restricting all international travel. We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our business, including demand for our goods and our customers' goods, inventory availability throughout our supply chain as well as our customers' supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce availability. 
We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this Corona virus to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- than other global manufacturers. We continue to monitor this situation, and we'll take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The bedding industry feels pretty optimistic in terms of that there's relative stability in that industry, which is kind of a change compared to the last 5 years. And advertising investments seem to be in place, new product launches, so there's excitement around there. We feel pretty good. President's Day is a tough one to call.

Let's talk, first, pricing, and then we'll go through weakness in trade demand, which is very different than our internal demand. But what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed until November, where we saw the first move-up in scrap. So we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December and then $30 a ton in January. 
So we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that as prices deflated in 2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We're flipping that situation in 2020. But because of the kind of the oddities of year-end, we actually are -- decreased our customer prices in January of 2020 because we adjust every quarter. 
So we're -- those contracts, actually, in the face of our increase in input cost, we lower prices because of lag effect. We will be increasing our customers' prices starting in April. So with that, there is a LIFO swing. There is 0 impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck knows, to your point. So that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint. 
From a trade market perspective, again, this is trade, so think of us for about the 25% of the total tons that we produce from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we're like them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad because of the deflation cycle, but the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro, U.S. economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution. 
So people may question, ""Well, wait a second, the steel -- U.S. steel industry was protected by Trump tariffs last year while the products weren't."" So there was a continued inflow of products in an environment where export demand was very, very soft. So from a trade perspective, that's really what happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but steel moves are really, really complex."

So I'll complete that discussion by saying, just to be clear, as we look at quarters throughout 2020, we expect sales in the first half of the year to be down slightly and then in the second half of the year to be up slightly. And so the stuff that he was talking about, and you guys have alluded to, there's more impact from the excess volume in the first half of the year. We've got the flip from deflation to inflation. By the second half of the year, we expect to have anniversaried most of the exit volume. So that's on the sales side. 
On the earnings side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest of the year. And that gets to the steel lag that Karl was talking about, a slip on the steel side. And then for the full year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly versus each quarter in 2019 and then for the full year of 2019."

First, I want to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. In 2019, our employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history; the very successful restructuring of our Home Furniture business, where we are already seeing an EBIT margin benefit; the orderly closure of our Fashion Bed business and successful liquidation of that inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on deleveraging; generating record cash from operations; and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our employees across the company. And these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all. 
As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to our segment structure. 
These changes align with how we manage our businesses. Effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding-related businesses, including our innerspring and Specialty Foam businesses, our Steel Rod and wire and Machinery businesses and our Adjustable Bed business, will be 1 Bedding Products segment. This optimizes efficiency and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of rod, wire, spring specialty foam. 
The newly formed Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment will contain our Home and Work Furniture businesses, our Flooring Products business and our Fabric Converting and Geo Components businesses. Our Specialized Products segment is not changing and includes our Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinder (sic) [ Hydraulic Cylinders ] businesses.
The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020 earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing 5 years of historical segment data based upon the new segment reporting structure. 
We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance: 4 sales grew 11%; EBIT grew 18% and adjusted EBIT grew 12%; full year EPS was $2.47; and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end.
We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material cost, primarily steel scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings, along with corresponding movements in LIFO benefit or expense. We passed our steel cost increases or decreases along to our customers after an approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag, in the first half of 2019, our selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018. At the same time, our cost for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars were increasing and earnings benefited from the lower cost.
In the second half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap cost along to our rod wire and innerspring customers. Despite downward effect of our -- on our sales dollars, we continue to experience earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased earnings from LIFO benefit as steel costs deflated. 
Steel scrap costs began to rise in November 2019 and have continued inflating through January of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020 and anticipate negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had a $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel scrap and rod and our full year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from [ foam ] chemical deflation in our ECS business that I will discuss later in the call.
Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume and 3% from raw material-related price decreases and a negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was up 2%.
We are pleased with the performance of our Bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. Spring sales were up 7%, International Spring sales were up 4% and Adjustable Bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our Automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our Aerospace business was up 11% in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased $20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense; lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit; and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%.
Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.
For the full year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to sales. Organic sales were down 3% on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from increases implemented in late 2018 were offset by a negative currency impact.
Full year organic sales growth in most of our businesses, including U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture and Aerospace, was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and weak trade demand in steel rod and wire. Volume was flat for the year, absent declines from exited business.
Content gains continued to drive sales growth in both our Bedding and Automotive businesses in 2019. U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher-value innersprings. Our Automotive sales were up 2% for the year, with global auto production down 6%.
Full year EBIT increased $76 million and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million or 12% to $529 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit, and improved earnings performance in our Furniture Products segment. Full year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.57. Adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.
In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions and gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology, along with scale in the production of private-label finished mattresses. ECS' full year 2019 sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-Bedding markets. Volume was up 11%. As expected, ECS' EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and their cash flow generation is strong.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring and related charges were $15 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete.
In November, the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to a successful conclusion, with the International Trade Commission making a unanimous final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws.
Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to him."

In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction in working capital across the company and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses, including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018.
In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $279 million. In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.
Consistent with our deleveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full year, we repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrendered for employee benefit plans at an average price of $44.20. We issued 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.
From an acquisition perspective during the year, we acquired ECS and 1 small Geo Component operation. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $143 million, 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending.
Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and continue to expect to delever to a ratio of debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisitions and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the 11% to 14% target in both 2017 as well as 2018 but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those same years, the TSR of the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent 3-year performance did not meet our top 1/3 goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time.
Now moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance. 2020 sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019 should add 1% to sales growth in 2020. Raw material-related price decreases implemented in the second half of 2019 should lower sales 1%.
We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes Automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, Aerospace, Geo Components and Work Furniture. We also expect the growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases from planned exited volume in both Fashion Bed and Home Furniture as well as continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. So absent exited business, volume is expected to be flat to up 4%.
2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting earnings growth in our Automotive, Bedding and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel cost, including the nonrecurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit. Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because of investments we're making to support the growth, security and continuity of the company. These investments include network and cybersecurity upgrades and personnel to support those activities. We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology. Finally, employee benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan.
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect 2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million, net interest expense of approximately $80 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2020 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%. Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends should require $220 million of cash.
Finally, we know impacts from the Coronavirus are top of mind for many of you, and we are closely monitoring global developments. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees around the world.
For our employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdowns in accordance with Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We're establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese facilities to better protect our 5,200 employees in China when they can return to work.
And for all Leggett & Platt employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are severely restricting all international travel. We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our business, including demand for our goods and our customers' goods, inventory availability throughout our supply chain as well as our customers' supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce availability.
We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this Coronavirus to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- than other global manufacturers. We continue to monitor this situation, and we'll take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

The bedding industry feels pretty optimistic in terms of that there's relative stability in that industry, which is kind of a change compared to the last 5 years. And advertising investments seem to be in place, new product launches, so there's excitement around there. We feel pretty good. President's Day is a tough one to call.

Let's talk, first, pricing, and then we'll go through weakness in trade demand, which is very different than our internal demand. But what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed until November, where we saw the first move-up in scrap. So we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December and then $30 a ton in January. 
So we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that as prices deflated in 2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We're flipping that situation in 2020. But because of the kind of the oddities of year-end, we actually are -- decreased our customer prices in January of 2020 because we adjust every quarter. 
So we're -- those contracts, actually, in the face of our increase in input cost, we lower prices because of lag effect. We will be increasing our customers' prices starting in April. So with that, there is a LIFO swing. There is 0 impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck knows, to your point. So that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint. 
From a trade market perspective, again, this is trade, so think of us for about the 25% of the total tons that we produce from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we're like them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad because of the deflation cycle, but the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro, U.S. economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution. 
So people may question, ""Well, wait a second, the steel -- U.S. steel industry was protected by Trump tariffs last year while the products weren't."" So there was a continued inflow of products in an environment where export demand was very, very soft. So from a trade perspective, that's really what happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but steel moves are really, really complex."

So I'll complete that discussion by saying, just to be clear, as we look at quarters throughout 2020, we expect sales in the first half of the year to be down slightly and then in the second half of the year to be up slightly. And so the stuff that he was talking about, and you guys have alluded to, there's more impact from the excess volume in the first half of the year. We've got the flip from deflation to inflation. By the second half of the year, we expect to have anniversaried most of the exit volume. So that's on the sales side. 
On the earnings side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest of the year. And that gets to the steel lag that Karl was talking about, a slip on the steel side. And then for the full year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly versus each quarter in 2019 and then for the full year of 2019."

Of course, the Boeing 737 MAX production halt is big news in the industry. But the supply chain -- dip in the supply chain -- had been struggling to catch up for a long time. And so while they have stopped production, it really hasn't impacted us at this point. 
We're also seeing really strong production on some of the engine platforms that we're on. And remember, we service not only Boeing but the Airbus planes as well. And so that's really what has been driving our strong growth in the last couple of quarters, particularly on our fabrication facilities in the U.S. and in Europe. And we see that continuing into 2020. I think that, right now, our outlook is for low double-digit growth there in Aerospace continuing."

First, I want to thank our dedicated fellow employees around the world for your efforts during this past year. In 2019, our employees accomplished the acquisition and integration of ECS, the largest acquisition in our history; the very successful restructuring of our Home Furniture business, where we are already seeing an EBIT margin benefit; the orderly closure of our Fashion Bed business and successful liquidation of that inventory, all while keeping a sharp focus on deleveraging; generating record cash from operations; and delivering our 48th consecutive annual dividend increase. This represents tremendous work by our employees across the company. And these efforts are very much appreciated. Thank you all. 
As a reminder, in November, we filed an 8-K that discussed changes to our segment structure. 
These changes align with how we manage our businesses. Effective January 1, 2020, all of our bedding-related businesses, including our innerspring and Specialty Foam businesses, our Steel Rod and wire and Machinery businesses and our Adjustable Bed business, will be 1 Bedding Products segment. This optimizes efficiency and allows us to holistically manage our bedding value chain of rod, wire, spring specialty foam. 
The newly formed Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment will contain our Home and Work Furniture businesses, our Flooring Products business and our Fabric Converting and Geo Components businesses. Our Specialized Products segment is not changing and includes our Automotive, Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinder (sic) [ Hydraulic Cylinders ] businesses.
The segment commentary in yesterday's press release is based on the historical reporting format as we continue to report under the prior segment structure through 2019. Before we report first quarter 2020 earnings, we will furnish an 8-K providing 5 years of historical segment data based upon the new segment reporting structure. 
We have several items to highlight in our 2019 performance: 4 sales grew 11%; EBIT grew 18% and adjusted EBIT grew 12%; full year EPS was $2.47; and adjusted EPS was $2.57, a 4% increase over 2018 adjusted EPS. We generated record operating cash flow of $668 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales improved to a low 9.9% at year-end.
We experienced fluctuations in sales and earnings from the effects of raw material cost, primarily steel scrap cost and selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings, along with corresponding movements in LIFO benefit or expense. We passed our steel cost increases or decreases along to our customers after an approximate 90-day lag. Because of this lag, in the first half of 2019, our selling prices for steel rod, wire and innersprings increased from the recovery of cost inflation that occurred in 2018. At the same time, our cost for steel scrap were deflating. This had a positive impact on both sales and earnings as sales dollars were increasing and earnings benefited from the lower cost.
In the second half of 2019, we began to pass our lower steel scrap cost along to our rod wire and innerspring customers. Despite downward effect of our -- on our sales dollars, we continue to experience earnings growth from steel cost deflation through October of 2019. We also experienced increased earnings from LIFO benefit as steel costs deflated. 
Steel scrap costs began to rise in November 2019 and have continued inflating through January of 2020. We expect steel movements to cause sales and earnings fluctuations in 2020 and anticipate negative earnings impact in the first quarter. We also expect year-over-year changes in LIFO as we had a $32 million LIFO benefit in 2019. As the quarters progress, we will update you on the changes in steel scrap and rod and our full year LIFO expectations. While we are most affected by moves in steel scrap and rod, we also experienced a negative effect on sales from [ foam ] chemical deflation in our ECS business that I will discuss later in the call.
Fourth quarter sales increased 9% to $1.14 billion. The ECS acquisition added 13% to sales in the quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, 1% from volume and 3% from raw material-related price decreases and a negative currency impact. Most of our businesses grew in the fourth quarter. The growth was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. Absent declines from exited businesses, volume was up 2%.
We are pleased with the performance of our Bedding businesses in the quarter. U.S. Spring sales were up 7%, International Spring sales were up 4% and Adjustable Bed sales were up 22%. In addition, our Automotive business was up 8% in the quarter, while global auto production was down 5%. Our Aerospace business was up 11% in the quarter. 
Fourth quarter EBIT increased $51 million over fourth quarter 2018, and adjusted EBIT increased $20 million or 17% to $140 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $12 million of amortization expense; lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit; and improved earnings performance in Furniture Products. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points to 12.2%, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 160 basis points to 16.4%.
Fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.64. This included restructuring-related charges that reduced earnings $0.04 per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.68 per share, a 10% increase versus fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in fourth quarter earnings reflects higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.
For the full year 2019, sales grew 11% to $4.75 billion. ECS and other smaller acquisitions added 14% to sales. Organic sales were down 3% on 3% lower volume. Raw material-related selling price inflation from increases implemented in late 2018 were offset by a negative currency impact.
Full year organic sales growth in most of our businesses, including U.S. Spring, Automotive, Work Furniture and Aerospace, was more than offset by the planned exit of business in Fashion Bed and Home Furniture, which reduced sales 3%, and weak trade demand in steel rod and wire. Volume was flat for the year, absent declines from exited business.
Content gains continued to drive sales growth in both our Bedding and Automotive businesses in 2019. U.S. Spring sales were up 6%, benefiting from the continued shift to higher-value innersprings. Our Automotive sales were up 2% for the year, with global auto production down 6%.
Full year EBIT increased $76 million and adjusted EBIT increased $56 million or 12% to $529 million. Adjusted EBIT benefited from the ECS acquisition, even after $50 million of acquisition accounting, lower raw material cost, including LIFO benefit, and improved earnings performance in our Furniture Products segment. Full year earnings per share increased to $2.47, adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.57. Adjusted EPS benefited from higher EBIT, partially offset by higher interest expense and tax rate.
In January 2019, we acquired Elite Comfort Solutions and gained critical capabilities in proprietary foam technology, along with scale in the production of private-label finished mattresses. ECS' full year 2019 sales were flat with 2018, primarily from deflation and weaker demand in non-Bedding markets. Volume was up 11%. As expected, ECS' EBITDA margin is accretive to our total company EBITDA margin, and their cash flow generation is strong.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated restructuring activities after an in-depth analysis of our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. Total restructuring and related charges were $15 million in 2019 and $16 million in 2018. The restructuring activity is substantially complete.
In November, the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on imported Chinese mattresses came to a successful conclusion, with the International Trade Commission making a unanimous final determination that the U.S. industry had been materially injured by Chinese mattresses sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws.
Jeff will discuss our 2019 financial details and full year guidance for 2020. I'll now turn the call over to him."

In 2019, we generated record cash flow from operations of $668 million, a $228 million increase over 2018. This improvement was driven by a significant reduction in working capital across the company and strong operating cash generation in many of our businesses, including ECS. We ended the year with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales of 9.9%, an improvement versus 10.6% at the end of 2018.
In addition, we brought back $96 million of offshore cash in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $279 million. In November, we declared a $0.40 per share quarterly dividend, a 5% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2018. At yesterday's closing price of $46.96, the current yield is 3.4%, which is one of the higher yields among the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.
Consistent with our deleveraging plan, share repurchases were limited in 2019. For the full year, we repurchased only 700,000 shares of our stock, primarily surrendered for employee benefit plans at an average price of $44.20. We issued 2 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans and stock option exercises.
From an acquisition perspective during the year, we acquired ECS and 1 small Geo Component operation. We also continued investing capital to support organic growth opportunities. Total capital expenditures in 2019 were $143 million, 10% lower than the prior year, reflecting a balance of investing for the future while controlling our spending.
Our financial base remains strong. We ended 2019 with debt at 2.9x our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment-grade credit rating and continue to expect to delever to a ratio of debt-to-trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of approximately 2.5x by the end of 2020. We expect to accomplish this by limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisitions and using our operating cash flow to repay debt.
We assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return to that of peer companies on a rolling 3-year basis. Our target is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term, which we believe will require an average TSR of 11% to 14% per year. Our annual TSR was below the 11% to 14% target in both 2017 as well as 2018 but significantly above the target in 2019. Over those same years, the TSR of the S&P 500 was well above historical averages. As a result, our recent 3-year performance did not meet our top 1/3 goal. However, we believe our disciplined growth strategy, portfolio management and prudent use of capital will support achievement of this goal over time.
Now moving to a discussion of our 2020 guidance. 2020 sales are expected to be in the range of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion or down 1% to up 3% over 2019. Acquisitions in 2019 should add 1% to sales growth in 2020. Raw material-related price decreases implemented in the second half of 2019 should lower sales 1%.
We expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2020 for most of our major businesses. This includes Automotive, U.S. Spring, ECS, Aerospace, Geo Components and Work Furniture. We also expect the growth in these businesses to be offset by approximately 1% of further year-over-year sales decreases from planned exited volume in both Fashion Bed and Home Furniture as well as continued weak trade demand for steel rod and wire. So absent exited business, volume is expected to be flat to up 4%.
2020 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60, reflecting earnings growth in our Automotive, Bedding and other businesses to be more than offset by increasing steel cost, including the nonrecurrence of 2019's LIFO benefit. Additionally, we expect increased cost in 2020 because of investments we're making to support the growth, security and continuity of the company. These investments include network and cybersecurity upgrades and personnel to support those activities. We're also investing in our human resources organizations and related technology. Finally, employee benefit costs are increasing due to a valuable change we made to our 401(k) plan, adding employee auto enrollment. We're very pleased that this change increased employee participation rates in the 401(k) plan.
Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year effective tax rate of 23% versus 22% in 2019. We expect 2020 depreciation and amortization to approximate $200 million, net interest expense of approximately $80 million and fully diluted shares of 136 million. Based upon this guidance framework, our 2020 full year adjusted EBIT margin should be in the range of 10.7% to 11%. Cash from operations should approximate $550 million in 2020. Capital expenditures should approximate $160 million for the year and dividends should require $220 million of cash.
Finally, we know impacts from the Coronavirus are top of mind for many of you, and we are closely monitoring global developments. Our current 2020 guidance does not include possible impacts from the virus. It's still too early to develop reasonable quantitative data related to the impact. Our first priority is the health and safety of our employees around the world.
For our employees in China, we've extended the Lunar New Year plant shutdowns in accordance with Chinese provincial and local government extensions. We're establishing protocols in all 16 of our Chinese facilities to better protect our 5,200 employees in China when they can return to work.
And for all Leggett & Platt employees around the world, we've implemented a travel ban to Asia and are severely restricting all international travel. We're assessing the potential impact of this pandemic on our business, including demand for our goods and our customers' goods, inventory availability throughout our supply chain as well as our customers' supply chain, the global movement of goods and workforce availability.
We do not anticipate that there are factors unique to us that will cause the impact from this Coronavirus to be greater to our company than our global manufacturers -- than other global manufacturers. We continue to monitor this situation, and we'll take all reasonable mitigation steps as facts unfold.
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Wendy."

Let's talk, first, pricing, and then we'll go through weakness in trade demand, which is very different than our internal demand. But what happened is a continual deflation of input costs as 2019 progressed until November, where we saw the first move-up in scrap. So we saw steel scrap inflate in November at a rate of $20 a ton, followed by $25 a ton in December and then $30 a ton in January. 
So we're dealing now with kind of the reverse lag effect from the standpoint that as prices deflated in 2019. We kept that benefit for 90 days. We're flipping that situation in 2020. But because of the kind of the oddities of year-end, we actually are -- decreased our customer prices in January of 2020 because we adjust every quarter. 
So we're -- those contracts, actually, in the face of our increase in input cost, we lower prices because of lag effect. We will be increasing our customers' prices starting in April. So with that, there is a LIFO swing. There is 0 impact of LIFO expense in our forecast for 2020 as we laid out guidance, but who the heck knows, to your point. So that's what's happening from a pricing standpoint. 
From a trade market perspective, again, this is trade, so think of us for about the 25% of the total tons that we produce from the perspective as you would a large public steel company. In that case, we're like them from the standpoint that our metal margins are okay. Margins aren't so bad because of the deflation cycle, but the demand is incredibly soft. It's not specific to any particular sector. It's just macro, U.S. economic and export demand for steel products in virtually every channel of distribution. 
So people may question, ""Well, wait a second, the steel -- U.S. steel industry was protected by Trump tariffs last year while the products weren't."" So there was a continued inflow of products in an environment where export demand was very, very soft. So from a trade perspective, that's really what happened in 2019, and we don't see a change in that in 2020. So I apologize for the long-winded answer, but steel moves are really, really complex."

So I'll complete that discussion by saying, just to be clear, as we look at quarters throughout 2020, we expect sales in the first half of the year to be down slightly and then in the second half of the year to be up slightly. And so the stuff that he was talking about, and you guys have alluded to, there's more impact from the excess volume in the first half of the year. We've got the flip from deflation to inflation. By the second half of the year, we expect to have anniversaried most of the exit volume. So that's on the sales side. 
On the earnings side, we would expect to see our quarterly margins, the margin trend to be very similar to what we experienced in 2019, including the first quarter being lower than our expectations for the rest of the year. And that gets to the steel lag that Karl was talking about, a slip on the steel side. And then for the full year, we would pattern the margin progression basically to be flat to down slightly versus each quarter in 2019 and then for the full year of 2019."

We continued to see gains in the fourth week of the quarter in our bedding operations but do not yet have full visibility across all of our businesses. We quickly implemented cost savings measures across the company, aligning our variable cost structure to current demand levels. About 3/4 of our operations have remained open to service customers but with very limited production and staffing. As demand improves and production ramps back up, we will begin to return our employees to work on a measured basis. We also move quickly to reduce our fixed cost, which historically have been approximately 25% of our total costs. We eliminated nonessential spending across the company. We postponed the investments we spoke about on the last earnings call, including network upgrades and enhancing our human resources organization and related technology. We implemented a 50% salary reduction for our senior executive officers and a 50% cut in the cash portion of our Board retainers. We expect these actions to reduce our fixed costs this year by approximately $130 million to $150 million with a benefit in the second quarter of nearly $50 million. We deeply regret the impact of these measures on our employees affected by temporary layoffs, and we look forward to bringing them back to work as soon as we can. We also are closely monitoring all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. We also have taken steps to tightly control inventory. We dramatically reduced purchases and production levels, and in most cases, we have been fulfilling customer orders out of inventory. As demand has improved, we are in the process of increasing production in some of our businesses. Our Bedding products segment initially suffered the most rapid and steep decline in demand. Through mid-March, weekly average sales were approximately $45 million. In the final 2 weeks of the quarter, sales decreased by over 40% and 60% versus the weekly average. By the third week of the second quarter, sales were over 50% of the weekly average. Demand continued to improve last week. I anticipate that sales were roughly 65% to 70% of the average last week. The U.S. bedding industry has been severely impacted by widespread closures of traditional retailers as government shutdown orders went into place. E-commerce channels have fared somewhat better. In our Specialized Products segment, weekly sales averaged $20 million through mid-March. In the final 2 weeks of the first quarter, sales decreased roughly 50% as the pandemic spread across Europe and North America. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down to over 60% as automotive OEM plants remain idle. Our Asian automotive business was the first to experience declines as the Chinese government ordered shutdowns in late January. We restored most of our China production by the end of February but then faced a global decline in demand across all regions. Currently, all of our European and North American automotive operations are idle, and our Asian facilities are operating at a reduced rate. In response, we significantly reduced fixed cost and variable costs across the business. In the European and North American automotive markets, we see several OEMs planning to restart production in mid-May. Regardless of when production resumes, we expect the supply chain restart to be complex and take time to ramp up. In the Furniture, Flooring and Textile products segment, average weekly sales were slightly over $25 million throughout the first quarter. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down approximately 30% versus the weekly average. Looking forward, our strategic priorities for the second quarter are optimizing cash flow understanding changes in demand and corresponding opportunities and planning for expanded production across our operations as markets reopen and demand improves. In early March, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team that meets daily. We help our business leaders manage items such as responding to workplace health and safety issues, establishing protocols, interpreting government orders and securing personal protective equipment. Team developed a comprehensive handbook to document new work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate proper social distancing. Our business leaders are actively implementing training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. I am incredibly proud of our business leaders and the crisis response team. They have done a terrific job. They are collaborating, adapting and rising to the challenge. Their efforts will help all of our employees feel safe and be safe both today and as we ramp up production. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

The dec",572,"Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to address the dividend. In keeping with their regular practice, our Board of Directors expect to make a decision on our second quarter dividend during the Board meeting later this month. The decision will take the evolving economic conditions into consideration. Next, as Mitch discussed in his comments, our primary financial focus since mid-March has been on generating cash, disciplined uses of cash and retaining liquidity in response to COVID-19 impacts. Commercial paper is our primary source of short term liquidity. Our commercial paper program is backed by $1.2 billion, unsecured, revolving credit facility with a syndicate of leading banks. The credit facility's financial covenant is a debt-to-trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. Prior to March 31, the covenant required debt to remain below 4.25x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of March 31, the covenant stepped down to 3.5x. This was a planned onetime step down when we increased the size of the credit facility in connection with our January 2019 acquisition of ECS. The step down effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility. The maximum that we can draw is now 3.5x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. At March 31, our debt-to-trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility, equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $650 million. On March 31, we our total liquidity was $734 million, comprised of $506 million in cash on hand and $228 million in available capacity under the commercial paper program. This past Friday, May 1, we had $372 million in remaining capacity under the revolver with $278 million in commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 days and a weighted average interest rate of 2.53%. Because we do not know how long a significant demand decreases across our markets will continue, we are currently working with our bank group to amend covenants in our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have taken several steps to reduce our uses of cash for the remainder of the year. As Mitch discussed, we cut nonessential spending and reduced fixed costs by an estimated range of $130 million to $150 million, the large majority of which will benefit cash. We reduced our capital expenditure budget by over 60% to approximately $60 million for the year. We are halting acquisitions and our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year totaled $37.5 million. Importantly, we have no significant debt maturities until August 2022. We also expect a 2020 cash flow benefit of approximately $15 million from the payroll tax deferral provision of the Cares Act based on our latest estimates. This provision allows payment deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes for the remainder of 2020. These employer taxes will be paid over the following 2 years: Half in 2021 and in the other half in 2022. Concerning our credit exposure and risk, we increased our accounts receivable reserve in the first quarter. We recognized $12 million in bad debt expense primarily from COVID-19 impact on our customers and risk across our account portfolio, particularly among our bedding customers. If this situation persists, our credit exposure could continue to deteriorate. In summary, we remain committed to our balance sheet and are being proactive to maximize our liquidity as well as our flexibility through this uniquely uncertain time. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Karl for closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our employees and how they have pulled together to support each other and their communities. Our employees are providing components for hospital beds and medical mattresses, helping solve supply chain issues and ventilator production.

Finally, our specialty Foam chemicals team has found a way to produce hand sanitizer to provide to our own facilities. To our employees, thank you for your dedication and resilience in these uncertain times. As Mitch and Jeff explained, like so many of you and communities around the world, we are facing significant business challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unprecedented circumstances have forced us to make very difficult decisions as we take steps to reduce costs during this period of drastic decreases in demand. The decisions to temporarily lay off a large number of our employees around the world was one of the most difficult of my career as our strength has always been and will continue to be our people. Please note, we are focused on doing everything we can to return our employees to work. Leggett has successfully navigated several challenging business and economic conditions in its story, 137 year history. Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets. Focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company and are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy."

But as Mitch mentioned in his comments, it's a very complicated supply chain, and it's going to take some time to work through here in the short term. So North America and Europe stock very quickly and that left not much opportunity to build ahead any kind of inventory or critical components. So restarting the supply chain, which is starting this week, to some extent, will take pretty significant effort. There will be intermittent stoppages due to the interdependence of the supply chain; countries, states, all of the different restrictions that are out there right now, hamper that from operating as effectively as it could. We believe we'll see it starting out with single ships, shorter ships, probably slower line rates and shifting content towards stuffed vehicles that are easier to build. We know our customers are going to have to proceed very carefully like us. They're going to have to monitor their employees, have PPE there for them, implement new processes. So we think it's going to start off slow. As these are kind of trial runs of the social distancing. A little further out, it will probably push model changeovers out a bit. So typically, there is a model change coming up here. EPA can't certify. Vehicles costumers haven't been able to do the engineering and certification validation. So we can see those kinds of things push out 2 to 3 months. Longer term, we see that some of the macros of the industry of connected, autonomous and shared are definitely going to be impacted. In the short term, particularly around autonomous and shared vehicles. The return on autonomous is out too far in shared just because of the COVID element of it. So we'll see many of those developments get pushed out a little further. Our belief is the areas that we play in and comfort and convenience will matter more in the future regardless of where the market is headed, and we'll continue to be a pretty relevant supplier in the future. And this can take probably a few years to work its way through. So that's it for Automotive. In Aerospace, we held up pretty well in the first quarter. We were less impacted at the end of the first quarter when we start to feel that a little bit going into Q2. Extreme disruptions to air travel. We expect that long-term aircraft production will be reduced because of passenger demand and also the airlines financial condition. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced production cuts as a result, but we don't really know what that means at this time. But we are expecting that, again, this will take some time to work its way out."

But what we're hearing is the small independence, Bobby, are actually faring reasonably well. They tend to be in smaller communities that are less impacted and the sales through those channels have actually been stronger than average. So rural brick-and-mortar is doing fine. The larger, more heavily leveraged chains that had been impacted by private equity over the last few years are not faring as well because they're more highly levered. But long term, I think that there'll be a continued mix to e-commerce. We're certainly seeing that in e-commerce distribution being stronger than brick-and-mortar. But to your point and to your -- our shared concern as long-term post recovery, the goodness, the ability for product to be distributed through a supply chain ultimately to Mis's consumer in a way that is -- fits her preferences and their desires to experience in the product and/or buy from -- in an omnichannel environment is important. But we haven't really seen a lot of negative impact. The fact that stores are starting to come back to live life, we've seen some early -- just in the last few days, a little bit of recovery in home furniture. The governor of California's announcement last night that he was going to start to open some retail distribution. It certainly is positive. It depends on how that's all phased. But -- I rambled a whole lot, but Mitch is always more substantive than I am. But Mitch, do you have anything to add?"

That -- the question's better than the answer, that what we saw or what the industry saw is from a purely from a steel perspective, scrap traded down pretty significantly in April. It looks like it's going to trade up in May because of the lack of availability of scrap. There's not a lot of scrap being collected at these low prices, and it's not being produced because of really no North American automotive production. And to Steve's point, that will start slowly. So it -- I would expect it's -- steel is always a supply and demand issue, and there's not a whole lot of demand. I would expect that steel cost will continue to stay somewhat muted but if demand picks up before supply, remembering there's a lot of productive capacity that's idled right now, we may see a couple months of blip where costs do accelerate. On the input cost for Foam Chemicals, we're seeing deflation. But to be real honest with you, in that whole sector, there's not a whole lot of demand. So -- not everybody is able to make use of these lower input costs. So it's a great question. I'm not sure that we're confident that we're going to have the benefit from input cost deflation going into the back end of the year as people might think, purely because of supply and demand dynamics."

We didn't have -- as a macro economy, we didn't have 30 million people file for unemployment in a 3-week period. So much of the demand that we experience is based on consumer confidence, and we have a consumer that doesn't know, frankly, what to think. So they're just completely different dynamics. What we don't know today is depth or duration. The company's ability to generate cash is significant. Jeff's answer was spot on in that cash generation in 2Q should be really pretty good, but it all depends on demand in Q3 and Q4 from a sales perspective and to be able to get that operating income married by cash generation, which is what we really experienced in 2008 and '09. So it's distinctly different. I will tell you that the portfolio is much healthier today than it was in that time frame. Big cash generation -- generators in the bedding supply chain in automotive once it restarts. So we're in a better spot in admittedly more difficult environment that's much more difficult to predict and is very uncertain with volatility. That's -- it's maybe embarrassing for us not to be able to guide, but heck, we don't know if there's going to be a second wave. We just don't know.

The impact to our operations from COVID-19 developed in China by January and across all geographies by mid-March. Throughout most of the first quarter, weekly sales averaged approximately $90 million, consistent with 2019. However, in the final 2 weeks of the quarter, we saw a steep and rapid sales decline across the company, with sales down roughly 40% and 50% versus the weekly average. Sales reached a low point in the first week of the second quarter, down 60% versus the weekly average and have been recovering since then. Sales in the third week of the quarter were down approximately 45% versus the weekly average. We continued to see gains in the fourth week of the quarter in our Bedding operations but do not yet have full visibility across all of our businesses. We quickly implemented cost savings measures across the company, aligning our variable cost structure to current demand levels. About 3/4 of our operations have remained open to service customers but with very limited production and staffing. As demand improves and production ramps back up, we will begin to return our employees to work on a measured basis. We also moved quickly to reduce our fixed cost, which historically have been approximately 25% of our total costs. We eliminated nonessential spending across the company. We postponed the investments we spoke about on the last earnings call, including network upgrades and enhancing our human resources organization and related technology. We implemented a 50% salary reduction for our senior executive officers and a 50% cut in the cash portion of our Board retainers. We expect these actions to reduce our fixed costs this year by approximately $130 million to $150 million with a benefit in the second quarter of nearly $50 million. We deeply regret the impact of these measures on our employees affected by temporary layoffs, and we look forward to bringing them back to work as soon as we can. 
We also are closely monitoring all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. We also have taken steps to tightly control inventory. We dramatically reduced purchases and production levels, and in most cases, we have been fulfilling customer orders out of inventory. As demand has improved, we are in the process of increasing production in some of our businesses. Our Bedding products segment initially suffered the most rapid and steep decline in demand. Through mid-March, weekly average sales were approximately $45 million. In the final 2 weeks of the quarter, sales decreased by over 40% and 60% versus the weekly average. By the third week of the second quarter, sales were over 50% of the weekly average. Demand continued to improve last week. I anticipate that sales were roughly 65% to 70% of the average last week. The U.S. Bedding Industry has been severely impacted by widespread closures of traditional retailers as government shutdown orders went into place. E-commerce channels have fared somewhat better. 
In our Specialized Products segment, weekly sales averaged $20 million through mid-March. In the final 2 weeks of the first quarter, sales decreased roughly 50% as the pandemic spread across Europe and North America. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down to over 60% as automotive OEM plants remain idle. Our Asian Automotive business was the first to experience declines as the Chinese government ordered shutdowns in late January. We restored most of our China production by the end of February but then faced a global decline in demand across all regions. Currently, all of our European and North American Automotive operations are idle, and our Asian facilities are operating at a reduced rate. In response, we significantly reduced fixed cost and variable costs across the business. In the European and North American automotive markets, we see several OEMs planning to restart production in mid-May. Regardless of when production resumes, we expect the supply chain restart to be complex and take time to ramp up. 
In the Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment, average weekly sales were slightly over $25 million throughout the first quarter. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down approximately 30% versus the weekly average. 
Looking forward, our strategic priorities for the second quarter are optimizing cash flow, understanding changes in demand and corresponding opportunities and planning for expanded production across our operations as markets reopen and demand improves. 
In early March, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team that meets daily. We help our business leaders manage items such as responding to workplace health and safety issues, establishing protocols, interpreting government orders and securing personal protective equipment. The team developed a comprehensive handbook to document new work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate proper social distancing. Our business leaders are actively implementing training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. I am incredibly proud of our business leaders and the crisis response team. They have done a terrific job. They are collaborating, adapting and rising to the challenge. Their efforts will help all of our employees feel safe and be safe both today and as we ramp up production. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

The de",575,"Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to address the dividend. And keeping with their regular practice, our Board of Directors expect to make a decision on our second quarter dividend during the Board meeting later this month. The decision will take the evolving economic conditions into consideration. Next, as Mitch discussed in his comments, our primary financial focus since mid-March has been on generating cash, disciplined uses of cash and retaining liquidity in response to COVID-19 impacts. 
Commercial paper is our primary source of short term liquidity. Our commercial paper program is backed by $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of leading banks. The credit facility's financial covenant is a debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. Prior to March 31, the covenant required debt to remain below 4.25x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of March 31, the covenant stepped down to 3.5x. This was a planned onetime step down when we increased the size of the credit facility in connection with our January 2019 acquisition of ECS. The step down effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility. The maximum that we can draw is now 3.5x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. At March 31, our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility, equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $650 million. On March 31, we our total liquidity was $734 million, comprised of $506 million in cash on hand and $228 million in available capacity under the commercial paper program. This past Friday, May 1, we had $372 million in remaining capacity under the revolver, with $278 million in commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 days and a weighted average interest rate of 2.53%. Because we do not know how long the significant demand decreases across our markets will continue, we are currently working with our bank group to amend covenants in our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have taken several steps to reduce our uses of cash for the remainder of the year. As Mitch discussed, we cut nonessential spending and reduced fixed costs by an estimated range of $130 million to $150 million, the large majority of which will benefit cash. We reduced our capital expenditure budget by over 60% to approximately $60 million for the year. We are halting acquisitions and our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year totaled $37.5 million. Importantly, we have no significant debt maturities until August 2022. We also expect a 2020 cash flow benefit of approximately $15 million from the payroll tax deferral provision of the Cares Act based on our latest estimates. This provision allows payment deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes for the remainder of 2020. These employer taxes will be paid over the following 2 years: half in 2021 and the other half in 2022. 
Concerning our credit exposure and risk, we increased our accounts receivable reserve in the first quarter. We recognized $12 million in bad debt expense primarily from COVID-19 impact on our customers and risk across our account portfolio, particularly among our bedding customers. If this situation persists, our credit exposure could continue to deteriorate. In summary, we remain committed to our balance sheet and are being proactive to maximize our liquidity as well as our flexibility through this uniquely uncertain time. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Karl for closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our employees and how they have pulled together to support each other and their communities. Our employees are providing components for hospital beds and medical mattresses, helping solve supply chain issues and ventilator production, providing wire and fabric for face mass producers, and in some cases, converting our internal resources to face mask production. 
Finally, our Specialty Foam chemicals team has found a way to produce hand sanitizer to provide to our own facilities. 
To our employees, thank you for your dedication and resilience in these uncertain times. As Mitch and Jeff explained, and like so many of you in communities around the world, we are facing significant business challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unprecedented circumstances have forced us to make very difficult decisions as we take steps to reduce costs during this period of drastic decreases in demand. The decisions to temporarily lay off a large number of our employees around the world was one of the most difficult of my career as our strength has always been and will continue to be our people. Please note, we are focused on doing everything we can to return our employees to work. Leggett has successfully navigated several challenging business and economic conditions in its storied 137 year history. Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company and are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy."

But as Mitch mentioned in his comments, it's a very complicated supply chain, and it's going to take some time to work through here in the short term. So North America and Europe stocked very quickly and that left not much opportunity to build ahead any kind of inventory or critical components. So restarting the supply chain, which is starting this week, to some extent, will take pretty significant effort. There will be intermittent stoppages due to the interdependence of the supply chain, countries/states, all of the different restrictions that are out there right now, hamper that from operating as effectively as it could. We believe we'll see it starting out with single ships, shorter ships, probably slower line rates and shifting content towards stuffed vehicles that are easier to build. We know our customers are going to have to proceed very carefully like us. They're going to have to monitor their employees, have PPE there for them, implement new processes. So we think it's going to start off slow, as these are kind of trial runs of the social distancing. A little further out, it will probably push model changeovers out a bit. So typically, there is a model change coming up here. EPA can't certify. Vehicles, costumers haven't been able to do the engineering, certification, validation. So we can see those kinds of things push out 2 to 3 months. Longer term, we see that some of the macros of the industry of connected, autonomous and shared, are definitely going to be impacted in the short term, particularly around autonomous and shared vehicles. The return on autonomous is out too far and shared just because of the COVID element of it. So we'll see many of those developments get pushed out a little further. Our belief is the areas that we play in and comfort and convenience will matter more in the future regardless of where the market's headed, and we'll continue to be a pretty relevant supplier in the future. And this can take probably a few years to work its way through. So that's it for Automotive. 
In Aerospace, we held up pretty well in the first quarter. We were less impacted at the end of the first quarter, but we started to feel that a little bit going into Q2. Extreme disruptions to air travel, we expect that long-term aircraft production will be reduced because of passenger demand and also the airlines financial condition. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced production cuts as a result, but we don't really know what that means at this time. But we are expecting that, again, this will take some time to work its way out."

But what we're hearing is the small independence, Bobby, are actually faring reasonably well. They tend to be in smaller communities that are less impacted and the sales through those channels have actually been stronger than average. So rural brick-and-mortar is doing fine. The larger, more heavily leveraged chains that had been impacted by private equity over the last few years are not faring as well because they're more highly levered. But long term, I think that there'll be a continued mix to e-commerce. We're certainly seeing that in e-commerce distribution being stronger than brick-and-mortar. But to your point and to your -- our shared concern is long-term post recovery, the goodness, the ability for product to be distributed through a supply chain ultimately to Mrs. Consumer in a way that is -- fits her preferences and their desires to experience in the product and/or buy from -- in an omnichannel environment is important. But we haven't really seen a lot of negative impact. The fact that stores are starting to come back to live -- life, we've seen some early -- just in the last few days, a little bit of recovery in Home Furniture. The governor of California's announcement last night that he was going to start to open some retail distribution, certainly is positive. It depends on how that's all phased. But -- I rambled a whole lot, but Mitch is always more substantive than I am. But Mitch, do you have anything to add?"

That -- the question's better than the answer, that what we saw or what the industry saw is from a -- purely from a steel perspective, scrap traded down pretty significantly in April. It looks like it's going to trade up in May because of the lack of availability of scrap. There's not a lot of scrap being collected at these low prices, and it's not being produced because of really no North American automotive production. And to Steve's point, that will start slowly. So it -- I would expect it's -- steel is always a supply and demand issue, and there's not a whole lot of demand. I would expect that steel cost will continue to stay somewhat muted but if demand picks up before supply, remembering there's a lot of productive capacity that's idled right now, we may see a couple of months of blip where costs do accelerate. On the input cost for Foam Chemicals, we're seeing deflation. But to be real honest with you, in that whole sector, there's not a whole lot of demand. So -- not everybody is able to make use of these lower input costs. So it's a great question. I'm not sure that we're confident that we're going to have the benefit from input cost deflation going into the back end of the year as people might think purely because of supply and demand dynamics."

We didn't have -- as a macro economy, we didn't have 30 million people file for unemployment in a 3-week period. So much of the demand that we experience is based on consumer confidence, and we have a consumer that doesn't know, frankly, what to think. So they're just completely different dynamics. What we don't know today is depth or duration. The company's ability to generate cash is significant. Jeff's answer was spot on in that cash generation in 2Q should be really pretty good, but it all depends on demand in Q3 and 4 from a sales perspective and to be able to get that operating income married by cash generation, which is what we really experienced in 2008 and '09. So it's distinctly different. I will tell you that the portfolio is much healthier today than it was in that time frame. Big cash generation -- generators in the bedding supply chain in Automotive once it restarts. So we're in a better spot in a admittedly more difficult environment that's much more difficult to predict and is very uncertain with volatility. That's the -- it's maybe embarrassing for us not to be able to guide, but heck, we don't know if there's going to be a second wave. We just don't know.

The impact to our operations from COVID-19 developed in China by January and across all geographies by mid-March. Throughout most of the first quarter, weekly sales averaged approximately $90 million, consistent with 2019. However, in the final 2 weeks of the quarter, we saw a steep and rapid sales decline across the company, with sales down roughly 40% and 50% versus the weekly average. Sales reached a low point in the first week of the second quarter, down 60% versus the weekly average, and have been recovering since then. Sales in the third week of the quarter were down approximately 45% versus the weekly average. We continued to see gains in the fourth week of the quarter in our Bedding operations but do not yet have full visibility across all of our businesses. We quickly implemented cost savings measures across the company, aligning our variable cost structure to current demand levels. About 3/4 of our operations have remained open to service customers but with very limited production and staffing. As demand improves and production ramps back up, we will begin to return our employees to work on a measured basis. We also moved quickly to reduce our fixed costs, which historically have been approximately 25% of our total costs. We eliminated nonessential spending across the company. We postponed the investments we spoke about on the last earnings call, including network upgrades and enhancing our human resources organization and related technology. We implemented a 50% salary reduction for our senior executive officers and a 50% cut in the cash portion of our Board retainers. We expect these actions to reduce our fixed costs this year by approximately $130 million to $150 million, with a benefit in the second quarter of nearly $50 million. We deeply regret the impact of these measures on our employees affected by temporary layoffs, and we look forward to bringing them back to work as soon as we can. 
We also are closely monitoring all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. We also have taken steps to tightly control inventory. We dramatically reduced purchases and production levels, and in most cases, we have been fulfilling customer orders out of inventory. As demand has improved, we are in the process of increasing production in some of our businesses. Our Bedding products segment initially suffered the most rapid and steep decline in demand. Through mid-March, weekly average sales were approximately $45 million. In the final 2 weeks of the quarter, sales decreased by over 40% and 60% versus the weekly average. By the third week of the second quarter, sales were over 50% of the weekly average. Demand continued to improve last week. I anticipate that sales were roughly 65% to 70% of the average last week. The U.S. bedding industry has been severely impacted by widespread closures of traditional retailers as government shutdown orders went into place. E-commerce channels have fared somewhat better. 
In our Specialized Products segment, weekly sales averaged $20 million through mid-March. In the final 2 weeks of the first quarter, sales decreased roughly 50% as the pandemic spread across Europe and North America. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down over 60% as automotive OEM plants remain idle. Our Asian Automotive business was the first to experience declines as the Chinese government ordered shutdowns in late January. We restored most of our China production by the end of February but then faced a global decline in demand across all regions. Currently, all of our European and North American Automotive operations are idle, and our Asian facilities are operating at a reduced rate. In response, we significantly reduced fixed cost and variable costs across the business. In the European and North American automotive markets, we see several OEMs planning to restart production in mid-May. Regardless of when production resumes, we expect the supply chain restart to be complex and take time to ramp up. 
In the Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment, average weekly sales were slightly over $25 million throughout the first quarter. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down approximately 30% versus the weekly average. 
Looking forward, our strategic priorities for the second quarter are optimizing cash flow, understanding changes in demand and corresponding opportunities, and planning for expanded production across our operations as markets reopen and demand improves. 
In early March, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team that meets daily. We help our business leaders manage items such as responding to workplace health and safety issues, establishing protocols, interpreting government orders and securing personal protective equipment. The team developed a comprehensive handbook to document new work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate proper social distancing. Our business leaders are actively implementing training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. I am incredibly proud of our business leaders and the crisis response team. They have done a terrific job. They are collaborating, adapting and rising to the challenge. Their efforts will help all of our employees feel safe and be safe both today and as we ramp up production. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Commercial paper is our primary source of short-term liquidity. Our commercial paper program is backed by a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of leading banks. The credit facility's financial covenant is a debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. Prior to March 31, the covenant required debt to remain below 4.25x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of March 31, the covenant stepped down to 3.5x. This was a planned onetime stepdown when we increased the size of the credit facility in connection with our January 2019 acquisition of ECS. The stepdown effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility. The maximum that we can draw is now 3.5x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. At March 31, our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility, equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $650 million. On March 31, our total liquidity was $734 million, comprised of $506 million in cash on hand and $228 million in available capacity under the commercial paper program. This past Friday, May 1, we had $372 million in remaining capacity under the revolver, with $278 million in commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 days and a weighted average interest rate of 2.53%. Because we do not know how long the significant demand decreases across our markets will continue, we are currently working with our bank group to amend covenants in our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have taken several steps to reduce our uses of cash for the remainder of the year. As Mitch discussed, we cut nonessential spending and reduced fixed costs by an estimated range of $130 million to $150 million, the large majority of which will benefit cash. We reduced our capital expenditure budget by over 60% to approximately $60 million for the year. We are halting acquisitions and our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year totaled $37.5 million. Importantly, we have no significant debt maturities until August 2022. We also expect a 2020 cash flow benefit of approximately $15 million from the payroll tax deferral provision of the Cares Act based on our latest estimates. This provision allows payment deferral of the employer portion of Social Security taxes for the remainder of 2020. These employer taxes will be paid over the following 2 years: half in 2021 and the other half in 2022. 
Concerning our credit exposure and risk, we increased our accounts receivable reserve in the first quarter. We recognized $12 million in bad debt expense, primarily from COVID-19 impacts on our customers and risk across our account portfolio, particularly among our bedding customers. If this situation persists, our credit exposure could continue to deteriorate. In summary, we remain committed to our balance sheet and are being proactive to maximize our liquidity as well as our flexibility through this uniquely uncertain time. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Karl for closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our employees and how they have pulled together to support each other and their communities. Our employees are providing components for hospital beds and medical mattresses, helping solve supply chain issues and ventilator production, providing wire and fabric for face mask producers, and in some cases, converting our internal resources to face mask production. 
Finally, our Specialty Foam chemicals team has found a way to produce hand sanitizer to provide to our own facilities. 
To our employees, thank you for your dedication and resilience in these uncertain times. As Mitch and Jeff explained, and like so many of you in communities around the world, we are facing significant business challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unprecedented circumstances have forced us to make very difficult decisions as we take steps to reduce costs during this period of drastic decreases in demand. The decisions to temporarily lay off a large number of our employees around the world was one of the most difficult of my career, as our strength has always been and will continue to be our people. Please know we are focused on doing everything we can to return our employees to work. Leggett has successfully navigated several challenging business and economic conditions in its storied 137-year history. Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company and are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy."

But as Mitch mentioned in his comments, it's a very complicated supply chain, and it's going to take some time to work through here in the short term. So North America and Europe stopped very quickly and that left not much opportunity to build ahead any kind of inventory or critical components. So restarting the supply chain, which is starting this week, to some extent, will take pretty significant effort. There will be intermittent stoppages due to the interdependence of the supply chain, countries, states, all of the different restrictions that are out there right now hamper that from operating as effectively as it could. We believe we'll see it starting out with single shifts, shorter shifts, probably slower line rates and shifting content towards stuffed vehicles that are easier to build. We know our customers are going to have to proceed very carefully like us. They're going to have to monitor their employees, have PPE there for them, implement new processes. So we think it's going to start off slow, as these are kind of trial runs of the social distancing. A little further out, it will probably push model changeovers out a bit. So typically, there is a model change coming up here. EPA can't certify vehicles, costumers haven't been able to do the engineering and certification validations. So we can see those kinds of things push out 2 to 3 months. Longer term, we see that some of the macros of the industry of connected, autonomous and shared, are definitely going to be impacted in the short term, particularly around autonomous and shared vehicles. The return on autonomous is out too far, and shared just because of the COVID element of it. So we'll see many of those developments get pushed out a little further. Our belief is, though, the areas that we play in, in comfort and convenience, will matter more in the future regardless of where the market's headed, and we'll continue to be a pretty relevant supplier in the future. And this can take probably a few years to work its way through. So that's it for Automotive. 
In Aerospace, we held up pretty well in the first quarter. We were less impacted at the end of the first quarter, but we started to feel that a little bit going into Q2. Extreme disruptions to air travel, we expect that long-term aircraft production will be reduced because of passenger demand and also the airlines' financial condition. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced production cuts as a result, but we don't really know what that means at this time. But we are expecting that, again, this will take some time to work its way out."

But what we're hearing is the small independents, Bobby, are actually faring reasonably well. They tend to be in smaller communities that are less impacted and the sales through those channels have actually been stronger than average. So rural brick-and-mortar is doing fine. The larger, more heavily leveraged chains that had been impacted by private equity over the last few years are not faring as well because they're more highly levered. But long term, I think that there'll be a continued mix to e-commerce. We're certainly seeing that in e-commerce distribution being stronger than brick-and-mortar. But to your point and to your -- our shared concern is long-term post recovery, the goodness, the ability for product to be distributed through a supply chain ultimately to Mrs. Consumer in a way that is -- fits her preferences and her desires to experiencing the product and/or buy from -- in an omnichannel environment is important. But we haven't really seen a lot of negative impact. The fact that stores are starting to come back to live -- life, we've seen some early -- just in the last few days, a little bit of recovery in Home Furniture. The governor of California's announcement last night that he was going to start to open some retail distribution, certainly is positive. It depends on how that's all phased. But -- I rambled a whole lot, but Mitch is always more substantive than I am. But Mitch, do you have anything to add?"

That -- the question's better than the answer, that what we saw or what the industry saw is from a -- purely from a steel perspective -- scrap trade down pretty significantly in April. It looks like it's going to trade up in May because of the lack of availability of scrap. There's not a lot of scrap being collected at these low prices, and it's not being produced because of really no North American automotive production. And to Steve's point, that will start slowly. So it -- I would expect it's -- steel is always a supply and demand issue, and there's not a whole lot of demand. I would expect that steel cost will continue to stay somewhat muted but if demand picks up before supply, remembering there's a lot of productive capacity that's idled right now, we may see a couple of months of blip where costs do accelerate. On the input cost for Foam Chemicals, we're seeing deflation. But to be real honest with you, in that whole sector, there's not a whole lot of demand. So -- not everybody is able to make use of these lower input costs. So it's a great question. I'm not sure that we're confident that we're going to have the benefit from input cost deflation going into the back end of the year as people might think, purely because of supply and demand dynamics."

We didn't have -- as a macro economy, we didn't have 30 million people file for unemployment in a 3-week period. So much of the demand that we experience is based on consumer confidence, and we have a consumer that doesn't know, frankly, what to think. So they're just completely different dynamics. What we don't know today is depth or duration. The company's ability to generate cash is significant. Jeff's answer was spot on, in that cash generation in 2Q should be really pretty good, but it all depends on demand in Q3 and 4 from a sales perspective and to be able to get that operating income married by cash generation, which is what we really experienced in 2008 and '09. So it's distinctly different. I will tell you that the portfolio is much healthier today than it was in that time frame. Big cash generation -- generators in the bedding supply chain in Automotive once it restarts. So we're in a better spot in a admittedly more difficult environment that's much more difficult to predict and is very uncertain with volatility. That's the -- it's maybe embarrassing for us not to be able to guide, but heck, we don't know if there's going to be a second wave. We just don't know. We're appreciative of the trends that we're experiencing in April. But I mean, heck, that doesn't mean that they'll continue. It always feels like we're 1 day away from bad news."

Typically, Bobby, as you know, this would be the season when normal Bedding and Furniture starts to pick up some acceleration moving into Memorial Day. But there's nothing normal about this year. So, a great question we don't know the answer to."

The impact to our operations from COVID-19 developed in China by January and across all geographies by mid-March. Throughout most of the first quarter, weekly sales averaged approximately $90 million, consistent with 2019. However, in the final 2 weeks of the quarter, we saw a steep and rapid sales decline across the company, with sales down roughly 40% and 50% versus the weekly average. Sales reached a low point in the first week of the second quarter, down 60% versus the weekly average, and have been recovering since then. Sales in the third week of the quarter were down approximately 45% versus the weekly average. We continued to see gains in the fourth week of the quarter in our Bedding operations but do not yet have full visibility across all of our businesses. We quickly implemented cost savings measures across the company, aligning our variable cost structure to current demand levels. About 3/4 of our operations have remained open to service customers but with very limited production and staffing. As demand improves and production ramps back up, we will begin to return our employees to work on a measured basis. We also moved quickly to reduce our fixed costs, which historically have been approximately 25% of our total costs. We eliminated nonessential spending across the company. We postponed the investments we spoke about on the last earnings call, including network upgrades and enhancing our human resources organization and related technology. We implemented a 50% salary reduction for our senior executive officers and a 50% cut in the cash portion of our Board retainers. We expect these actions to reduce our fixed costs this year by approximately $130 million to $150 million, with a benefit in the second quarter of nearly $50 million. We deeply regret the impact of these measures on our employees affected by temporary layoffs, and we look forward to bringing them back to work as soon as we can. 
We also are closely monitoring all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. We also have taken steps to tightly control inventory. We dramatically reduced purchases and production levels, and in most cases, we have been fulfilling customer orders out of inventory. As demand has improved, we are in the process of increasing production in some of our businesses. Our Bedding products segment initially suffered the most rapid and steep decline in demand. Through mid-March, weekly average sales were approximately $45 million. In the final 2 weeks of the quarter, sales decreased by over 40% and 60% versus the weekly average. By the third week of the second quarter, sales were over 50% of the weekly average. Demand continued to improve last week. I anticipate that sales were roughly 65% to 70% of the average last week. The U.S. bedding industry has been severely impacted by widespread closures of traditional retailers as government shutdown orders went into place. E-commerce channels have fared somewhat better. 
In our Specialized Products segment, weekly sales averaged $20 million through mid-March. In the final 2 weeks of the first quarter, sales decreased roughly 50% as the pandemic spread across Europe and North America. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down over 60% as automotive OEM plants remain idle. Our Asian Automotive business was the first to experience declines as the Chinese government ordered shutdowns in late January. We restored most of our China production by the end of February but then faced a global decline in demand across all regions. Currently, all of our European and North American Automotive operations are idle, and our Asian facilities are operating at a reduced rate. In response, we significantly reduced fixed cost and variable costs across the business. In the European and North American automotive markets, we see several OEMs planning to restart production in mid-May. Regardless of when production resumes, we expect the supply chain restart to be complex and take time to ramp up. 
In the Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment, average weekly sales were slightly over $25 million throughout the first quarter. In the first 3 weeks of the second quarter, sales were down approximately 30% versus the weekly average. 
Looking forward, our strategic priorities for the second quarter are optimizing cash flow, understanding changes in demand and corresponding opportunities, and planning for expanded production across our operations as markets reopen and demand improves. 
In early March, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team that meets daily. We help our business leaders manage items such as responding to workplace health and safety issues, establishing protocols, interpreting government orders and securing personal protective equipment. The team developed a comprehensive handbook to document new work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate proper social distancing. Our business leaders are actively implementing training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. I am incredibly proud of our business leaders and the crisis response team. They have done a terrific job. They are collaborating, adapting and rising to the challenge. Their efforts will help all of our employees feel safe and be safe both today and as we ramp up production. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

The dec",572,"Thank you, Mitch, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to address the dividend. In keeping with their regular practice, our Board of Directors expect to make a decision on our second quarter dividend during the Board meeting later this month. The decision will take the evolving economic conditions into consideration. Next, as Mitch discussed in his comments, our primary financial focus since mid-March has been on generating cash, disciplined uses of cash and retaining liquidity in response to COVID-19 impacts. 
Commercial paper is our primary source of short-term liquidity. Our commercial paper program is backed by a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of leading banks. The credit facility's financial covenant is a debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. Prior to March 31, the covenant required debt to remain below 4.25x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. As of March 31, the covenant stepped down to 3.5x. This was a planned onetime stepdown when we increased the size of the credit facility in connection with our January 2019 acquisition of ECS. The stepdown effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility. The maximum that we can draw is now 3.5x the trailing 12-month EBITDA. At March 31, our debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility, equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $650 million. On March 31, our total liquidity was $734 million, comprised of $506 million in cash on hand and $228 million in available capacity under the commercial paper program. This past Friday, May 1, we had $372 million in remaining capacity under the revolver, with $278 million in commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average maturity of approximately 48 days and a weighted average interest rate of 2.53%. Because we do not know how long the significant demand decreases across our markets will continue, we are currently working with our bank group to amend covenants in our revolving credit facility. In addition, we have taken several steps to reduce our uses of cash for the remainder of the year. As Mitch discussed, we cut nonessential spending and reduced fixed costs by an estimated range of $130 million to $150 million, the large majority of which will benefit cash. We reduced our capital expenditure budget by over 60% to approximately $60 million for the year. We are halting acquisitions and our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year totaled $37.5 million. Importantly, we have no significant debt maturities until August 2022. We also expect a 2020 cash flow benefit of approximately $15 million from the payroll tax deferral provision of the Cares Act based on our latest estimates. This provision allows payment deferral of the employer portion of Social Security taxes for the remainder of 2020. These employer taxes will be paid over the following 2 years: half in 2021 and the other half in 2022. 
Concerning our credit exposure and risk, we increased our accounts receivable reserve in the first quarter. We recognized $12 million in bad debt expense, primarily from COVID-19 impacts on our customers and risk across our account portfolio, particularly among our bedding customers. If this situation persists, our credit exposure could continue to deteriorate. In summary, we remain committed to our balance sheet and are being proactive to maximize our liquidity as well as our flexibility through this uniquely uncertain time. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Karl for closing remarks."

We are extremely proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of our employees and how they have pulled together to support each other and their communities. Our employees are providing components for hospital beds and medical mattresses, helping solve supply chain issues and ventilator production, providing wire and fabric for face mask producers, and in some cases, converting our internal resources to face mask production. 
Finally, our Specialty Foam chemicals team has found a way to produce hand sanitizer to provide to our own facilities. 
To our employees, thank you for your dedication and resilience in these uncertain times. As Mitch and Jeff explained, and like so many of you in communities around the world, we are facing significant business challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These unprecedented circumstances have forced us to make very difficult decisions as we take steps to reduce costs during this period of drastic decreases in demand. The decisions to temporarily lay off a large number of our employees around the world was one of the most difficult of my career, as our strength has always been and will continue to be our people. Please know we are focused on doing everything we can to return our employees to work. Leggett has successfully navigated several challenging business and economic conditions in its storied 137-year history. Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company and are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Wendy."

But as Mitch mentioned in his comments, it's a very complicated supply chain, and it's going to take some time to work through here in the short term. So North America and Europe stopped very quickly and that left not much opportunity to build ahead any kind of inventory or critical components. So restarting the supply chain, which is starting this week, to some extent, will take pretty significant effort. There will be intermittent stoppages due to the interdependence of the supply chain, countries, states, all of the different restrictions that are out there right now hamper that from operating as effectively as it could. We believe we'll see it starting out with single shifts, shorter shifts, probably slower line rates and shifting content towards stuffed vehicles that are easier to build. We know our customers are going to have to proceed very carefully like us. They're going to have to monitor their employees, have PPE there for them, implement new processes. So we think it's going to start off slow, as these are kind of trial runs of the social distancing. A little further out, it will probably push model changeovers out a bit. So typically, there is a model change coming up here. EPA can't certify vehicles, costumers haven't been able to do the engineering and certification validations. So we can see those kinds of things push out 2 to 3 months. Longer term, we see that some of the macros of the industry of connected, autonomous and shared, are definitely going to be impacted in the short term, particularly around autonomous and shared vehicles. The return on autonomous is out too far, and shared just because of the COVID element of it. So we'll see many of those developments get pushed out a little further. Our belief is, though, the areas that we play in, in comfort and convenience, will matter more in the future regardless of where the market's headed, and we'll continue to be a pretty relevant supplier in the future. And this can take probably a few years to work its way through. So that's it for Automotive. 
In Aerospace, we held up pretty well in the first quarter. We were less impacted at the end of the first quarter, but we started to feel that a little bit going into Q2. Extreme disruptions to air travel, we expect that long-term aircraft production will be reduced because of passenger demand and also the airlines' financial condition. Both Boeing and Airbus have announced production cuts as a result, but we don't really know what that means at this time. But we are expecting that, again, this will take some time to work its way out."

But what we're hearing is the small independents, Bobby, are actually faring reasonably well. They tend to be in smaller communities that are less impacted and the sales through those channels have actually been stronger than average. So rural brick-and-mortar is doing fine. The larger, more heavily leveraged chains that had been impacted by private equity over the last few years are not faring as well because they're more highly levered. But long term, I think that there'll be a continued mix to e-commerce. We're certainly seeing that in e-commerce distribution being stronger than brick-and-mortar. But to your point and to your -- our shared concern is long-term post recovery, the goodness, the ability for product to be distributed through a supply chain ultimately to Mrs. Consumer in a way that is -- fits her preferences and her desires to experiencing the product and/or buy from -- in an omnichannel environment is important. But we haven't really seen a lot of negative impact. The fact that stores are starting to come back to live -- life, we've seen some early -- just in the last few days, a little bit of recovery in Home Furniture. The governor of California's announcement last night that he was going to start to open some retail distribution, certainly is positive. It depends on how that's all phased. But -- I rambled a whole lot, but Mitch is always more substantive than I am. But Mitch, do you have anything to add?"

That -- the question's better than the answer, that what we saw or what the industry saw is from a -- purely from a steel perspective -- scrap trade down pretty significantly in April. It looks like it's going to trade up in May because of the lack of availability of scrap. There's not a lot of scrap being collected at these low prices, and it's not being produced because of really no North American automotive production. And to Steve's point, that will start slowly. So it -- I would expect it's -- steel is always a supply and demand issue, and there's not a whole lot of demand. I would expect that steel cost will continue to stay somewhat muted but if demand picks up before supply, remembering there's a lot of productive capacity that's idled right now, we may see a couple of months of blip where costs do accelerate. On the input cost for Foam Chemicals, we're seeing deflation. But to be real honest with you, in that whole sector, there's not a whole lot of demand. So -- not everybody is able to make use of these lower input costs. So it's a great question. I'm not sure that we're confident that we're going to have the benefit from input cost deflation going into the back end of the year as people might think, purely because of supply and demand dynamics."

And it was very different in that the decline was slow and gradual, and we were -- we didn't have the kind of instantaneous cliff. We didn't have -- we had layoffs but not mass layoffs. We didn't have -- as a macro economy, we didn't have 30 million people file for unemployment in a 3-week period. So much of the demand that we experience is based on consumer confidence, and we have a consumer that doesn't know, frankly, what to think. So they're just completely different dynamics. What we don't know today is depth or duration. The company's ability to generate cash is significant. Jeff's answer was spot on, in that cash generation in 2Q should be really pretty good, but it all depends on demand in Q3 and 4 from a sales perspective and to be able to get that operating income married by cash generation, which is what we really experienced in 2008 and '09. So it's distinctly different. I will tell you that the portfolio is much healthier today than it was in that time frame. Big cash generation -- generators in the bedding supply chain in Automotive once it restarts. So we're in a better spot in a admittedly more difficult environment that's much more difficult to predict and is very uncertain with volatility. That's the -- it's maybe embarrassing for us not to be able to guide, but heck, we don't know if there's going to be a second wave. We just don't know. We're appreciative of the trends that we're experiencing in April. But I mean, heck, that doesn't mean that they'll continue. It always feels like we're 1 day away from bad news."

And pretty quickly got back up to 85%, 95% of our productive capacity by the end of February, and then the global demand just wasn't there. And so we haven't really seen the impact yet of the Asian or European loosening that's taken place from a demand perspective. I think that's still to come. Steve, anything that you would add or change?"

Before I proceed with the agenda, I wanted to let you know that today, after 22 years at Leggett and Platt, [indiscernible] will be leaving the company. Wendy began her career with Leggett in 1998 and  join the IR team in early 2017. She has done outstanding work in the IR role and brought tremendous value to Leggett in all of her past roles. Please join me in congratulating Wendy on her outstanding career with Haggett. We wish her great success as she moves on to a new exciting opportunity and the next stage of her career. She will be sincerely missed. 
Joining us for the first time today is Tara Sherwood, Director of IR. He will be working directly with Katy and me. Tara has been with Leggett since 2007 and has a strong background in accounting and financial analysis. Tara has held roles in internal audit and corporate development where she participated in some of the largest transactions in our history, including the acquisition and integration of ECS last year. We are excited to have Terra as the newest member of our IR team. The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a statement of the main points we made in yesterday's press release, Mitch will discuss demand trends and the status of our operations amid the many complexities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Jeff will discuss financial details. 
This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our Express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary detail of the key information we're sharing with you this morning, along with our regular quarterly financial information and segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call, including non-GAAP reconciliations. 
I need to remind you that remarks today concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results constitute forward-looking statements.

As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales were $845 million, down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019. EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower demand. A noncash goodwill impairment charge in our hydraulic cylinders business reduced second quarter EBIT by $25 million. EBIT was further reduced by approximately $3 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic related cost reductions. Second quarter earnings per share were a $0.05 loss, including $0.19 per share from the impairment charge and $0.02 per share from the restructuring. 
Adjusted EPS was $0.16, down from $0.64 in 2019. Our second quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were pleased to see sales improve sequentially throughout the quarter as demand improved in most of our markets. The swift cost reduction actions implemented at the onset of the pandemic helped to mitigate some of the earnings impact from lower demand levels. 
We continue to experience demand recovery throughout July, although it varied rates across our markets and geographies, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic and continuing economic uncertainty. We have improved our liquidity, and we continue to carefully manage our cash and balance sheet. We also reported yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share third quarter dividend. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our liquidity supports this decision. 
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families, along with our customers and suppliers and the communities we serve around the world. 
As Mitch will describe in more detail, we are focused on creating a safe work environment. I am extremely proud of how our employees are working together to keep each other safe and healthy while serving our customers during this challenging time. 
Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. 
Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future.

As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%, May sales were down almost 30%",949,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%, May sales were down almost 30%, and June sales were down just over 15%, all versus the prior year. 
We continue to see sequential improvement through the first 3 weeks of July with sales near prior year levels. As demand improved through the quarter, we ramped up most of our operations, implementing safety protocols, bringing employees back to work and tackling supply chain challenges. 
Given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy, we remain focused on keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels. As we discussed last quarter, we reacted quickly to reduce our fixed costs. These actions reduced our second quarter cost by nearly $40 million. 
At current demand levels, we now expect full year fixed cost savings of approximately $100 million. This is lower than the previous estimate of $130 million to $150 million as demand recovered faster and more robustly than expected in several of our markets. 
Sales in our Bedding products segment were down 28% in the second quarter. The reopening of brick-and-mortar retail locations and continuing strong e-commerce demand drove sequential improvement throughout the quarter with April sales down 54%, MACE sales down 20% and June sales down 14% versus prior year. 
The sequential demand improvements have continued with sales up 1% through the first 3 weeks of July. Demand in the U.S. betting market continues to be strong, sales in both U.S. Spring and ECS were positive year-over-year in June and through the first 3 weeks of July. 
Sales in our Specialized products segment were down 47% in the second quarter. We saw sequential improvements in this segment throughout the quarter as automotive OEMs restarted production in Europe and North America and production in Asia continued to improve. 
During the quarter, segment sales were down 63% in April, 54% in May and 29% in June versus 2019. The sequential demand improvements have continued, with sales down 13% through the first 3 weeks of July. In our automotive business, all regions are operational at varied levels of capacity. Our Asian facilities are operating at 90% of capacity. Our North American facilities are operating at 80% of capacity, and our European operations are at 70% of capacity. 
European and North American OEMs restarted production in May, and demand has increased sharply. North American sales have been driven by demand for trucks and SUVs. We are very pleased to see a recovery from the steep declines in April and May, but we are closely watching global demand trends as the economic impact from the pandemic remains unpredictable. 
Market demand in both aerospace and hydraulic cylinders held up initially, but declined in the later part of the quarter. We expect that aerospace demand will remain weak for some time given the many challenges in the industry. Demand signals for hydraulic cylinders are somewhat mixed at this point, but we are preparing for lower sales in this market as well. 
Sales in our furniture, Flooring and textile products segment were down 22% in the second quarter. This segment initially was less impacted by the pandemic than our other segments, primarily because of the strong demand in our KEO Textiles Components business. 
Fabric converting and flooring products also held up well, and home furniture improved as the quarter progressed. Recovery in work furniture has lagged the other businesses in this segment. Industry demand in this business may be challenged for some time as work environments change to meet evolving expectations of employers and employees. 
For the total segment, April sales were down 40% and May sales were down 22% and June sales were down 7% versus the prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued in July with sales up 7% for the first 3 weeks. 
Looking forward, our operational priorities for the third quarter are increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S. managing supply chain issues associated with the global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications and ongoing government restrictions on production in Mexico and India. Monitoring changes and monitoring changes in demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. We developed a layered approach to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to effectively reach all levels of the company. 
We focused on 4 primary work streams: safety and social distancing, communications, training and visual management, manufacturing layout and governance and compliance. As cases around the world continue to increase, we also have seen an increase in confirmed COVID cases in our facilities. 
Contact tracing indicates that while employees are contracting the virus in their local communities, our safety protocols are effective at preventing transmission of the virus among our employees at work. 
The health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority, and I'm pleased that our efforts are paying off. To our employees, I sincerely thank you for your dedication, ingenuity and resilience. The global pandemic has forced us to alter the ways we operate and interact with each other, our customers and our suppliers. You have found creative new ways to make it work. I know it makes your jobs more challenging on top of all the uncertainty that the pandemic brings to our personal lives. I'm incredibly proud of how we have pulled together across our businesses and corporate functions to overcome these challenges. Thank you very much for all your efforts. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the second quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. 
In early May, we amended our revolving credit agreement to change our financial covenant to a 4.75x net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. This change increased the availability under our revolving credit facility, which serves as the backup for our commercial paper program. 
As of June 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. On June 30, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion and was comprised of $209 million in cash on hand and $1.1 billion in available capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
Cash from operations was $112 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $60 million versus second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower earnings. We continue to monitor all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. 
Our primary focus is on customer collections. As an example, by the end of second quarter, the level of our accounts receivable and current status had improved and were consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. 
We're also taking steps to carefully control inventory levels as demand improves. Adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was 15.4% at the end of the quarter, which reflected a combination of very weak sales early in the quarter and working capital increases later in the quarter to support demand improvements. 
Regarding our uses of cash, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to approximate $60 million for the year. Dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. 
Our scheduled debt repayment for the remainder of the year are $25 million, and we're limiting our acquisition activity. 
In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing, we recognized a $25 million goodwill impairment of our hydraulic cylinders business. The impairment was primarily driven by the anticipated longer-term impacts of the global pandemic and is a complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. 
The goodwill impairment also resulted in an unusually high tax rate in the second quarter. This noncash expense is not deductible for tax purposes. 
After the impact from the impairment and the restructuring charge, as Karl discussed earlier, our second quarter adjusted tax rate is approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit rating and our position as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to take the necessary steps to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility as we navigate the current economic challenges. 
With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Susan."

I guess the first question I had, Karl, maybe was on a production and capacity side of things. We've heard from some other industry players that capacity was an issue as demand ramp back up pretty quickly during the quarter. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your capacity? Does that hinder growth or sales growth in 2Q? And kind of where are you at a capacity standpoint and backlog standpoint as we look at 3Q?"

I think that you're specifically asking in the area of the U.S. bedding business. So we'll go down that path that as you know, really what happened when things got so soft in April that we pulled down production, we were working off of inventory and then the second week of May, we started to see a surge of bedding demand in the U.S. not knowing if it was stimulus related or if it was a buildup to Memorial Day, at that point, didn't know if it was a head fake, to be real honest with you. And the demand has continued to be extremely strong. 
Interesting data point in the month of June, we shipped more innersprings in that month than any month in Leggett's history. Which is remarkable considering the backdrop. But as regards where we sit from a production capacity go forward what some of the issues are, mitch, why don't you take the details, if you don't mind?"

As Karl said, I think that demand is outpacing the overall capacity in the industry. So we're running full out. But there's a few challenges that I think we as well as, I think, everybody are facing. The first is labor. Just general availability across the U.S., especially as we try to ramp up second and third shifts as well as the loss of employees to quarantine in communities with large COVID outbreaks. 
We've seen this particularly in some parts of Georgia, Missouri, Texas and California. Right now, we seem to be doing a little bit better in that area, but it's a constant battle for us. The other big issue that I think the industry faces is availability of nonwoven fabrics. As I mentioned, the diversion of spunbond to medical PP&E has had a big impact. They're all alternatives, needle punch, but they're more expensive, slower to run and availability of those fabrics is still constrained. So I think that this problem is likely going to be with us for a while, probably well into next year. And with -- with demand outpacing supply, I think we continue to see non woven prices increase. And then I think the final element that comes into play is government restrictions in certain parts of the world. 
Today, Mexico is constraining our production capacity in a couple of our plants, impacting, particularly automotive and adjustable beds. And also some impact in India in automotive and PHC. So we're in short run and full out, but there's some challenges for us to deal with on a day-to-day basis."

What our customers are telling us that there's not cancellations of those orders, the consumer is forgiving and kind of understands the environment that we're working in. So there's -- just simply, it's a case where there's significantly more demand than there is supply. And to Mitch's point, we're working daily on trying to mitigate that.

And those declines happened despite the U.S. sales in May falling 26%.

But certainly, as I said, we saw some quick pickup when the stimulus checks were initially cut. And thought that it was stimulus driven, and we don't believe our customers are telling us that the demand continued so aggressively actually to this moment that they believe that it was not stimulus driven wholly, that it was driven by a consumer, at least in our bedding and home furniture markets that is very much focused on the home. And it's interesting that if you look at historically, consumer spending on travel and entertainment, that's $1 trillion of spending that isn't finding a home right now. So that's cruise lines, airfare, movie theaters, things like that. So the consumer is very focused on their home. We believe that, that bodes really well for the future. But the question really that we can't answer is with the, let's call them challenges or some people would call it dysfunction in Washington. What happens with extraordinary unemployment? And does that start to slow demand? We haven't seen any of that. We think that, like I said, home focus is driving that consumption. But frankly, we just don't know.

Please bear with us if you experience minor delays or mixed audio quality. 
On the call today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; and Mitch Dollof, President and COO; Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and CFO; Steve Henderson, EVP and President of the Specialized Products and Furniture , Flooring and Textile Products segment; Wendy Watson, Vice President of IR; and Cassie Branscum recently promoted to Senior Director of IR.  
Before I proceed with the agenda, I wanted to let you know that today, after 22 years at Leggett & Platt, Wendy will be leaving the company. Wendy began her career with Leggett in 1998 and joined the IR team in early 2017. She has done outstanding work in the IR role and brought tremendous value to Leggett in all of her past roles. Please join me in congratulating Wendy on her outstanding career with Leggett. We wish her great success as she moves on to a new exciting opportunity and the next stage of her career. She will be sincerely missed.  
Joining us for the first time today is Tarah Sherwood, Director of IR. She will be working directly with Cassie and me. Tarah has been with Leggett since 2007 and has a strong background in accounting and financial analysis. Tarah has held roles in internal audit and corporate development where she participated in some of the largest transactions in our history, including the acquisition and integration of ECS last year. We are excited to have Tarah as the newest member of our IR team. 
The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a statement of the main points we made in yesterday's press release, Mitch will discuss demand trends and the status of our operations amid the many complexities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Jeff will discuss financial details.  
This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary detail of the key information we're sharing with you this morning, along with our regular quarterly financial information and segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call including non-GAAP reconciliations.

As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales were $845 million, down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019. EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower demand. A noncash goodwill impairment charge in our Hydraulic Cylinders business reduced second quarter EBIT by $25 million. EBIT was further reduced by approximately $3 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic-related cost reductions. Second quarter earnings per share were a $0.05 loss, including $0.19 per share from the impairment charge and $0.02 per share from the restructuring.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.16, down from $0.64 in 2019. Our second quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were pleased to see sales improve sequentially throughout the quarter as demand improved in most of our markets. The swift cost reduction actions implemented at the onset of the pandemic helped to mitigate some of the earnings impact from lower demand levels.  
We continue to experience demand recovery throughout July, although at varied rates across our markets and geographies, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic and continuing economic uncertainty. We have improved our liquidity, and we continue to carefully manage our cash and balance sheet. We also reported yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share third quarter dividend. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our liquidity supports this decision.  
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families, along with our customers and suppliers and the communities we serve around the world. As Mitch will describe in more detail, we are focused on creating a safe work environment. I am extremely proud of how our employees are working together to keep each other safe and healthy while serving our customers during this challenging time. 
Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future.  
I'll now turn the call over to Mitch."

As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%",945,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%, and June sales were down just over 15%, all versus the prior year.  
We continue to see sequential improvement through the first 3 weeks of July with sales near prior year levels. As demand improved through the quarter, we ramped up most of our operations, implementing safety protocols, bringing employees back to work and tackling supply chain challenges.  
Given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy, we remain focused on keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels. As we discussed last quarter, we reacted quickly to reduce our fixed costs. These actions reduced our second quarter cost by nearly $40 million. At current demand levels, we now expect full year fixed cost savings of approximately $100 million. This is lower than the previous estimate of $130 million to $150 million as demand recovered faster and more robustly than expected in several of our markets. Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 28% in the second quarter. The reopening of brick-and-mortar retail locations and continuing strong e-commerce demand drove sequential improvement throughout the quarter with April sales down 54%, May sales down 20% and June sales down 14% versus prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued with sales up 1% through the first 3 weeks of July. Demand in the U.S. bedding market continues to be strong, sales in both U.S. Spring and ECS were positive year-over-year in June and through the first 3 weeks of July. Sales in our Specialized Products segment were down 47% in the second quarter. We saw sequential improvements in this segment throughout the quarter as automotive OEMs restarted production in Europe and North America and production in Asia continued to improve. During the quarter, segment sales were down 63% in April, 54% in May and 29% in June versus 2019. The sequential demand improvements have continued, with sales down 13% through the first 3 weeks of July. 
In our Automotive business, all regions are operational at varied levels of capacity. Our Asian facilities are operating at 90% of capacity. Our North American facilities they're operating at 80% of capacity and our European operations are at 70% of capacity. European and North American OEMs restarted production in May, and demand has increased sharply. North American sales have been driven by demand for trucks and SUVs. We are very pleased to see a recovery from the steep declines in April and May, but we are closely watching global demand trends as the economic impact from the pandemic remains unpredictable. Market demand in both Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders held up initially but declined in the later part of the quarter. We expect that Aerospace demand will remain weak for some time given the many challenges in the industry. Demand signals for Hydraulic Cylinders are somewhat mixed at this point, but we are preparing for lower sales in this market as well. 
Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were down 22% in the second quarter. This segment initially was less impacted by the pandemic than our other segments, primarily because of the strong demand in our Geotextiles Components business. Fabric Converting and Flooring products also held up well, and Home Furniture improved as the quarter progressed. 
Recovery in Work Furniture has lagged the other businesses in this segment. Industry demand in this business may be challenged for some time as work environments change to meet evolving expectations of employers and employees. 
For the total segment, April sales were down 40% and May sales were down 22% and June sales were down 7% versus the prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued in July with sales up 7% for the first 3 weeks. 
Looking forward, our operational priorities for the third quarter are increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing supply chain issues associated with the global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications, and ongoing government restrictions on production in Mexico and India, and monitoring changes in demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. 
We developed a layered approach to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to effectively reach all levels of the company. We focused on 4 primary workstreams: safety and social distancing, communications, training and visual management, manufacturing layout and governance and compliance. As cases around the world continue to increase, we also have seen an increase in confirmed COVID cases in our facilities. Contact tracing indicates that while employees are contracting the virus in their local communities, our safety protocols are effective at preventing transmission of the virus among our employees at work. 
The health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority, and I'm pleased that our efforts are paying off. To our employees, I sincerely thank you for your dedication, ingenuity and resilience. The global pandemic has forced us to alter the ways we operate and interact with each other, our customers and our suppliers. You have found creative new ways to make it work. I know it makes your jobs more challenging on top of all the uncertainty that the pandemic brings to our personal lives. I'm incredibly proud of how we have pulled together across our businesses and corporate functions to overcome these challenges. Thank you very much for all your efforts. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the second quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. In early May, we amended our revolving credit agreement to change our financial covenant to a 4.75x net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. This change increased the availability under our revolving credit facility, which serves as the backup for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. On June 30, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion and was comprised of $209 million in cash on hand and $1.1 billion in available capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
Cash from operations was $112 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $60 million versus second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower earnings. We continue to monitor all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. As an example, by the end of second quarter, the level of our accounts receivable and current status had improved and were consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We're also taking steps to carefully control inventory levels as demand improves. 
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was 15.4% at the end of the quarter, which reflected a combination of very weak sales early in the quarter and working capital increases later in the quarter to support demand improvements. Regarding our uses of cash, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to approximate $60 million for the year. Dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. Our scheduled debt repayment for the remainder of the year are $25 million, and we're limiting our acquisition activity. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing, we recognized a $25 million goodwill impairment of our Hydraulic Cylinders business. The impairment was primarily driven by the anticipated longer-term impacts of the global pandemic and as a complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. The goodwill impairment also resulted in an unusually high tax rate in the second quarter. This noncash expense is not deductible for tax purposes. After the impact from the impairment and the restructuring charges, Karl discussed earlier, our second quarter adjusted tax rate is approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit rating and our position as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to take the necessary steps to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility as we navigate the current economic challenges. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Susan."

I think that you're specifically asking in the area of the U.S. Bedding business. So we'll go down that path that as you know, really what happened when things got so soft in April that we pulled down production, we were working off of inventory and then the second week of May, we started to see a surge of bedding demand in the U.S. not knowing if it was stimulus related or if it was a buildup to Memorial Day, at that point, didn't know if it was a head fake, to be real honest with you. And the demand has continued to be extremely strong. Interesting data point in the month of June, we shipped more innersprings in that month than any month in Leggett's history. Which is remarkable considering the backdrop. But as regards where we sit from a production capacity go forward with some of the issues are?

As Karl said, I think that demand is outpacing the overall capacity in the industry. So we're running full out. But there's a few challenges that I think we as well as, I think, everybody are facing. The first is labor. Just general availability across the U.S., especially as we try to ramp up second and third shifts as well as the loss of employees to quarantine in communities with large COVID outbreaks.  We've seen this particularly in some parts of Georgia, Missouri, Texas and California. Right now, we seem to be doing a little bit better in that area, but it's a constant battle for us. 
The other big issue that I think the industry faces is availability of nonwoven fabrics. As I mentioned, the diversion of spunbond to medical PP&E has had a big impact. They're all alternatives, needle punch, but they're more expensive, slower to run and availability of those fabrics is still constrained. So I think that this problem is likely going to be with us for a while, probably well into next year. And with -- with demand outpacing supply, I think we continue to see nonwoven prices increase. 
And then I think the final element that comes into play is government restrictions in certain parts of the world. Today, Mexico is constraining our production capacity in a couple of our plants, impacting, particularly automotive and adjustable beds. And also some impact in India in automotive and PHC. So we're in short running full out, but there's some challenges for us to deal with on a day-to-day basis."

And obviously, with all the conversations that are happening today in Washington around the next level of stimulus activity and the potential that maybe there's a gap that comes in there. How are you thinking about what that could mean for demand? And this level of activity that you're seeing today?"

But certainly, as I said, we saw some quick pickup when the stimulus checks were initially cut. And thought that it was stimulus-driven. And we don't believe our customers are telling us that the demand continued so aggressively actually to this moment that they believe that it was not stimulus-driven wholly, that it was driven by a consumer, at least in our Bedding and Home Furniture markets that is very much focused on the home. And it's interesting that if you look at historically, consumer spending on travel and entertainment, that's $1 trillion of spending that isn't finding a home right now. So that's cruise lines, airfare, movie theaters, things like that. So the consumer is very focused on their home. We believe that, that bodes really well for the future. But the question really that we can't answer is with the, let's call them challenges or some people would call it dysfunction in Washington. What happens with extraordinary unemployment? And does that start to slow demand? We haven't seen any of that. We think that, like I said, home focus is driving that consumption. But frankly, we just don't know. I mean there's -- that's part of why we don't give guidance. We're appreciative of every order that we take and the margins associated with that and the goodness that it provides for our employees from a safety of job, but the visibility into the future is really tough to forecast."

So I believe bedding, home furniture. Certainly, the housing statistics bode well for our Flooring business. The Hanes businesses in both Geo Components and on the Converting side, that it's highly correlated to home focus, some PPE manufacturing. So those businesses, we have every expectation will continue to do really well. There may be a little bit of a head fake for some of you in that. If you think of our Bedding segment, you might think of it as U.S. Spring, ECS in that bedding business where it's much broader. It has some industrial materials business, which is soft, and we expect that to continue to be soft. And I actually aired when I said U.S. Bedding, I do mean not only the Spring business but ECS. ECS is doing a terrific job and that business is growing at a faster rate than U.S. Spring, but -- so those are the positives.

It's a relatively small part of our overall business, pretty nimble and fairly diverse actually across our customer base. So we'll hang in there and see what we can do to adjust in the face of that softer demand. And then I think, Work Furniture probably will see  less of an extreme decline in demand but certainly, probably will lag returning to levels that we've seen in the prior years. Remember that we participate both from like task chair part of the industry, more traditional office but also a lot on the collaborative soft seating side. And so we'll see how that plays out as people adjust their work whether it's at home or how they work in the office, their may be some opportunities there.

And that continues to give us opportunities to play in the future, although the timing of some of that may have changed. So industry will continue to recover. We expect a pretty significant increase into 2021 if things hold up the way we are planning. And then longer term, our strategies, our product development seem to be right on target for customers."

On the call today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; and Mitch Dollof, President and COO; Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and CFO; Steve Henderson, EVP and President of the Specialized Products and Furniture , Flooring and Textile Products segment; Wendy Watson, Vice President of IR; and Cassie Branscum recently promoted to Senior Director of IR.  
Before I proceed with the agenda, I wanted to let you know that today, after 22 years at Leggett & Platt, Wendy will be leaving the company. Wendy began her career with Leggett in 1998 and joined the IR team in early 2017. She has done outstanding work in the IR role and brought tremendous value to Leggett in all of her past roles. Please join me in congratulating Wendy on her outstanding career with Leggett. We wish her great success as she moves on to a new exciting opportunity and the next stage of her career. She will be sincerely missed.  
Joining us for the first time today is Tarah Sherwood, Director of IR. She will be working directly with Cassie and me. Tarah has been with Leggett since 2007 and has a strong background in accounting and financial analysis. Tarah has held roles in internal audit and corporate development where she participated in some of the largest transactions in our history, including the acquisition and integration of ECS last year. We are excited to have Tarah as the newest member of our IR team. 
The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a statement of the main points we made in yesterday's press release, Mitch will discuss demand trends and the status of our operations amid the many complexities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Jeff will discuss financial details.  
This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary detail of the key information we're sharing with you this morning, along with our regular quarterly financial information and segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call including non-GAAP reconciliations.

As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales were $845 million, down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019. EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower demand. A noncash goodwill impairment charge in our Hydraulic Cylinders business reduced second quarter EBIT by $25 million. EBIT was further reduced by approximately $3 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic-related cost reductions. Second quarter earnings per share were a $0.05 loss, including $0.19 per share from the impairment charge and $0.02 per share from the restructuring.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.16, down from $0.64 in 2019. Our second quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were pleased to see sales improve sequentially throughout the quarter as demand improved in most of our markets. The swift cost reduction actions implemented at the onset of the pandemic helped to mitigate some of the earnings impact from lower demand levels.  
We continue to experience demand recovery throughout July, although at varied rates across our markets and geographies, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic and continuing economic uncertainty. We have improved our liquidity, and we continue to carefully manage our cash and balance sheet. We also reported yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share third quarter dividend. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our liquidity supports this decision.  
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families, along with our customers and suppliers and the communities we serve around the world. As Mitch will describe in more detail, we are focused on creating a safe work environment. I am extremely proud of how our employees are working together to keep each other safe and healthy while serving our customers during this challenging time. 
Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company, and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future.  
I'll now turn the call over to Mitch."

As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%",945,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%, and June sales were down just over 15%, all versus the prior year.  
We continue to see sequential improvement through the first 3 weeks of July with sales near prior year levels. As demand improved through the quarter, we ramped up most of our operations, implementing safety protocols, bringing employees back to work and tackling supply chain challenges.  
Given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy, we remain focused on keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels. As we discussed last quarter, we reacted quickly to reduce our fixed costs. These actions reduced our second quarter cost by nearly $40 million. At current demand levels, we now expect full year fixed cost savings of approximately $100 million. This is lower than the previous estimate of $130 million to $150 million as demand recovered faster and more robustly than expected in several of our markets. Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 28% in the second quarter. The reopening of brick-and-mortar retail locations and continuing strong e-commerce demand drove sequential improvement throughout the quarter with April sales down 54%, May sales down 20% and June sales down 14% versus prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued with sales up 1% through the first 3 weeks of July. Demand in the U.S. bedding market continues to be strong, sales in both U.S. Spring and ECS were positive year-over-year in June and through the first 3 weeks of July. Sales in our Specialized Products segment were down 47% in the second quarter. We saw sequential improvements in this segment throughout the quarter as automotive OEMs restarted production in Europe and North America and production in Asia continued to improve. During the quarter, segment sales were down 63% in April, 54% in May and 29% in June versus 2019. The sequential demand improvements have continued, with sales down 13% through the first 3 weeks of July. 
In our Automotive business, all regions are operational at varied levels of capacity. Our Asian facilities are operating at 90% of capacity. Our North American facilities they're operating at 80% of capacity and our European operations are at 70% of capacity. European and North American OEMs restarted production in May, and demand has increased sharply. North American sales have been driven by demand for trucks and SUVs. We are very pleased to see a recovery from the steep declines in April and May, but we are closely watching global demand trends as the economic impact from the pandemic remains unpredictable. Market demand in both Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders held up initially but declined in the later part of the quarter. We expect that Aerospace demand will remain weak for some time given the many challenges in the industry. Demand signals for Hydraulic Cylinders are somewhat mixed at this point, but we are preparing for lower sales in this market as well. 
Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were down 22% in the second quarter. This segment initially was less impacted by the pandemic than our other segments, primarily because of the strong demand in our Geotextiles Components business. Fabric Converting and Flooring products also held up well, and Home Furniture improved as the quarter progressed. 
Recovery in Work Furniture has lagged the other businesses in this segment. Industry demand in this business may be challenged for some time as work environments change to meet evolving expectations of employers and employees. 
For the total segment, April sales were down 40% and May sales were down 22% and June sales were down 7% versus the prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued in July with sales up 7% for the first 3 weeks. 
Looking forward, our operational priorities for the third quarter are increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing supply chain issues associated with the global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications, and ongoing government restrictions on production in Mexico and India, and monitoring changes in demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. 
We developed a layered approach to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to effectively reach all levels of the company. We focused on 4 primary workstreams: safety and social distancing, communications, training and visual management, manufacturing layout and governance and compliance. As cases around the world continue to increase, we also have seen an increase in confirmed COVID cases in our facilities. Contact tracing indicates that while employees are contracting the virus in their local communities, our safety protocols are effective at preventing transmission of the virus among our employees at work. 
The health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority, and I'm pleased that our efforts are paying off. To our employees, I sincerely thank you for your dedication, ingenuity and resilience. The global pandemic has forced us to alter the ways we operate and interact with each other, our customers and our suppliers. You have found creative new ways to make it work. I know it makes your jobs more challenging on top of all the uncertainty that the pandemic brings to our personal lives. I'm incredibly proud of how we have pulled together across our businesses and corporate functions to overcome these challenges. Thank you very much for all your efforts. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the second quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. In early May, we amended our revolving credit agreement to change our financial covenant to a 4.75x net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. This change increased the availability under our revolving credit facility, which serves as the backup for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. On June 30, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion and was comprised of $209 million in cash on hand and $1.1 billion in available capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
Cash from operations was $112 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $60 million versus second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower earnings. We continue to monitor all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. As an example, by the end of second quarter, the level of our accounts receivable and current status had improved and were consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We're also taking steps to carefully control inventory levels as demand improves. 
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was 15.4% at the end of the quarter, which reflected a combination of very weak sales early in the quarter and working capital increases later in the quarter to support demand improvements. Regarding our uses of cash, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to approximate $60 million for the year. Dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. Our scheduled debt repayment for the remainder of the year are $25 million, and we're limiting our acquisition activity. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing, we recognized a $25 million goodwill impairment of our Hydraulic Cylinders business. The impairment was primarily driven by the anticipated longer-term impacts of the global pandemic and as a complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. The goodwill impairment also resulted in an unusually high tax rate in the second quarter. This noncash expense is not deductible for tax purposes. After the impact from the impairment and the restructuring charges, Karl discussed earlier, our second quarter adjusted tax rate is approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit rating and our position as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to take the necessary steps to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility as we navigate the current economic challenges. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Susan."

I think that you're specifically asking in the area of the U.S. Bedding business. So we'll go down that path that as you know, really what happened when things got so soft in April that we pulled down production, we were working off of inventory and then the second week of May, we started to see a surge of bedding demand in the U.S. not knowing if it was stimulus related or if it was a buildup to Memorial Day, at that point, didn't know if it was a head fake, to be real honest with you. And the demand has continued to be extremely strong. Interesting data point in the month of June, we shipped more innersprings in that month than any month in Leggett's history. Which is remarkable considering the backdrop. But as regards where we sit from a production capacity go forward with some of the issues are?

As Karl said, I think that demand is outpacing the overall capacity in the industry. So we're running full out. But there's a few challenges that I think we as well as, I think, everybody are facing. The first is labor. Just general availability across the U.S., especially as we try to ramp up second and third shifts as well as the loss of employees to quarantine in communities with large COVID outbreaks.  We've seen this particularly in some parts of Georgia, Missouri, Texas and California. Right now, we seem to be doing a little bit better in that area, but it's a constant battle for us. 
The other big issue that I think the industry faces is availability of nonwoven fabrics. As I mentioned, the diversion of spunbond to medical PP&E has had a big impact. They're all alternatives, needle punch, but they're more expensive, slower to run and availability of those fabrics is still constrained. So I think that this problem is likely going to be with us for a while, probably well into next year. And with -- with demand outpacing supply, I think we continue to see nonwoven prices increase. 
And then I think the final element that comes into play is government restrictions in certain parts of the world. Today, Mexico is constraining our production capacity in a couple of our plants, impacting, particularly automotive and adjustable beds. And also some impact in India in automotive and PHC. So we're in short running full out, but there's some challenges for us to deal with on a day-to-day basis."

And as Mitch was mentioning in his comments, there are some models, particularly some trucks and SUVs where production is needed to increase those products and the dealers lots are becoming fairly limited supply."

But certainly, as I said, we saw some quick pickup when the stimulus checks were initially cut. And thought that it was stimulus-driven. And we don't believe our customers are telling us that the demand continued so aggressively actually to this moment that they believe that it was not stimulus-driven wholly, that it was driven by a consumer, at least in our Bedding and Home Furniture markets that is very much focused on the home. And it's interesting that if you look at historically, consumer spending on travel and entertainment, that's $1 trillion of spending that isn't finding a home right now. So that's cruise lines, airfare, movie theaters, things like that. So the consumer is very focused on their home. We believe that, that bodes really well for the future. But the question really that we can't answer is with the, let's call them challenges or some people would call it dysfunction in Washington. What happens with extraordinary unemployment? And does that start to slow demand? We haven't seen any of that. We think that, like I said, home focus is driving that consumption. But frankly, we just don't know. I mean there's -- that's part of why we don't give guidance. We're appreciative of every order that we take and the margins associated with that and the goodness that it provides for our employees from a safety of job, but the visibility into the future is really tough to forecast."

So I believe bedding, home furniture. Certainly, the housing statistics bode well for our Flooring business. The Hanes businesses in both Geo Components and on the Converting side, that it's highly correlated to home focus, some PPE manufacturing. So those businesses, we have every expectation will continue to do really well. There may be a little bit of a head fake for some of you in that. If you think of our Bedding segment, you might think of it as U.S. Spring, ECS in that bedding business where it's much broader. It has some industrial materials business, which is soft, and we expect that to continue to be soft. And I actually aired when I said U.S. Bedding, I do mean not only the Spring business but ECS. ECS is doing a terrific job and that business is growing at a faster rate than U.S. Spring, but -- so those are the positives.

Peter, I think you are right, I mean the -- our Aerospace business is likely to remain challenged as that industry sort of sorts through the many difficulties that are there. It's a relatively small part of our overall business, pretty nimble and fairly diverse actually across our customer base. So we'll hang in there and see what we can do to adjust in the face of that softer demand. And then I think, Work Furniture probably will see  less of an extreme decline in demand but certainly, probably will lag returning to levels that we've seen in the prior years. Remember that we participate both from like task chair part of the industry, more traditional office but also a lot on the collaborative soft seating side. And so we'll see how that plays out as people adjust their work whether it's at home or how they work in the office, their may be some opportunities there.

We don't have the kind of visibility that we'd like to have going forward. What we are seeing in Q3 is the demand continues to increase as we've seen before, but going out into Q4 and beyond, we rely on industry experts such as IHS. And IHS is saying that we'll continue to see the recovery through Q3 and Q4 to roughly 90% of normal or 2019 levels, and we should see that recovery continue into 2021, being up about 13% over their forecast for 2020. So continued improvement in the market, but it's going to take several years to get back to the 2019 levels. 
The positive side for the business is the models that are in the highest demand are also the highest content vehicles. So that plays well for Leggett over the long haul. The industry trends in terms of sustainability, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, are all still in play, although some of that is being pushed out. And that continues to give us opportunities to play in the future, although the timing of some of that may have changed. So industry will continue to recover. We expect a pretty significant increase into 2021 if things hold up the way we are planning. And then longer term, our strategies, our product development seem to be right on target for customers."

On the call today are Karl Glassman, Chairman and CEO; and Mitch Dollof, President and COO; Jeff Tate, Executive Vice President and CFO; Steve Henderson, EVP and President of the Specialized Products and Furniture , Flooring and Textile Products segment; Wendy Watson, Vice President of IR; and Cassie Branscum recently promoted to Senior Director of IR.  
Before I proceed with the agenda, I wanted to let you know that today, after 22 years at Leggett & Platt, Wendy will be leaving the company. Wendy began her career with Leggett in 1998 and joined the IR team in early 2017. She has done outstanding work in the IR role and brought tremendous value to Leggett in all of her past roles. Please join me in congratulating Wendy on her outstanding career with Leggett. We wish her great success as she moves on to a new exciting opportunity and the next stage of her career. She will be sincerely missed.  
Joining us for the first time today is Tarah Sherwood, Director of IR. She will be working directly with Cassie and me. Tarah has been with Leggett since 2007 and has a strong background in accounting and financial analysis. Tarah has held roles in internal audit and corporate development where she participated in some of the largest transactions in our history, including the acquisition and integration of ECS last year. We are excited to have Tarah as the newest member of our IR team. 
The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Karl will start with a statement of the main points we made in yesterday's press release, Mitch will discuss demand trends and the status of our operations amid the many complexities driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Jeff will discuss financial details.  
This conference call is being recorded for Leggett & Platt and is copyrighted material. This call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our express permission. A replay is available from the IR portion of Leggett's website. We posted to the Investor Relations portion of the website yesterday's press release and a set of PowerPoint slides that contain summary detail of the key information we're sharing with you this morning, along with our regular quarterly financial information and segment details. Those documents supplement the information we discuss on this call including non-GAAP reconciliations.

As we reported yesterday, second quarter sales were $845 million, down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019. EBIT decreased in the quarter versus second quarter last year, primarily due to lower demand. A noncash goodwill impairment charge in our Hydraulic Cylinders business reduced second quarter EBIT by $25 million. EBIT was further reduced by approximately $3 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic-related cost reductions. Second quarter earnings per share were a $0.05 loss, including $0.19 per share from the impairment charge and $0.02 per share from the restructuring.  
Adjusted EPS was $0.16, down from $0.64 in 2019. Our second quarter results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were pleased to see sales improve sequentially throughout the quarter as demand improved in most of our markets. The swift cost reduction actions implemented at the onset of the pandemic helped to mitigate some of the earnings impact from lower demand levels.  
We continue to experience demand recovery throughout July, although at varied rates across our markets and geographies, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic and continuing economic uncertainty. We have improved our liquidity and we continue to carefully manage our cash and balance sheet. We also reported yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share third quarter dividend. We recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders and our liquidity supports this decision.  
Our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families, along with our customers and suppliers and the communities we serve around the world. As Mitch will describe in more detail, we are focused on creating a safe work environment. I am extremely proud of how our employees are working together to keep each other safe and healthy while serving our customers during this challenging time. 
Our long-term fundamentals have not changed. We continue to be leaders in most of our markets, focused on innovation and working closely with our customers to provide more of what they need to be successful. Our capabilities are unmatched in our large and expanding addressable markets. The diversity of our businesses makes us stronger. We have an outstanding track record of strong cash flow and we remain committed to our long-standing transparency and financial discipline. We are dedicated to our long-term vision for the company and we are confident that we will emerge from this crisis strong and focused on the future.  
I'll now turn the call over to Mitch."

As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%",945,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As mentioned, sales in the second quarter were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2019, with demand improving each month throughout the quarter. April sales were down over 50%. May sales were down almost 30%, and June sales were down just over 15%, all versus the prior year.  
We continue to see sequential improvement through the first 3 weeks of July with sales near prior year levels. As demand improved through the quarter, we ramped up most of our operations, implementing safety protocols, bringing employees back to work and tackling supply chain challenges.  
Given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy, we remain focused on keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels. As we discussed last quarter, we reacted quickly to reduce our fixed costs. These actions reduced our second quarter cost by nearly $40 million. At current demand levels, we now expect full year fixed cost savings of approximately $100 million. This is lower than the previous estimate of $130 million to $150 million as demand recovered faster and more robustly than expected in several of our markets. Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 28% in the second quarter. The reopening of brick-and-mortar retail locations and continuing strong e-commerce demand drove sequential improvement throughout the quarter with April sales down 54%, May sales down 20% and June sales down 14% versus prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued with sales up 1% through the first 3 weeks of July. Demand in the U.S. bedding market continues to be strong, sales in both U.S. Spring and ECS were positive year-over-year in June and through the first 3 weeks of July. Sales in our Specialized Products segment were down 47% in the second quarter. We saw sequential improvements in this segment throughout the quarter as automotive OEMs restarted production in Europe and North America and production in Asia continued to improve. During the quarter, segment sales were down 63% in April, 54% in May and 29% in June versus 2019. The sequential demand improvements have continued, with sales down 13% through the first 3 weeks of July. 
In our Automotive business, all regions are operational at varied levels of capacity. Our Asian facilities are operating at 90% of capacity. Our North American facilities they're operating at 80% of capacity and our European operations are at 70% of capacity. European and North American OEMs restarted production in May and demand has increased sharply. North American sales have been driven by demand for trucks and SUVs. We are very pleased to see a recovery from the steep declines in April and May, but we are closely watching global demand trends as the economic impact from the pandemic remains unpredictable. Market demand in both Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders held up initially but declined in the later part of the quarter. We expect that Aerospace demand will remain weak for some time given the many challenges in the industry. Demand signals for Hydraulic Cylinders are somewhat mixed at this point, but we are preparing for lower sales in this market as well. 
Sales in our Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products segment were down 22% in the second quarter. This segment initially was less impacted by the pandemic than our other segments, primarily because of the strong demand in our Geotextiles Components business. Fabric Converting and Flooring products also held up well and Home Furniture improved as the quarter progressed. 
Recovery in Work Furniture has lagged the other businesses in this segment. Industry demand in this business may be challenged for some time as work environments change to meet evolving expectations of employers and employees. 
For the total segment, April sales were down 40% and May sales were down 22% and June sales were down 7% versus the prior year. The sequential demand improvements have continued in July with sales up 7% for the first 3 weeks. 
Looking forward, our operational priorities for the third quarter are increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing supply chain issues associated with the global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications, and ongoing government restrictions on production in Mexico and India, and monitoring changes in demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. 
We developed a layered approach to manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to effectively reach all levels of the company. We focused on 4 primary workstreams: safety and social distancing, communications, training and visual management, manufacturing layout and governance and compliance. As cases around the world continue to increase, we also have seen an increase in confirmed COVID cases in our facilities. Contact tracing indicates that while employees are contracting the virus in their local communities, our safety protocols are effective at preventing transmission of the virus among our employees at work. 
The health and safety of our employees is our #1 priority and I'm pleased that our efforts are paying off. To our employees, I sincerely thank you for your dedication, ingenuity and resilience. The global pandemic has forced us to alter the ways we operate and interact with each other, our customers and our suppliers. You have found creative new ways to make it work. I know it makes your jobs more challenging on top of all the uncertainty that the pandemic brings to our personal lives. I'm incredibly proud of how we have pulled together across our businesses and corporate functions to overcome these challenges. Thank you very much for all your efforts. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the second quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. In early May, we amended our revolving credit agreement to change our financial covenant to a 4.75x net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA metric. This change increased the availability under our revolving credit facility, which serves as the backup for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA, as defined in our revolving credit facility equated to a maximum borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion. On June 30, our total liquidity was $1.3 billion and was comprised of $209 million in cash on hand and $1.1 billion in available capacity under the revolving credit facility. 
Cash from operations was $112 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $60 million versus second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower earnings. We continue to monitor all elements of working capital in order to optimize cash flow. Our primary focus is on customer collections. As an example, by the end of second quarter, the level of our accounts receivable and current status had improved and were consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels. We're also taking steps to carefully control inventory levels as demand improves. 
Adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales was 15.4% at the end of the quarter, which reflected a combination of very weak sales early in the quarter and working capital increases later in the quarter to support demand improvements. Regarding our uses of cash, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to approximate $60 million for the year. Dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. Our scheduled debt repayment for the remainder of the year are $25 million, and we're limiting our acquisition activity. In connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing, we recognized a $25 million goodwill impairment of our Hydraulic Cylinders business. The impairment was primarily driven by the anticipated longer-term impacts of the global pandemic and as a complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business. The goodwill impairment also resulted in an unusually high tax rate in the second quarter. This noncash expense is not deductible for tax purposes. After the impact from the impairment and the restructuring charges, Karl discussed earlier, our second quarter adjusted tax rate is approximately 29%. 
So in summary, we remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet, investment-grade credit rating and our position as a dividend aristocrat. We continue to take the necessary steps to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility as we navigate the current economic challenges. With those comments, I'll turn the call back over to Susan."

So we'll go down that path that as you know, really what happened when things got so soft in April that we pulled down production, we were working off of inventory and then the second week of May, we started to see a surge of bedding demand in the U.S. not knowing if it was stimulus related or if it was a buildup to Memorial Day, at that point, didn't know if it was a head fake, to be real honest with you. And the demand has continued to be extremely strong. Interesting data point in the month of June, we shipped more innersprings in that month than any month in Leggett's history. Which is remarkable considering the backdrop. But as regards where we sit from a production capacity go forward with some of the issues are?

As Karl said, I think that demand is outpacing the overall capacity in the industry. So we're running full out. But there's a few challenges that I think we as well as, I think, everybody are facing. The first is labor. Just general availability across the U.S., especially as we try to ramp up second and third shifts as well as the loss of employees to quarantine in communities with large COVID outbreaks.  We've seen this particularly in some parts of Georgia, Missouri, Texas and California. Right now, we seem to be doing a little bit better in that area, but it's a constant battle for us. 
The other big issue that I think the industry faces is availability of nonwoven fabrics. As I mentioned, the diversion of spunbond to medical PP&E has had a big impact. They're all alternatives, needle punch, but they're more expensive, slower to run and availability of those fabrics is still constrained. So I think that this problem is likely going to be with us for a while, probably well into next year. And with -- with demand outpacing supply, I think we continue to see nonwoven prices increase. 
And then I think the final element that comes into play is government restrictions in certain parts of the world. Today, Mexico is constraining our production capacity in a couple of our plants, impacting, particularly automotive and adjustable beds. And also some impact in India in automotive and PHC. So we're in short running full out, but there's some challenges for us to deal with on a day-to-day basis."

Yes, from an Automotive perspective, the last information we have is from June and the June inventory numbers were just about 2.6 million units or 58 days supply. So well within the range of the targets actually towards the lower end. And that's down about 1.3 million units from June of last year or about 30%, 33%. And those declines happened despite the U.S. sales in May falling 26%. So really, what's kind of happened is the COVID factory shutdowns have kind of helped self-correct the inventory levels in about 2 months. And as Mitch was mentioning in his comments, there are some models, particularly some trucks and SUVs where production is needed to increase those products and the dealers’ lots are becoming fairly limited supply."

But certainly, as I said, we saw some quick pickup when the stimulus checks were initially cut. And thought that it was stimulus-driven. And we don't believe our customers are telling us that the demand continued so aggressively actually to this moment that they believe that it was not stimulus-driven wholly, that it was driven by a consumer, at least in our Bedding and Home Furniture markets that is very much focused on the home. And it's interesting that if you look at historically, consumer spending on travel and entertainment, that's $1 trillion of spending that isn't finding a home right now. So that's cruise lines, airfare, movie theaters, things like that. So the consumer is very focused on their home. We believe that, that bodes really well for the future. But the question really that we can't answer is with the, let's call them challenges or some people would call it dysfunction in Washington. What happens with extraordinary unemployment? And does that start to slow demand? We haven't seen any of that. We think that, like I said, home focus is driving that consumption. But frankly, we just don't know. I mean there's -- that's part of why we don't give guidance. We're appreciative of every order that we take and the margins associated with that and the goodness that it provides for our employees from a safety of job, but the visibility into the future is really tough to forecast."

So I believe bedding, home furniture. Certainly, the housing statistics bode well for our Flooring business. The Hanes businesses in both Geo Components and on the Converting side, that it's highly correlated to home focus, some PPE manufacturing. So those businesses, we have every expectation will continue to do really well. There may be a little bit of a head fake for some of you in that. If you think of our Bedding segment, you might think of it as U.S. Spring, ECS in that bedding business where it's much broader. It has some industrial materials business, which is soft, and we expect that to continue to be soft. And I actually aired when I said U.S. Bedding, I do mean not only the Spring business but ECS. ECS is doing a terrific job and that business is growing at a faster rate than U.S. Spring, but -- so those are the positives.

Peter, I think you are right, I mean the -- our Aerospace business is likely to remain challenged as that industry sort of sorts through the many difficulties that are there. It's a relatively small part of our overall business, pretty nimble and fairly diverse actually across our customer base. So we'll hang in there and see what we can do to adjust in the face of that softer demand. And then I think, Work Furniture probably will see less of an extreme decline in demand but certainly, probably will lag returning to levels that we've seen in the prior years. Remember that we participate both from like task chair part of the industry, more traditional office but also a lot on the collaborative soft seating side. And so we'll see how that plays out as people adjust their work whether it's at home or how they work in the office, there may be some opportunities there. But in either case, where we are challenged there, we'll do our best to adjust our cost structure to the demand that we see."

And IHS is saying that we'll continue to see the recovery through Q3 and Q4 to roughly 90% of normal or 2019 levels, and we should see that recovery continue into 2021, being up about 13% over their forecast for 2020. So continued improvement in the market, but it's going to take several years to get back to the 2019 levels. 
The positive side for the business is the models that are in the highest demand are also the highest content vehicles. So that plays well for Leggett over the long haul. The industry trends in terms of sustainability, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, are all still in play, although some of that is being pushed out. And that continues to give us opportunities to play in the future, although the timing of some of that may have changed. So industry will continue to recover. We expect a pretty significant increase into 2021 if things hold up the way we are planning. And then longer term, our strategies, our product development seem to be right on target for customers."

First and foremost, I would like to thank our employees for their continued commitment to keeping each other safe and healthy while serving our customers. We are pleased to deliver strong third quarter results in these uncertain times, and this could not have happened without the dedication and hard work of our people. As we reported yesterday, third quarter earnings per share were a quarterly record of $0.77, this included $6 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic related cost reductions. Third quarter 2019 EPS was $0.74 and included $0.02 per share of restructuring related charges. Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.80, were up $0.04 from adjusted 2019 third quarter earnings. Third quarter EBIT was a quarterly record $147 million. EBIT increased in the quarter versus third quarter last year primarily due to lower fixed costs, partially offset by lower volume and a change in LIFO impact. EBIT margin increased 60 basis points to 12.2%, while adjusted EBIT margin increased 80 basis points to 12.7%, and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 16.6%. The third quarter sales were $1.208 billion, down 3% versus third quarter of 2019. The continued strong demand in residential end markets was more than offset by weaknesses in aerospace and work furniture. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $261 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to a notable 8.7% versus 10.7% in the third quarter of 2019. As we also reported yesterday, our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share fourth quarter dividend at an annual dividend of $1.60 per share. We have increased our annual dividend for 49 consecutive years. We remain committed to our position as a Dividend Aristocrat. At the end of October, we received positive news related to the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on mattress importers from 7 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed preliminary duties that range from 3% to 990%. Also in the quarter, the Department of Commerce imposed preliminary countervailing duties of 98% on China. We anticipate final determinations in these investigations in 2021, likely during second quarter. This should allow domestic mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. The company remains well positioned, both competitively and financially, to capitalize on long-term opportunities in various end markets. Our enduring long-term fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to continue to create value for our shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mitch."

As we discussed last quarter, our operational priorities for the third quarter included increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing",761,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As we discussed last quarter, our operational priorities for the third quarter included increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing supply chain issues associated with a global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications, responding to evolving government restrictions on production capacity in various parts of the world, and monitoring changes and demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. While challenges remain in most of these areas, we continue to make headway, and we'll provide more detail as we discuss each segment. 
Sales in our Bedding products segment were down 2% in the third quarter. Strong demand throughout the quarter in the Bedding market drove sales growth in ECS, U.S. Spring and European Spring. This growth was more than offset by lower volume in adjustable bed and exited volume in fashion bed and drawn wire. We continue to increase production while managing supply challenges with nonwoven fabrics and labor shortages. We found some alternative nonwoven fabrics, but they are less efficient in constrained production at our higher cost. We also incurred significant additional cost to airfreight nonwoven materials in an effort to better meet demand. In our U.S. Spring business, staffing is above pre-COVID levels, and we continue adding employees in response to strong demand. During the quarter, we also began to face supply constraints on TDI, the chemical used in the production of Foam. Producers of TDI declared force majeure and significantly reduced supply of the chemical. While the supply constraints have relaxed to a degree, we expect to see reduced supply through at least the end of the year. Within the last month, we have also seen shortages of polyols and MDI, chemical more widely used in our specialty foams. Producers have pointed to equipment outages and hurricanes in the Gulf as well as raw material availability as impediments to production. We anticipate a tight supply of these chemicals through mid-2021. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports, especially on the West Coast of the U.S. We are working diligently to address these issues and increase production so that we can better meet growing levels of market demand. Sales in our Specialized Products segment were down 9% in the third quarter, primarily from weak demand in aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders. We expect demand in aerospace to be challenged over the next few years, given the disruption in air travel and resulting buildup of aircraft and supply chain inventories. In our Automotive business, sales for the quarter were roughly flat as demand trends continue to improve throughout the quarter. We are currently operating at near pre-COVID capacity levels in all regions. Sales in our furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment were up 1% in the third quarter, driven by continued strong demand in fabric converting, geo textile components and home furniture. Recovery in work furniture continues to lag the other businesses in the segment as the industry has been heavily impacted by the effects of the pandemic. In flooring products, residential sales held up well, but hospitality sales have been weak due to disruptions in the travel industry. Across our businesses, we continue to focus on controlling costs by keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels and maintaining as much fixed cost savings as practical. The fixed cost actions we took earlier in the year reduced our third quarter cost by approximately $30 million, and we expect full year fixed cost savings of nearly $100 million. In the last few weeks, COVID-19 infections again began to surge across much of North America and Europe, reinforcing that we remain in an uncertain economic environment. Our first priority is to keep our employees safe and healthy, and I'm pleased that the safety protocols our team has developed and implemented are working very well. We cannot control the impacts of broad-based community spread, however. We continue to closely monitor government orders and demand signals across our markets and stand ready to rapidly respond to control costs and optimize cash flow should economic conditions decline. For now, we'll continue to do all that we can to bridge supply and demand gaps, particularly in our bedding business. 
I want to thank our employees for their dedication, ingenuity and resilience. Your actions are the key to our success and your efforts to overcome the many challenges that have developed this year are greatly appreciated. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the third quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. As previously mentioned, cash from operations was a record $261 million in the third quarter, an increase of $48 million versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to working capital improvements. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 8.7%, and outstanding results, reflecting our continued priority on closely controlling all elements of working capital. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with total liquidity of $1.4 billion, comprised of $245 million in cash on hand and $1.2 billion in available capacity under the $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. In the quarter, we reduced debt by $173 million, including a $60 million prepayment of a portion of our term loan A. As of September 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.74x, and an improvement over second quarter 3.1x. As it relates to the tax rate, the company benefited from new tax guidance issued in the third quarter related to global intangible low tax income, commonly referred to as GILTI, GILTI, which lowered our adjusted tax rate to approximately 18%. These newly-issued regulations reduce the amount of tax in certain situations where companies are paying high rates of foreign tax. The changes were retroactively applied to the beginning of 2018 when the GILTI rules were first put in place. From a uses of cash perspective, we continue to deploy our cash in a balanced and disciplined manner. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $70 million for the year, dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. Our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year are approximately $12 million, and we continue to limit our acquisition activity. In summary, we are committed to maintaining our long-held financial strength and investment-grade debt ratings. This discipline, along with the hard work and dedication of all of our employees allows us to withstand these uncertain times and capture long-term opportunities.

So there's a number of factors that are at play really the primary issue is the lack of nonwoven material availability as it been redirected to medical PPE applications. We went from having a handful of sort of top-tier nonwoven suppliers in the U.S. to completely redo our supply chain to have to find alternative types of material that we can run. As I mentioned, those types of that material is typically less efficient and will have to slow down our machines to run it. So it does constrain our supply. But we've added -- gone from 4 or 5 suppliers to a pretty large number across the globe. We mentioned that we airfreighted product to get it here to help beat demand. So we really are doing everything that we can to try and overcome those hurdles. But it remains a challenge and will continue to be a challenge as long as the primary spunbond nonwoven product that we really like to use is redirected. In addition, we are doing all we can to add more labor. I mentioned that we're ahead of our pre-COVID staffing levels. We continue to do -- to ramp up our staffing in an effort to get to 4 shifts in all our major facilities. They run 24/7, but it is a challenge to find that labor, but we are making headway. The chemical shortages, there's been force mature declared on TDI, MDI and Polyol, all fairly recently. We basically continue to search and bring in all the chemical that we can find, but there's simply not a lot of availability out there. The teams work on formulations and doing all that they can to conserve them. We're also adding additional equipment to produce our comfort core products. We expect that to start coming in early next year. And continue to -- we expect to be able to continue to increase our production, but there's no sort of magic on that gives us an overnight tremendous impact."

So a couple of things, too, from a finished goods inventory standpoint that at the end of September, we are well less than half of what our finished goods inventory would have been in January or March. So we're basically shipping what we're producing at this point. So that obviously impacts sales from a sort of year-over-year and a normal year perspective. You are right that even as we ramped up our headcount from taking it really down deep during the March and April time frame, and continue to make gains there. The quarter was also the worst impact for us on the availability of Nonwovens, as we had sort of last-minute what we thought supply that we could count on diverted from us. And so that absolutely did impact our production. We are still in difficult times, but getting a little bit more inventory that is having less impact on our production from a nonwoven standpoint from just an availability but still less efficient as we're having to run needle punch in that have spunbond in many areas. So from a sequential standpoint, we still continued to make gains throughout the quarter. But when we look year-over-year, particularly in September, we were down a bit."

In 2021, based on today's cost structure and the ability to -- our belief of our ability to maintain that cost efficiency going for forward. Will you, as a result, be more profitable?

So the comp was -- exceeded significantly. Home furniture demand subsequent to those first 3 weeks of the quarter continue to be strong. Our customers have been somewhat impacted by labor availability issues. So have we, to a lesser degree, they have been impacted by the TDI issue that was most acute in September, that Mitch made reference to. So furniture demand is strong.

First, I have to say, we're really, really proud of the automotive team for the diligent efforts to keep our customers running, and they have done that. In auto, we've seen significant monthly growth from May through September. We expect that to peak and come off. So in the last 2 months of the year as the holidays impact back the calendar, we don't have real-time visibility into the OEM inventories. But we do know they're at very low levels in U.S. and China, and they're trying to rebuild them to normal levels. And that's particularly true for trucks and SUVs. So in North America, September inventory ended at about 2.6 million units, are only 49 days of supply, which is down significantly from the normal range. And in China, we've now seen 5 consecutive months of year-over-year sales growth, which is pulling on those inventories, and that's due to partially due to government incentives. And these will drive higher production into the first half of 2021, again, particularly in China and North America, where those sales have been strong. But eventually, the normalized sales levels will not support these production levels that we've seen in Q3 and Q4, where we will come back to a normalized production to sales ratio."

First and foremost, I would like to thank our employees for their continued commitment to keeping each other safe and healthy while serving our customers. 
We are pleased to deliver strong third quarter results in these uncertain times, and this could not have happened without the dedication and hard work of our people. 
As we've reported yesterday, third quarter earnings per share were a quarterly record of $0.77, this included $6 million of restructuring charges incurred primarily from pandemic related cost reductions. Third quarter 2019 EPS was $0.74 and included $0.02 per share of restructuring related charges. 
Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted earnings of $0.80, were up $0.04 from adjusted 2019 third quarter earnings. 
Third quarter EBIT was a quarterly record $147 million. EBIT increased in the quarter versus third quarter last year primarily due to lower fixed costs, partially offset by lower volume and a change in LIFO impact. 
EBIT margin increased 60 basis points to 12.2%, while adjusted EBIT margin increased 80 basis points to 12.7%, and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 16.6%. 
Third quarter sales were $1.208 billion, down 3% versus third quarter of 2019. Continued strong demand in residential end markets was more than offset by weaknesses in Aerospace and Work Furniture. 
Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $261 million. Adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales for the quarter improved to a notable 8.7% versus 10.7% in the third quarter of 2019. 
As we also reported yesterday, our Board of Directors declared a $0.40 per share fourth quarter dividend at an annual dividend of $1.60 per share. We have increased our annual dividend for 49 consecutive years. 
We remain committed to our position as a Dividend Aristocrat. At the end of October, we received positive news related to the U.S. mattress industry's antidumping petition on mattress importers from 7 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia. 
The Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that mattresses were being sold at prices that violate the U.S. trade laws and imposed preliminary duties that range from 3% to 990%. 
Also in the quarter, the Department of Commerce imposed preliminary countervailing duties of 98% on China. We anticipate final determinations in these investigations in 2021, likely during second quarter. 
This should allow domestic mattress producers to compete on a more level playing field. The company remains well positioned, both competitively and financially, to capitalize on long-term opportunities in various end markets. Our enduring long-term fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.  
I'll now turn the call over to Mitch."

As we discussed last quarter, our operational priorities for the third quarter included increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing",760,"Thank you, Karl, and good morning, everyone. As we discussed last quarter, our operational priorities for the third quarter included increasing production to meet strong bedding demand, tackling widespread labor shortages, especially in the U.S., managing supply chain issues associated with a global shortage of nonwoven fabrics stemming from a surge in demand for medical PPE applications, responding to evolving government restrictions on production capacity in various parts of the world, and monitoring changes and demand signals and responding rapidly to control cost and optimize cash flow. 
While challenges remain in most of these areas, we continue to make headway, and we'll provide more detail as we discuss each segment.  
Sales in our Bedding Products segment were down 2% in the third quarter. Strong demand throughout the quarter in the bedding market drove sales growth in ECS, U.S. Spring and European Spring. 
This growth was more than offset by lower volume in Adjustable Bed and exited volume in Fashion Bed and drawn wire. We continue to increase production while managing supply challenges with nonwoven fabrics and labor shortages. 
We found some alternative nonwoven fabrics, but they are less efficient in constrained production at a higher cost. We also incurred significant additional cost to airfreight nonwoven materials in an effort to better meet demand. 
In our U.S. Spring business, staffing is above pre-COVID levels, and we continue adding employees in response to strong demand. During the quarter, we also began to face supply constraints on TDI, the chemical used in the production of foam. 
Producers of TDI declared force majeure and significantly reduced supply of the chemical. While the supply constraints have relaxed to a degree, we expect to see reduced supply through at least the end of the year. 
Within the last month, we have also seen shortages of polyols and MDI, chemical more widely used in our specialty foams. 
Producers have pointed to equipment outages and hurricanes in the Gulf as well as raw material availability as impediments to production. 
We anticipate a tight supply of these chemicals through mid-2021. Our supply chains have also been hampered by congested ports, especially on the West Coast of the U.S. 
We are working diligently to address these issues and increase production so that we can better meet growing levels of market demand. Sales in our Specialized Products segment were down 9% in the third quarter, primarily from weak demand in Aerospace and Hydraulic Cylinders. 
We expect demand in Aerospace to be challenged over the next few years, given the disruption in air travel and resulting buildup of aircraft and supply chain inventories. 
In our Automotive business, sales for the quarter were roughly flat as demand trends continue to improve throughout the quarter. 
We are currently operating at near pre-COVID capacity levels in all regions. Sales in our Furniture, Flooring and Textile Products segment were up 1% in the third quarter, driven by continued strong demand in Fabric Converting, Geotextile components and Home Furniture. 
Recovery in Work Furniture continues to lag the other businesses in the segment as the industry has been heavily impacted by the effects of the pandemic. 
In Flooring products, residential sales held up well, but hospitality sales have been weak due to disruptions in the travel industry. 
Across our businesses, we continue to focus on controlling costs by keeping our variable cost structure aligned with current demand levels and maintaining as much fixed cost savings as practical. 
The fixed cost actions we took earlier in the year reduced our third quarter cost by approximately $30 million, and we expect full year fixed cost savings of nearly $100 million. In the last few weeks, COVID-19 infections again began to surge across much of North America and Europe, reinforcing that we remain in an uncertain economic environment. 
Our first priority is to keep our employees safe and healthy, and I'm pleased that the safety protocols our team has developed and implemented are working very well. 
We cannot control though impacts of broad-based community spread, however. We continue to closely monitor government orders and demand signals across our markets and stand ready to rapidly respond to control costs and optimize cash flow should economic conditions decline. 
For now, we'll continue to do all that we can to bridge supply and demand gaps, particularly in our bedding business.  
I want to thank our employees for their dedication, ingenuity and resilience. Your actions are the key to our success and your efforts to overcome the many challenges that have developed this year are greatly appreciated.  
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

Throughout the third quarter, our primary financial focus has been on maximizing liquidity, generating cash and disciplined uses of cash. 
As previously mentioned, cash from operations was a record $261 million in the third quarter, an increase of $48 million versus the same quarter last year, primarily due to working capital improvements. We ended the quarter with adjusted working capital as a percentage of annualized sales at 8.7%, an outstanding result, reflecting our continued priority on closely controlling all elements of working capital. 
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with total liquidity of $1.4 billion, comprised of $245 million in cash on hand and $1.2 billion in available capacity under the $1.2 billion revolving credit facility. 
In the quarter, we reduced debt by $173 million, including a $60 million prepayment of a portion of our term loan A. As of September 30, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 2.74x, an improvement over second quarter's 3.1x. 
As it relates to the tax rate, the company benefited from new tax guidance issued in the third quarter related to global intangible low-taxed income, commonly referred to as GILTI, GILTI, which lowered our adjusted tax rate to approximately 18%. These newly issued regulations reduce the amount of tax in certain situations where companies are paying high rates of foreign tax. 
The changes were retroactively applied to the beginning of 2018 when the GILTI rules were first put in place. From a use of cash perspective, we continue to deploy our cash in a balanced and disciplined manner. 
We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $70 million for the year, dividends should require approximately $210 million for the full year. 
Our scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year are approximately $12 million, and we continue to limit our acquisition activity. 
In summary, we are committed to maintaining our long-held financial strength and investment-grade debt ratings. This discipline, along with the hard work and dedication of all of our employees allows us to withstand these uncertain times and capture long-term opportunities.

Yes, we're doing a lot, to be honest with you. So there's a number of factors that are at play really. The primary issue is the lack of nonwoven material availability as it's been redirected to medical PPE applications. 
We went from having a handful of sort of top-tier nonwoven suppliers in the U.S. to completely redoing our supply chain to have to find alternative types of material that we can run.
As I mentioned, those types of that material is typically less efficient and have to slow down our machines to run it. So it does constrain our supply. But we've added -- gone from 4 or 5 suppliers to a pretty large number across the globe. 
We mentioned that we airfreighted product to get it here to help beat demand. So we really are doing everything that we can to try and overcome those hurdles. 
But it remains a challenge and will continue to be a challenge as long as the primary spunbond nonwoven product that we really like to use is redirected. 
In addition, we are doing all we can to add more labor. I mentioned that we're ahead of our pre-COVID staffing levels. We continue to do -- to ramp up our staffing in an effort to get to 4 shifts in all our major facilities. 
They run 24/7, but it is a challenge to find that labor, but we are making headway. The chemical shortages, there's been force majeure declared on TDI, MDI and polyol, all fairly recently. We basically continue to search and bring in all the chemical that we can find, but there's simply not a lot of availability out there. The teams work on formulations and doing all that they can to conserve them. 
We're also adding additional equipment to produce our Comfort Core products. 
We expect that to start coming in early next year. And continue to -- we expect to be able to continue to increase our production, but there's no sort of magic on that gives us an overnight tremendous impact."

So a couple of things, too, from a finished goods inventory standpoint that end of September, we are well less than half of what our finished goods inventory would have been in January or March. So we're basically shipping what we're producing at this point. 
So that obviously impacts sales from a sort of year-over-year and a normal year perspective. You are right that even as we ramped up our headcount from taking it really down deep during the March and April time frame, and continue to make gains there. 
The quarter was also the worst impact for us on the availability of nonwovens, as we had sort of last-minute, what we thought, supply that we could count on diverted from us. And so that absolutely did impact our production. 
We are still in difficult times, but getting a little bit more inventory that is having less impact on our production from a nonwoven standpoint from just an availability but still less efficient as we're having to run -- needle punch instead of spunbond in many areas. So from a sequential standpoint, we still continued to make gains throughout the quarter. But when we look year-over-year, particularly in September, we were down a bit."

And in China, we've now seen 5 consecutive months of year-over-year sales growth, which is pulling on those inventories, and that's due to partially due to government incentives.
