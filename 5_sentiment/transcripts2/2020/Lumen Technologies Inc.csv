On today's call, I'll provide a recap on our progress in 2019 and how we're thinking about 2020 and beyond. Neel will provide an overview of our financial results, and then we'll go into your questions. 
We made good progress in 2019, transforming and positioning our business for the future while also delivering on our near-term objectives and meeting the guidance targets we provided at the beginning of the year. As I look back over the past 2 years, since the close of the Level 3 transaction, simply put, we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. As you can see on Slide 4, in 2018 and 2019, we met or exceeded all of the outlook measures we provided. We delivered 2 consecutive years of growth in adjusted EBITDA and 2 years of expanding margins. We also exceeded our integration synergy targets in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the deleveraging and transformation cost savings targets we shared with you in 2019. We have significantly ramped our free cash flow from premerger levels. Last year, as we said we would, we grew Enterprise and IGAM revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019. We still have a lot of work ahead but I'm proud of the work our team has done, and we will remain focused and financially disciplined as we continue to drive our transformation. 
You've heard me say many times that our focus is on driving growth in both profitable revenue and free cash flow per share. Our strategy is fairly straightforward, and our 2019 capital investment program focused on 3 primary areas: Enhancing our product capabilities to meet the changing technology needs of our customers and the digital interactions they seek; increasing the size of our addressable market by continually expanding our fiber footprint; and improving our customer experience and reducing our cost to operate through simplification and automation. 
I'm pleased with the progress across all of these dimensions. As an example of expanding our addressable market, in 2019, we've built fiber to approximately 18,000 additional enterprise buildings, bringing our total count to around 170,000 fiber-fed on-net locations. We've prioritized fiber deployment for consumers over previous investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We now have enabled more than 2 million fiber households, a number we expect to continue to grow. And we're making it easier for our consumer customers to access these networks by standardizing our product set and enabling a digital environment. That digital environment allows customers to immediately initiate service using automated and seamless provisioning processes. In turn, this lowers our cost to operate and improves our customer experience. This type of transformation creates a virtuous cycle. We optimize our capabilities to reduce costs, which drives a better customer experience; and happy customers buy more and churn less. 
Beyond our capital investments, we continue to take steps to improve the profitability of CenturyLink's base business. We are slowly eliminating our linear video products and shut down initiatives to create a streaming video product. We continue to grow our enterprise customer base to identify and exit low margin contracts. We have deemphasized low margin CPE sales. We still sell CPE, but only in the context of larger network-centric and professional services deals. These moves, obviously, have a negative effect on revenue, but have a positive effect on free cash flow generation. We believe the majority of this low-quality revenue grooming is now behind us, but we remain disciplined with our focus on profitable revenue growth. 
We're also very active in improving low-margin off-net circuits onto our own fiber facilities. This is a long, slow process, though. 
From a pure cost perspective, we achieved $850 million in run rate integration synergies in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the $800 million to $1 billion in transformation efficiencies we announced in 2019. We will continue to streamline our operating model and believe we have significant opportunities to continue to transform CenturyLink in the future. 
I'd like to cover one last highlight from 2019 before I discuss 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on 3 priorities: Increased capital spending to drive growth in the business. As examples, the addition of the 18,000 new on-net buildings, I mentioned, brings more customers locations on-net and gives us a strategic advantage and a better customer experience. Investment in our Edge capabilities, coupled with our deep and extensive fiber network, places us at the forefront of the low latency, high transmission rate world of edge computing. Upgrading our global network with the largest deployment of ultra-low loss fiber positions us well to continue winning in the long-haul fiber market, especially with hyperscale customers. Expanding our consumer fiber footprint enables growth in our high-speed broadband offerings. And lastly, as I just discussed, we believe investing in the transformation of our ""cash platforms"" not only drives operating efficiencies but also improves our customer experience and support our revenue growth initiatives across all of our customer segments. 
Our second objective was to reduce leverage with a target of 2.75x to 3.25x over 3 years. We reduced debt in 2019 by a little more than $2 billion. In addition to leverage reduction, we're taking advantage of our improved balance sheet and strong capital markets to lower our cost of capital and reduce interest rate risk.  Neel will provide additional detail, but I'm very pleased with this work and believe it should drive improved equity value over time. 
Finally, we believe our dividend is a key part of our value proposition, and we returned more than $1 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2019. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And in 2020, you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business for growth and further reducing leverage. Our dividend policy is unchanged, giving us what we believe is a very manageable payout ratio in the 30s. 
Turning to 2020 on Slide 6, I'll discuss our 2020 priorities. You'll notice they look a lot like our 2019 priorities, which, by the way, is what discipline to a plan looks like. First, we want to continue to transform our operations to improve both the employee experience and the customer experience. Second, we want to continue to invest in growth through fiber deployment and enablement of fiber-related products and services, such as embedded security, dynamic connections, cloud application management and edge computing. Third, grow adjusted EBITDA through ongoing improvements in sales, operational efficiency and financial discipline; and fourth, continue to progress toward our 2.75 to 3.25 leverage target. Neel will cover the details of our financial outlook for 2020. 
As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect our revenue trajectory to continue to improve. While we do not expect these improvements to be linear, we do expect better performance over the course of the year, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue. As you know, we don't provide a forward-looking outlook for revenue, but we understand the importance of growing revenue, and we are very focused on that as a key objective. 
I'll briefly walk through commentary for each of our business groups. I'll start with IGAM. As a reminder, our International and Global Accounts Business encompasses our operations in LatAm, EMEA and APAC as well as our global accounts team, which serves a little more than 200 customers, customers, primarily based in North America that operate on a global scale. These 200 customers aren't necessarily our largest customers by revenue, but their needs match our global capabilities and they represent opportunities for growth. The IGAM business showed improvement in the second half of 2019, and we believe we can leverage our investments and market position to drive continuing improvement. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment, which includes both large and regional enterprises, generally for companies with more than 500 employees as well as our public sector group that includes all domestic, federal, state, local and research and education customers. In addition to our ubiquitous fiber network, I've long been a believer that operating locally is a key differentiator. Our local market strategy leverages about 25 teams of general managers, account managers, sales engineers and sales support that are locally positioned in key markets across the country. These local teams work directly with and know our customers and their markets. As many of our competitors have pulled back from a local model, we continue to lean into it, creating what we believe is a distinct advantage for CenturyLink. This locally focused, customer-centered model, together with our far-reaching fiber network and the ability and willingness to effectively deploy capital to meet our customers' communications challenges, are leading an increasing number of customers to select CenturyLink. For example, the Texas Rangers announced in 2017 that they were planning to build a new enclosed ballpark to be ready for the 2020 baseball season, a ballpark that would require a new technology design to meet the needs of the team and the fans. They were focused on creating a one-of-a-kind experience for everyone at their home baseball games and additional events they hold throughout the year. The Rangers selected CenturyLink to support their smart stadium vision based on our multiple product capabilities, including our smart venue offering, professional services and hybrid networking portfolio, all riding over CenturyLink's diverse fiber connectivity into the stadium. 
Looking specifically at the public sector portion of our Enterprise segment highlights what I see as one of the key benefits of the combination of CenturyLink and Level 3. While both companies had a share of the federal business, we are seeing that the combined networks, together with our hybrid networking and other capabilities, have made us more competitive and are enabling us to win more new business than either company was able to do on its own. And if I may brag a bit, I also believe we have the best federal team in the business. I'll give you a few points that illustrate our growing success. After being selected as the first telecommunications provider to be awarded the authority to operate under the new EIS program, CenturyLink was then awarded the very first contract under EIS to provide core network services for NASA. We also recently announced a significant win with the Department of the Interior with a task order worth up to $1.6 billion over an 11-year period, which is even more significant as the DOI business was previously provided by a competitor. We've also recently announced wins with the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense Education Activity Network and the Census Bureau. We are excited about these wins, and we will continue to pursue growth in the public sector space, although I do want to caution that government contracts generally take several years to ramp. Our success with the federal government demonstrates what a skilled sales and support organization can do with a world-class network and leading-edge products. As with the various government entities, we are bringing the same capabilities to our enterprise and IGAM customers. 
Turning to SMB. We continue to see mixed results from this segment as revenue pressures from legacy services is far more than offsetting growth from new services and our expandable addressable market. However, we believe we can ultimately grow this segment and are investing in the products and platforms that are aligned to the unique needs of these customers. Our aim is to bring these customers the power of our network, security and other related services by enabling platforms that support high volume, frictionless transactions and make it easier and more efficient for these customers to access our capabilities. You can expect to see us continue to invest in fiber to multi-tenant environment and focus on taking share where those investments are made. To complement this investment and the ongoing simplification of our SMB operating model, we are streamlining, while at the same time, enhancing our product portfolio to enable solutions tailored for the small and medium business market. This includes products like Unified Communications as a Service, embedded security and simplified LAN offerings, all that are seamlessly delivered and scalable based on the individual customers' needs.  As I said, we're not yet where we expect to be in the SMB segment, but I am optimistic about our ability to improve performance over time. 
Our outlook for the Wholesale segment is largely unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue to decline, primarily driven by ongoing industry consolidation and technology evolution. However, technology evolution also gives us opportunities, and we are working closely with our wholesale customers to support their 5G initiatives as our expanding fiber footprint is a natural match for their needs. 
Within the Consumer business, 2019 was somewhat of a transitional year that highlighted 2 areas of focus: To focus on fiber as the premier last-mile access solution outside of our CAF II market; and the ramp down in our linear TV product. We believe our strategy to invest in fiber is paying off. Broadband revenue grew year-over-year each and every quarter in 2019. While we've seen declines in our low-speed broadband subscribers, we've seen great results with our high-speed subscribers. From the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we doubled the number of subscribers with speeds of 100 megabits or higher and nearly tripled the number of subscribers with 1 gig and higher. We believe the reason for this growth is the simple fact that fiber to the home, not hybrid fiber coax, not wireless, not even 5G, but fiber delivers the best experience for customers and is the most scalable for future services. As we all know from our own personal experience, consistent, resilient, high bandwidth connections are essential to today's consumers. Plainly put, while fiber isn't a practical solution in all markets or all neighborhoods, we take share where we invest in fiber directly to the home. We will continue to invest in our Consumer business, centered around 3 primary initiatives: Extending our fiber footprint in areas that make economic sense and ensuring we grow where we invest; improving our systems, tools and capabilities to create a simpler digital experience for our customers and to drive efficiencies to maximize cash flow from the declining parts of the business; and completing the CAF II build out. In addition, we like the framework we've seen over the last few weeks with the RDO program and believe the FCC has done an excellent job in designing a program to enable access to underserved areas. We believe RDO is a natural fit with CenturyLink's network and the robust fiber network capillarity from our CAF II position. We will pursue participation in ARO where the economics make sense for us. 
While we remain an enterprise-centric company, we see clear value in what the Consumer business contributes to CenturyLink. By growing where we invest, driving efficiencies into our operating model and maximizing the contribution from the declining parts of consumer, we believe we can effectively manage EBITDA and cash flow contributions from this business. 
And I'd also like to update you on a couple of other consumer-related items. First, you may have seen several announcements at the end of 2019 of settlements with various attorneys general regarding the consumer billing practices lawsuits. As of last week, we've reached settlements with AGs in 5 states. In the fourth quarter, we took a $50 million charge for consumer-related AG and litigation matters. We continue to maintain our marketing and billing practices. We're properly disclosed and consistent with widely used industry practices, but we also saw the benefit of settling these cases to enable us to focus on continuing to improve the business. We still have some ongoing litigation related to the consumer business, but we've made significant steps towards putting these matters behind us. 
I'd also like to give you an update on our strategic review of the Consumer business. During our review, we had no preconceived notions or predetermined outcomes in mind. There were no sacred cows. Our goal was to scrutinize the business unit and determine how we could maximize shareholder value over the long term. To that end, we have engaged with parties that are interested in exploring the purchase of all or parts of the business. We also took a look at what we could do -- be doing better internally to drive additional value. In this aspect, we confirmed several things we already knew. First, we can continue to improve efficiency in the business. By simplifying our product offers and moving to a more digital experience, we believe we can improve efficiency as legacy revenues decline. Second, we can more effectively penetrate our fiber-fed areas. We still have opportunities within our existing fiber footprint to drive higher penetration rates and are implementing new initiatives to do so. Third, that we should continue to expand our addressable market through further fiber deployment. We win where we invest in fiber-fed neighborhoods. Fiber is a superior solution, and we have demonstrated the ability to take share where we invest. As I mentioned, we are focusing on fiber as our preferred access solution in the consumer broadband market. We remain open to all value-enhancing opportunities and continue to engage with parties interested in transactions or partnership opportunities as we always would. But our focus right now is to continue to expand our fiber footprint, improve the operating model and extract costs from the business, which creates the best long-term value for the company and for our shareholders under any scenario. 
I will tell you that the team here sees the value in our network, platforms, products and our approach to customers, and we are excited about 2020. We hear from our customers that our willingness to invest, our differentiated service experience and our solutions capabilities make a difference in their ability to achieve their goals for 2020 and beyond. We continue to invest in our fiber network to drive greater revenue from our existing fiber infrastructure and invest in simplification and automation of our business, both to take out costs and to improve the customer experience. As we execute on that strategy, we believe we will drive sustainable long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and the outlook for 2020. Neel?"

We m",1398,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We met all our financial outlook metrics, specifically, adjusted EBITDA of $9.070 billion and free cash flow of $3.276 billion. For the full year 2019, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin to 40.5% compared to 38.6% for full year 2018, which represents a more than 500 basis point improvement since the Level 3 transaction. Over the course of 2019, through a series of capital market transactions, we reduced net debt by approximately $2 billion, delevering to 3.7x this quarter from 4x for the same period last year and 4.3x at the close of the Level 3 transaction. Over the last 12 months, we have also refinanced approximately $17 billion in long-term debt, reducing interest expense and extending maturities. And for the full year 2019, we achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. 
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2019, total revenue declined 4.4% to $22.4 billion. If you look at the year-over-year revenue decline for 2019, we estimate that about 25% to 30% of that decline was driven by actions we took to focus on profitable revenue in the failed sales leaseback accounting change that we described on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.6% to $5.57 billion. This compares to declines of 3.6% in the third quarter, 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we highlighted that we had about $40 million in nonrecurring revenue benefit. USF is up about the same amount this year compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. So as you look at the year-over-year percentage change, it is representative of the underlying business. Sequentially, total revenue decreased 0.6% compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter and a decline of 1.2% in the second quarter. Also keep -- please keep in mind, the fourth quarter is typically stronger from a seasonality perspective, while the first quarter is when we usually see contract rerates, primarily for our largest customers. We also expect a decrease in USF rates by approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the rates in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, this is passthrough revenue we collect for the FCC. 
Moving now to our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, IGAM declined 1.1%. On a sequential basis, IGAM grew 0.6% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, Enterprise revenue was roughly flat. We achieved our objective of improving the revenue trajectory for IGAM and Enterprise. Currency was a headwind, but adjusting for currency, which primarily impacts IGAM and excluding USF, both IGAM and Enterprise grew revenue for the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
SMB revenue decreased 3.3% year-over-year. This compares to our third quarter 2019 year-over-year decline of 6.5%. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.4% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 7.4% year-over-year. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 3% compared to an increase of 0.7% last quarter. As a reminder, we had a benefit of $15 million from a carrier settlement in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding that carrier settlement, wholesale would have declined 1.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Consumer on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue declined 5.5% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.9%, which compares to declines of 1.3% in the third quarter, 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 grew 2.1% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 2.3% last quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 53,000 subs. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $2.278 billion compared to $2.301 billion from the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $9.070 billion, which compares to $9.040 billion for 2018. Despite more than $1 billion in revenue loss year-over-year, we achieved our objective of growing full year adjusted EBITDA, focusing on profitable revenue and our cost transformation efforts. For the fourth quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $940 million. For 2019, capital expenditures were $3.628 billion. We ramped up our CapEx spend by more than $450 million relative to 2018 as we focused on improving revenue trajectory. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $1.022 billion. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of $3.276 billion. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 11. On our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we outlined a 3-year plan to get to a target range of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Over the course of 2019, we have been very active in the capital markets. And through a series of transactions, we decreased net debt by approximately $2 billion. Additionally, since announcing our deleveraging plan last February, we have refinanced $17 billion or roughly half our debt. Our improved credit profile and constructive market conditions have enabled us to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. 
Turning to our maturity profile on Slide 12. At the end of 2018, for the 5-year period from 2020 through 2025, we had approximately $26 billion of debt maturing. As a result of our deleveraging and refinancing activities, we have reduced maturities by over $12 billion for the same period. For the full year 2020, we expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of this range implies net cash interest expense savings of more than $200 million compared to 2019 and more than $350 million compared to 2018. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.7x, and we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. As the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. These savings are part of our 3-year transformation plan that we outlined last year. Overall, we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the fourth quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $173 million and free cash flow by $33 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 and our outlook for the full year 2020. Please note all outlook measures exclude integration and transformation expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.2 billion and free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. The slight increase in our outlook relative to last year is primarily driven by increased fiber deployments for our enterprise, federal and consumer customers. In terms of notable items on working capital, we expect cash payments for other post-employment benefits, or OPEB, of approximately $200 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses. Also important to note, our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions to the pension fund. For 2020, we do not have any required contributions. 
In summary, we concluded 2019 with strong execution on several fronts. We improved the revenue trajectory for the overall business. We delivered on EBITDA growth and margin expansion as we successfully balanced, investing in our growth products, investing in customer experience and appropriately harvesting our declining products. In addition to interest expense savings, our deleveraging activities and capital market transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With our continued investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth and ongoing cost transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2020. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to Jeff."

And -- which is largely our OPEB cash spend, which is in addition to what kind of flows through EBITDA. So that's the $200 million use of working capital. 
And if you think about our trade working capital, DSOs and DPOs, just a day difference there could swing working capital by $100 million or so. And then there is capital, in general. So it's not perfect, but that's kind of the rough math in terms of the working capital -- overall free cash flow range. 
And not in terms of ARPU, I think, in general, as we are moving customers up from a bandwidth standpoint, especially into gig services, the ARPU is significantly higher.

So let me talk about why I think we win, and I got a list of things that go into it, it's not one thing that causes us to win. But it starts with -- we have what I believe is the world's best fiber network. We're increasing our connectivity in the on-net locations every single day. We are connected with every cloud provider across the U.S., but really across the world. And we have great connectivity into them. We're creating solutions that allow our customers to manage their infrastructure more efficiently, things like dynamic connections, where they can scale bandwidth up and down, redirect it from 1 provider to another, from 1 cloud provider to another cloud provider if they want. Things like cloud application management, where they can look a layer higher and look at their cloud applications and how are they running. And so I think it starts with the connectivity, the fiber base, the high speed, the low-latency connectivity, coupled with embedded security to make it a reliable and safe environment for them, coupled with our network-related services to make it easier for our customers to manage, coupled with a great team. And I talked about our federal team and how great I think they are. But we also have great enterprise and GAM teams in small and medium business teams. We have a great team going out and driving the success. So I think that our success, over time, in the short term and in the long term, comes down to our ability to leverage our network with great products and make sure that we're positioning them and from our customers properly through great sales, and we're executing on delivering them great operations group.

And so we look at how do we leverage all of those capabilities. So for us, I think that, yes, we have parts of our business that are timing. But we face the truth on those. We recognize them for what they are. We manage them for contribution while we have them, and we lean into the growth of the things that we think will grow, like Edge compute, like the other cloud capabilities that I've talked about, like pure bandwidth and transmission rates that are going to continue to go up.

Thank you very much, Mike. Appreciate the question. 
Before we end today's call, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts based on our progress in 2019 and the outlook for 2020. 
We are executing well on the capital allocation plan we announced last year. We are investing more in the business to drive growth and positioning our fiber network as the platform for delivering the solutions our customers need. We made excellent progress on our objective to reduce leverage, extend maturities and lower interest expense. And as you saw, our interest expense for 2020 is more than $300 million lower than we paid in 2018, and we still returned over $1 billion in the form of a dividend to our shareholders in 2019. 
For our IGAM and Enterprise business units, we met our objective for growth in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019, and we're optimistic about 2020. We had a solid start in our first year with our transformation initiatives, which not only improve the customer experience and increase efficiency throughout the organization, they reduce our cost to operate the business. We delivered $430 million in annualized run rate savings as of the end of 2019. We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network, and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on extending our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network to all of our customers. All of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned with our overall guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share.

On today's call, I'll provide a recap on our progress in 2019 and how we're thinking about 2020 and beyond. Neel will provide an overview of our financial results, and then we'll go into your questions. 
We made good progress in 2019, transforming and positioning our business for the future while also delivering on our near-term objectives and meeting the guidance targets we provided at the beginning of the year. As I look back over the past 2 years, since the close of the Level 3 transaction, simply put, we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. 
As you can see on Slide 4, in 2018 and 2019, we met or exceeded all of the outlook measures we provided. We delivered 2 consecutive years of growth in adjusted EBITDA and 2 years of expanding margins. We also exceeded our integration synergy targets in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the deleveraging and transformation cost savings targets we shared with you in 2019. We have significantly ramped our free cash flow from premerger levels. Last year, as we said we would, we grew Enterprise and IGAM revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019. We still have a lot of work ahead, but I'm proud of the work our team has done, and we will remain focused and financially disciplined as we continue to drive our transformation. 
You've heard me say many times that our focus is on driving growth in both profitable revenue and free cash flow per share. Our strategy is fairly straightforward, and our 2019 capital investment program focused on 3 primary areas: Enhancing our product capabilities to meet the changing technology needs of our customers and the digital interactions they seek; increasing the size of our addressable market by continually expanding our fiber footprint; and improving our customer experience and reducing our cost to operate through simplification and automation. 
I'm pleased with the progress across all of these dimensions. As an example of expanding our addressable market in 2019, we built fiber to approximately 18,000 additional enterprise buildings, bringing our total count to around 170,000 fiber-fed on-net locations. We've prioritized fiber deployment for consumers over previous investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We now have enabled more than 2 million fiber households, a number we expect to continue to grow. And we're making it easier for our consumer customers to access these networks by standardizing our product set and enabling a digital environment. That digital environment allows customers to immediately initiate service using automated and seamless provisioning processes. In turn, this lowers our cost to operate and improves our customer experience. This type of transformation creates a virtuous cycle. We optimize our capabilities to reduce costs, which drives a better customer experience; and happy customers buy more and churn less. 
Beyond our capital investments, we continue to take steps to improve the profitability of CenturyLink's base business. We are slowly eliminating our linear video products and shut down initiatives to create a streaming video product. We continue to groom our enterprise customer base to identify and exit low margin contracts. We have deemphasized low margin CPE sales. We still sell CPE, but only in the context of larger network-centric and professional services deals. These moves, obviously, have a negative effect on revenue, but have a positive effect on free cash flow generation. We believe the majority of this low-quality revenue grooming is now behind us, but we remain disciplined with our focus on profitable revenue growth. 
We're also very active in grooming low-margin off-net circuits onto our own fiber facilities. This is a long, slow process, though. 
From a pure cost perspective, we achieved $850 million in run rate integration synergies in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the $800 million to $1 billion in transformation efficiencies we announced in 2019. We will continue to streamline our operating model and believe we have significant opportunities to continue to transform CenturyLink in the future. I'd like to cover one last highlight from 2019 before I discuss 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on 3 priorities: Increased capital spending to drive growth in the business. As examples, the addition of the 18,000 new on-net buildings, I mentioned, brings more customers locations on-net and gives us a strategic advantage and a better customer experience. Investment in our edge capabilities, coupled with our deep and extensive fiber network, places us at the forefront of the low latency, high transmission rate world of edge computing. Upgrading our global network with the largest deployment of ultra-low-loss fiber positions us well to continue winning in the long-haul fiber market, especially with hyperscale customers. Expanding our consumer fiber footprint enables growth in our high-speed broadband offerings. And lastly, as I just discussed, we believe investing in the transformation of our ""cash platforms"" not only drives operating efficiencies but also improves our customer experience and support our revenue growth initiatives across all of our customer segments. 
Our second objective was to reduce leverage with a target of 2.75x to 3.25x over 3 years. We reduced debt in 2019 by a little more than $2 billion. In addition to leverage reduction, we're taking advantage of our improved balance sheet and strong capital markets to lower our cost of capital and reduce interest rate risk. Neel will provide additional detail, but I'm very pleased with this work and believe it should drive improved equity value over time. 
Finally, we believe our dividend is a key part of our value proposition, and we returned more than $1 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2019. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And in 2020, you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business for growth and further reducing leverage. Our dividend policy is unchanged, giving us what we believe is a very manageable payout ratio in the 30s. 
Turning to 2020 on Slide 6, I'll discuss our 2020 priorities. You'll notice they look a lot like our 2019 priorities, which, by the way, is what discipline to a plan looks like. First, we want to continue to transform our operations to improve both the employee experience and the customer experience. Second, we want to continue to invest in growth through fiber deployment and enablement of fiber-related products and services, such as embedded security, dynamic connections, cloud application management and edge computing. Third, grow adjusted EBITDA through ongoing improvements in sales, operational efficiency and financial discipline; and fourth, continue to progress toward our 2.75x to 3.25x leverage target. Neel will cover the details of our financial outlook for 2020.
As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect our revenue trajectory to continue to improve. While we do not expect these improvements to be linear, we do expect better performance over the course of the year, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue. As you know, we don't provide a forward-looking outlook for revenue, but we understand the importance of growing revenue, and we are very focused on that as a key objective. 
I'll briefly walk through commentary for each of our business groups. I'll start with IGAM. As a reminder, our International and Global Accounts Business encompasses our operations in LatAm, EMEA and APAC as well as our global accounts team, which serves a little more than 200 customers, customers, primarily based in North America that operate on a global scale. These 200 customers aren't necessarily our largest customers by revenue, but their needs match our global capabilities and they represent opportunities for growth. The IGAM business showed improvement in the second half of 2019, and we believe we can leverage our investments and market position to drive continuing improvement. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment, which includes both large and regional enterprises, generally for companies with more than 500 employees as well as our public sector group that includes all domestic, federal, state, local and research and education customers. In addition to our ubiquitous fiber network, I've long been a believer that operating locally is a key differentiator. Our local market strategy leverages about 25 teams of general managers, account managers, sales engineers and sales support that are locally positioned in key markets across the country. These local teams work directly with and know our customers and their markets. 
As many of our competitors have pulled back from a local model, we have continued to lean into it, creating what we believe is a distinct advantage for CenturyLink. This locally focused, customer-centered model, together with our far-reaching fiber network and the ability and willingness to effectively deploy capital to meet our customers' communications challenges, are leading an increasing number of customers to select CenturyLink. For example, the Texas Rangers announced in 2017 that they were planning to build a new enclosed ballpark to be ready for the 2020 baseball season, a ballpark that would require a new technology design to meet the needs of the team and the fans. They were focused on creating a one-of-a-kind experience for everyone at their home baseball games and additional events they hold throughout the year. The Rangers selected CenturyLink to support their smart stadium vision based on our multiple product capabilities, including our smart venue offering, professional services and hybrid networking portfolio, all riding over CenturyLink's diverse fiber connectivity into the stadium. 
Looking specifically at the public sector portion of our Enterprise segment highlights what I see as one of the key benefits of the combination of CenturyLink and Level 3. While both companies had a share of the federal business, we are seeing that the combined networks, together with our hybrid networking and other capabilities, have made us more competitive and are enabling us to win more new business than either company was able to do on its own. And if I may brag a bit, I also believe we have the best federal team in the business. 
I'll give you a few points that illustrate our growing success. After being selected as the first telecommunications provider to be awarded the authority to operate under the new EIS program, CenturyLink was then awarded the very first contract under EIS to provide core network services for NASA. We also recently announced a significant win with the Department of the Interior with a task order worth up to $1.6 billion over an 11-year period, which is even more significant as the DOI business was previously provided by a competitor. We've also recently announced wins with the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense Education Activity Network and the Census Bureau. We are excited about these wins, and we will continue to pursue growth in the public sector space, although I do want to caution that government contracts generally take several years to ramp. Our success with the federal government demonstrates what a skilled sales and support organization can do with a world-class network and leading-edge products. As with the various government entities, we are bringing these same capabilities to our enterprise and IGAM customers. 
Turning to SMB. We continue to see mixed results from this segment as revenue pressures from legacy services is far more than offsetting growth from new services and our expandable addressable market. However, we believe we can ultimately grow this segment and are investing in the products and platforms that are aligned to the unique needs of these customers. Our aim is to bring these customers the power of our network, security and other related services by enabling platforms that support high volume, frictionless transactions and make it easier and more efficient for these customers to access our capabilities. You can expect to see us continue to invest in fiber to multi-tenant environment and focus on taking share where those investments are made. To complement this investment and the ongoing simplification of our SMB operating model, we are streamlining, while at the same time, enhancing our product portfolio to enable solutions tailored for the small and medium business market. This includes products like Unified Communications as a Service, embedded security and simplified LAN offerings, all that are seamlessly delivered and scalable based on the individual customers' needs. As I said, we're not yet where we expect to be in the SMB segment, but I am optimistic about our ability to improve performance over time. 
Our outlook for the Wholesale segment is largely unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue to decline, primarily driven by ongoing industry consolidation and technology evolution. However, technology evolution also gives us opportunities, and we are working closely with our wholesale customers to support their 5G initiatives as our expanding fiber footprint is a natural match for their needs. 
Within the Consumer business, 2019 was somewhat of a transitional year that highlighted 2 areas of focus: to focus on fiber as the premier last-mile access solution outside of our CAF II market; and the ramp down in our linear TV product. We believe our strategy to invest in fiber is paying off. Broadband revenue grew year-over-year each and every quarter in 2019. While we've seen declines in our low-speed broadband subscribers, we've seen great results with our high-speed subscribers. 
From the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we doubled the number of subscribers with speeds of 100 megabits or higher and nearly tripled the number of subscribers with 1 gig and higher. We believe the reason for this growth is the simple fact that fiber to the home, not hybrid fiber coax, not wireless, not even 5G, but fiber delivers the best experience for customers and is the most scalable for future services. As we all know from our own personal experience, consistent, resilient, high bandwidth connections are essential to today's consumers. 
Plainly put, while fiber isn't a practical solution in all markets or all neighborhoods, we take share where we invest in fiber directly to the home. We will continue to invest in our Consumer business, centered around 3 primary initiatives: Extending our fiber footprint in areas that make economic sense and ensuring we grow where we invest; improving our systems, tools and capabilities to create a simpler digital experience for our customers and to drive efficiencies to maximize cash flow from the declining parts of the business; and completing the CAF II build out. In addition, we like the framework we've seen over the last few weeks with the RDOF program and believe the FCC has done an excellent job in designing a program to enable access to underserved areas. We believe RDOF is a natural fit with CenturyLink's network and the robust fiber network capillarity from our CAF II position. We will pursue participation in RDOF where the economics make sense for us. 
While we remain an enterprise-centric company, we see clear value in what the Consumer business contributes to CenturyLink. By growing where we invest, driving efficiencies into our operating model and maximizing the contribution from the declining parts of consumer, we believe we can effectively manage EBITDA and cash flow contributions from this business. 
And I'd also like to update you on a couple of other consumer-related items. First, you may have seen several announcements at the end of 2019 of settlements with various attorneys general regarding the consumer billing practices lawsuits. As of last week, we've reached settlements with AGs in 5 states. In the fourth quarter, we took a $50 million charge for consumer-related AG and litigation matters. We continue to maintain our marketing and billing practices. We're properly disclosed and consistent with widely used industry practices, but we also saw the benefit of settling these cases to enable us to focus on continuing to improve the business. We still have some ongoing litigation related to the consumer business, but we've made significant steps towards putting these matters behind us. 
I'd also like to give you an update on our strategic review of the Consumer business. During our review, we had no preconceived notions or predetermined outcomes in mind. There were no sacred cows. Our goal was to scrutinize the business unit and determine how we could maximize shareholder value over the long term. To that end, we have engaged with parties that are interested in exploring the purchase of all or parts of the business. We also took a look at what we could do -- be doing better internally to drive additional value. In this aspect, we confirmed several things we already knew. First, we can continue to improve efficiency in the business. By simplifying our product offers and moving to a more digital experience, we believe we can improve efficiency as legacy revenues decline. 
Second, we can more effectively penetrate our fiber-fed areas. We still have opportunities within our existing fiber footprint to drive higher penetration rates and are implementing new initiatives to do so. Third, that we should continue to expand our addressable market through further fiber deployment. We win where we invest in fiber-fed neighborhoods. Fiber is a superior solution, and we have demonstrated the ability to take share where we invest. As I mentioned, we are focusing on fiber as our preferred access solution in the consumer broadband market. We remain open to all value-enhancing opportunities and continue to engage with parties interested in transactions or partnership opportunities as we always would. But our focus right now is to continue to expand our fiber footprint, improve the operating model and extract costs from the business, which creates the best long-term value for the company and for our shareholders under any scenario. 
I will tell you that the team here sees the value in our network, platforms, products and our approach to customers, and we are excited about 2020. We hear from our customers that our willingness to invest, our differentiated service experience and our solutions capabilities make a difference in their ability to achieve their goals for 2020 and beyond. We continue to invest in our fiber network to drive greater revenue from our existing fiber infrastructure and invest in simplification and automation of our business, both to take out costs and to improve the customer experience. As we execute on that strategy, we believe we will drive sustainable long-term growth in free cash flow per share.

Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We",1396,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 
2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We met all our financial outlook metrics, specifically, adjusted EBITDA of $9.070 billion and free cash flow of $3.276 billion. For the full year 2019, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin to 40.5% compared to 38.6% for full year 2018, which represents a more than 500 basis point improvement since the Level 3 transaction. Over the course of 2019, through a series of capital market transactions, we reduced net debt by approximately $2 billion, delevering to 3.7x this quarter from 4x for the same period last year and 4.3x at the close of the Level 3 transaction. Over the last 12 months, we have also refinanced approximately $17 billion in long-term debt, reducing interest expense and extending maturities. And for the full year 2019, we achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. 
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2019, total revenue declined 4.4% to $22.4 billion. If you look at the year-over-year revenue decline for 2019, we estimate that about 25% to 30% of that decline was driven by actions we took to focus on profitable revenue in the failed sales leaseback accounting change that we described on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.6% to $5.57 billion. This compares to declines of 3.6% in the third quarter, 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we highlighted that we had about $40 million in nonrecurring revenue benefit. USF is up about the same amount this year compared to the fourth quarter 2018. So as you look at the year-over-year percentage change, it is representative of the underlying business. Sequentially, total revenue decreased 0.6% compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter and a decline of 1.2% in the second quarter. Also keep -- please keep in mind, the fourth quarter is typically stronger from a seasonality perspective, with the first quarter is when we usually see contract rerates, primarily for our largest customers. We also expect a decrease in USF rates by approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the rates in the fourth quarter 2019. As a reminder, this is passthrough revenue we collect for the FCC. 
Moving now to our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, IGAM declined 1.1%. On a sequential basis, IGAM grew 0.6% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, Enterprise revenue was roughly flat. We achieved our objective of improving the revenue trajectory for IGAM and Enterprise. Currency was a headwind, but adjusting for currency, which primarily impacts IGAM and excluding USF, both IGAM and Enterprise grew revenue for the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
SMB revenue decreased 3.3% year-over-year. This compares to a third quarter 2019 year-over-year decline of 6.5%. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.4% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 7.4% year-over-year. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 3% compared to an increase of 0.7% last quarter. As a reminder, we had a benefit of $15 million from a carrier settlement in the third quarter 2019. Excluding that carrier settlement, wholesale would have declined 1.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Consumer on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.5% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.9%, which compares to declines of 1.3% in the third quarter, 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 grew 2.1% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 2.3% last quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 53,000 subs. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $2.278 billion compared to $2.301 billion from the year ago quarter. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $9.070 billion, which compares to $9.040 billion for 2018. Despite more than $1 billion in revenue loss year-over-year, we achieved our objective of growing full year adjusted EBITDA, focusing on profitable revenue and our cost transformation efforts. For the fourth quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $940 million. For 2019, capital expenditures were $3.628 billion. We ramped up our CapEx spend by more than $450 million relative to 2018 as we focused on improving revenue trajectory. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $1.022 billion. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of $3.276 billion. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 11. On our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we outlined a 3-year plan to get to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Over the course of 2019, we have been very active in the capital markets. And through a series of transactions, we decreased net debt by approximately $2 billion. Additionally, since announcing our deleveraging plan last February, we have refinanced $17 billion or roughly half our debt. Our improved credit profile and constructive market conditions have enabled us to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. 
Turning to our maturity profile on Slide 12. At the end of 2018, for the 5-year period from 2020 through 2025, we had approximately $26 billion of debt maturing. As a result of our deleveraging and refinancing activities, we have reduced maturities by over $12 billion for the same period. For the full year 2020, we expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of this range implies net cash interest expense savings of more than $200 million compared to 2019 and more than $350 million compared to 2018. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.7x, and we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. These savings are part of our 3-year transformation plan that we outlined last year. Overall, we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the fourth quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $173 million and free cash flow by $33 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 and our outlook for the full year 2020. Please note all outlook measures exclude integration and transformation expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.2 billion and free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. The slight increase in our outlook relative to last year is primarily driven by increased fiber deployments for our enterprise, federal and consumer customers. In terms of notable items on working capital, we expect cash payments for other post-employment benefits, or OPEB, of approximately $200 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses. Also important to note, our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions to the pension fund. For 2020, we do not have any required contributions. 
In summary, we concluded 2019 with strong execution on several fronts. We improved the revenue trajectory for the overall business. We delivered on EBITDA growth and margin expansion as we successfully balanced, investing in our growth products, investing in customer experience and appropriately harvesting our declining products. In addition to interest expense savings, our deleveraging activities and capital market transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With our continued investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth and ongoing cost transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2020. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to Jeff."

We're a key provider to them in both companies. There's always upside and downside. And their expansion into 5G and expansion into other markets represents an upside, but we'll have to just look at it over time.

And so we just look at it as an opportunity to define where we're the right solution for those providers."

We're going to be very milestone-based. We have good line of sight and that's all factored into our EBITDA guidance range.

So whether it's a look at a particular state or look at all of the consumer business or some sort of joint venture, I mean, we're open to all of those various things."

I think it's capital and working capital. So if you start with EBITDA, less CapEx, net cash interest and our guidance for cash taxes and kind of do the math on implied working capital, it's roughly $200 million. And -- which is largely our OPEB cash spend, which is in addition to what kind of flows through EBITDA. So that's the $200 million use of working capital. 
And if you think about our trade working capital, DSOs and DPOs, just a day difference there could swing working capital by $100 million or so. And then there is capital, in general. So it's not perfect, but that's kind of the rough math in terms of the working capital -- the overall free cash flow range. 
And in terms of ARPU, I think, in general, as we are moving customers up from a bandwidth standpoint, especially into gig services, the ARPU is significantly higher. And so that is something that we are continuing to work on. And the churn rates are better. So that's going to be an ongoing effort for us."

Things like cloud application management, where they can look a layer higher and look at their cloud applications and how are they running.

Thank you very much, Mike. Appreciate the question. 
Before we end today's call, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts based on our progress in 2019 and the outlook for 2020. 
We are executing well on the capital allocation plan we announced last year. We are investing more in the business to drive growth and positioning our fiber network as the platform for delivering the solutions our customers need. We made excellent progress on our objective to reduce leverage, extend maturities and lower interest expense. And as you saw, our interest expense for 2020 is more than $300 million lower than we paid in 2018, and we still returned over $1 billion in the form of a dividend to our shareholders in 2019. 
For our IGAM and Enterprise business units, we met our objective for growth in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019, and we're optimistic about 2020. We had a solid start in our first year with our transformation initiatives, which not only improve the customer experience and increase efficiency throughout the organization, they reduce our cost to operate the business. We delivered $430 million in annualized run rate savings as of the end of 2019. We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network, and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on expanding our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network to all of our customers. All of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned with our overall guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share.

On today's call, I'll provide a recap on our progress in 2019 and how we're thinking about 2020 and beyond. Neel will provide an overview of our financial results, and then we'll go into your questions. 
We made good progress in 2019, transforming and positioning our business for the future while also delivering on our near-term objectives and meeting the guidance targets we provided at the beginning of the year. As I look back over the past 2 years, since the close of the Level 3 transaction, simply put, we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. 
As you can see on Slide 4, in 2018 and 2019, we met or exceeded all of the outlook measures we provided. We delivered 2 consecutive years of growth in adjusted EBITDA and 2 years of expanding margins. We also exceeded our integration synergy targets in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the deleveraging and transformation cost savings targets we shared with you in 2019. We have significantly ramped our free cash flow from premerger levels. Last year, as we said we would, we grew Enterprise and IGAM revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019. We still have a lot of work ahead, but I'm proud of the work our team has done, and we will remain focused and financially disciplined as we continue to drive our transformation. 
You've heard me say many times that our focus is on driving growth in both profitable revenue and free cash flow per share. Our strategy is fairly straightforward, and our 2019 capital investment program focused on 3 primary areas: Enhancing our product capabilities to meet the changing technology needs of our customers and the digital interactions they seek; increasing the size of our addressable market by continually expanding our fiber footprint; and improving our customer experience and reducing our cost to operate through simplification and automation. 
I'm pleased with the progress across all of these dimensions. As an example of expanding our addressable market in 2019, we built fiber to approximately 18,000 additional enterprise buildings, bringing our total count to around 170,000 fiber-fed on-net locations. We've prioritized fiber deployment for consumers over previous investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We now have enabled more than 2 million fiber households, a number we expect to continue to grow. And we're making it easier for our consumer customers to access these networks by standardizing our product set and enabling a digital environment. That digital environment allows customers to immediately initiate service using automated and seamless provisioning processes. In turn, this lowers our cost to operate and improves our customer experience. This type of transformation creates a virtuous cycle. We optimize our capabilities to reduce costs, which drives a better customer experience; and happy customers buy more and churn less. 
Beyond our capital investments, we continue to take steps to improve the profitability of CenturyLink's base business. We are slowly eliminating our linear video products and shut down initiatives to create a streaming video product. We continue to groom our enterprise customer base to identify and exit low margin contracts. We have deemphasized low margin CPE sales. We still sell CPE, but only in the context of larger network-centric and professional services deals. These moves, obviously, have a negative effect on revenue, but have a positive effect on free cash flow generation. We believe the majority of this low-quality revenue grooming is now behind us, but we remain disciplined with our focus on profitable revenue growth. 
We're also very active in grooming low-margin off-net circuits onto our own fiber facilities. This is a long, slow process, though. From a pure cost perspective, we achieved $850 million in run rate integration synergies in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the $800 million to $1 billion in transformation efficiencies we announced in 2019. We will continue to streamline our operating model and believe we have significant opportunities to continue to transform CenturyLink in the future. I'd like to cover one last highlight from 2019 before I discuss 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on 3 priorities: Increased capital spending to drive growth in the business. As examples, the addition of the 18,000 new on-net buildings, I mentioned, brings more customers locations on-net and gives us a strategic advantage and a better customer experience. Investment in our edge capabilities, coupled with our deep and extensive fiber network, places us at the forefront of the low latency, high transmission rate world of edge computing. Upgrading our global network with the largest deployment of ultra-low-loss fiber positions us well to continue winning in the long-haul fiber market, especially with hyperscale customers. Expanding our consumer fiber footprint enables growth in our high-speed broadband offerings. And lastly, as I just discussed, we believe investing in the transformation of our ""cash platforms"" not only drives operating efficiencies but also improves our customer experience and support our revenue growth initiatives across all of our customer segments. 
Our second objective was to reduce leverage with a target of 2.75x to 3.25x over 3 years. We reduced debt in 2019 by a little more than $2 billion. In addition to leverage reduction, we're taking advantage of our improved balance sheet and strong capital markets to lower our cost of capital and reduce interest rate risk. Neel will provide additional detail, but I'm very pleased with this work and believe it should drive improved equity value over time. 
Finally, we believe our dividend is a key part of our value proposition, and we returned more than $1 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2019. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And in 2020, you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business for growth and further reducing leverage. Our dividend policy is unchanged, giving us what we believe is a very manageable payout ratio in the 30s. 
Turning to 2020 on Slide 6. I'll discuss our 2020 priorities. You'll notice they look a lot like our 2019 priorities, which, by the way, is what discipline to a plan looks like. First, we want to continue to transform our operations to improve both the employee experience and the customer experience. Second, we want to continue to invest in growth through fiber deployment and enablement of fiber-related products and services, such as embedded security, dynamic connections, cloud application management and edge computing. Third, grow adjusted EBITDA through ongoing improvements in sales, operational efficiency and financial discipline; and fourth, continue to progress toward our 2.75x to 3.25x leverage target. Neel will cover the details of our financial outlook for 2020.
As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect our revenue trajectory to continue to improve. While we do not expect these improvements to be linear, we do expect better performance over the course of the year, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue. As you know, we don't provide a forward-looking outlook for revenue, but we understand the importance of growing revenue, and we are very focused on that as a key objective. 
I'll briefly walk through commentary for each of our business groups. I'll start with IGAM. As a reminder, our International and Global Accounts Business encompasses our operations in LatAm, EMEA and APAC as well as our global accounts team, which serves a little more than 200 customers, customers, primarily based in North America that operate on a global scale. These 200 customers aren't necessarily our largest customers by revenue, but their needs match our global capabilities and they represent opportunities for growth. The IGAM business showed improvement in the second half of 2019, and we believe we can leverage our investments and market position to drive continuing improvement. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment, which includes both large and regional enterprises, generally for companies with more than 500 employees as well as our public sector group that includes all domestic, federal, state, local and research and education customers. In addition to our ubiquitous fiber network, I've long been a believer that operating locally is a key differentiator. Our local market strategy leverages about 25 teams of general managers, account managers, sales engineers and sales support that are locally positioned in key markets across the country. These local teams work directly with and know our customers and their markets. 
As many of our competitors have pulled back from a local model, we have continued to lean into it, creating what we believe is a distinct advantage for CenturyLink. This locally focused, customer-centered model, together with our far-reaching fiber network and the ability and willingness to effectively deploy capital to meet our customers' communications challenges, are leading an increasing number of customers to select CenturyLink. For example, the Texas Rangers announced in 2017 that they were planning to build a new enclosed ballpark to be ready for the 2020 baseball season, a ballpark that would require a new technology design to meet the needs of the team and the fans. They were focused on creating a one-of-a-kind experience for everyone at their home baseball games and additional events they hold throughout the year. The Rangers selected CenturyLink to support their smart stadium vision based on our multiple product capabilities, including our smart venue offering, professional services and hybrid networking portfolio, all riding over CenturyLink's diverse fiber connectivity into the stadium. 
Looking specifically at the public sector portion of our Enterprise segment highlights what I see as one of the key benefits of the combination of CenturyLink and Level 3. While both companies had a share of the federal business, we are seeing that the combined networks, together with our hybrid networking and other capabilities, have made us more competitive and are enabling us to win more new business than either company was able to do on its own. And if I may brag a bit, I also believe we have the best federal team in the business. 
I'll give you a few points that illustrate our growing success. After being selected as the first telecommunications provider to be awarded the authority to operate under the new EIS program, CenturyLink was then awarded the very first contract under EIS to provide core network services for NASA. We also recently announced a significant win with the Department of the Interior with a task order worth up to $1.6 billion over an 11-year period, which is even more significant as the DOI business was previously provided by a competitor. We've also recently announced wins with the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense Education Activity Network and the Census Bureau. We are excited about these wins, and we will continue to pursue growth in the public sector space, although I do want to caution that government contracts generally take several years to ramp. Our success with the federal government demonstrates what a skilled sales and support organization can do with a world-class network and leading-edge products. As with the various government entities, we are bringing these same capabilities to our enterprise and IGAM customers. 
Turning to SMB. We continue to see mixed results from this segment as revenue pressures from legacy services is far more than offsetting growth from new services and our expandable addressable market. However, we believe we can ultimately grow this segment and are investing in the products and platforms that are aligned to the unique needs of these customers. Our aim is to bring these customers the power of our network, security and other related services by enabling platforms that support high volume, frictionless transactions and make it easier and more efficient for these customers to access our capabilities. You can expect to see us continue to invest in fiber to multi-tenant environment and focus on taking share where those investments are made. To complement this investment and the ongoing simplification of our SMB operating model, we are streamlining, while at the same time, enhancing our product portfolio to enable solutions tailored for the small and medium business market. This includes products like Unified Communications as a Service, embedded security and simplified LAN offerings, all that are seamlessly delivered and scalable based on the individual customers' needs. As I said, we're not yet where we expect to be in the SMB segment, but I am optimistic about our ability to improve performance over time. 
Our outlook for the Wholesale segment is largely unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue to decline, primarily driven by ongoing industry consolidation and technology evolution. However, technology evolution also gives us opportunities, and we are working closely with our wholesale customers to support their 5G initiatives as our expanding fiber footprint is a natural match for their needs. 
Within the Consumer business, 2019 was somewhat of a transitional year that highlighted 2 areas of focus: to focus on fiber as the premier last-mile access solution outside of our CAF II market; and the ramp down in our linear TV product. We believe our strategy to invest in fiber is paying off. Broadband revenue grew year-over-year each and every quarter in 2019. While we've seen declines in our low-speed broadband subscribers, we've seen great results with our high-speed subscribers. 
From the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we doubled the number of subscribers with speeds of 100 megabits or higher and nearly tripled the number of subscribers with 1 gig and higher. We believe the reason for this growth is the simple fact that fiber to the home, not hybrid fiber coax, not wireless, not even 5G, but fiber delivers the best experience for customers and is the most scalable for future services. As we all know from our own personal experience, consistent, resilient, high bandwidth connections are essential to today's consumers. 
Plainly put, while fiber isn't a practical solution in all markets or all neighborhoods, we take share where we invest in fiber directly to the home. We will continue to invest in our Consumer business, centered around 3 primary initiatives: Extending our fiber footprint in areas that make economic sense and ensuring we grow where we invest; improving our systems, tools and capabilities to create a simpler digital experience for our customers and to drive efficiencies to maximize cash flow from the declining parts of the business; and completing the CAF II build out. In addition, we like the framework we've seen over the last few weeks with the RDOF program and believe the FCC has done an excellent job in designing a program to enable access to underserved areas. We believe RDOF is a natural fit with CenturyLink's network and the robust fiber network capillarity from our CAF II position. We will pursue participation in RDOF where the economics make sense for us. 
While we remain an enterprise-centric company, we see clear value in what the Consumer business contributes to CenturyLink. By growing where we invest, driving efficiencies into our operating model and maximizing the contribution from the declining parts of consumer, we believe we can effectively manage EBITDA and cash flow contributions from this business. 
And I'd also like to update you on a couple of other consumer-related items. First, you may have seen several announcements at the end of 2019 of settlements with various attorneys general regarding the consumer billing practices lawsuits. As of last week, we've reached settlements with AGs in 5 states. In the fourth quarter, we took a $50 million charge for consumer-related AG and litigation matters. We continue to maintain our marketing and billing practices. We're properly disclosed and consistent with widely used industry practices, but we also saw the benefit of settling these cases to enable us to focus on continuing to improve the business. We still have some ongoing litigation related to the consumer business, but we've made significant steps towards putting these matters behind us. 
I'd also like to give you an update on our strategic review of the Consumer business. During our review, we had no preconceived notions or predetermined outcomes in mind. There were no sacred cows. Our goal was to scrutinize the business unit and determine how we could maximize shareholder value over the long term. To that end, we have engaged with parties that are interested in exploring the purchase of all or parts of the business. We also took a look at what we could do -- be doing better internally to drive additional value. In this aspect, we confirmed several things we already knew. First, we can continue to improve efficiency in the business. By simplifying our product offers and moving to a more digital experience, we believe we can improve efficiency as legacy revenues decline. 
Second, we can more effectively penetrate our fiber-fed areas. We still have opportunities within our existing fiber footprint to drive higher penetration rates and are implementing new initiatives to do so. Third, that we should continue to expand our addressable market through further fiber deployment. We win where we invest in fiber-fed neighborhoods. Fiber is a superior solution, and we have demonstrated the ability to take share where we invest. As I mentioned, we are focusing on fiber as our preferred access solution in the consumer broadband market. We remain open to all value-enhancing opportunities and continue to engage with parties interested in transactions or partnership opportunities as we always would. But our focus right now is to continue to expand our fiber footprint, improve the operating model and extract costs from the business, which creates the best long-term value for the company and for our shareholders under any scenario. 
I will tell you that the team here sees the value in our network, platforms, products and our approach to customers, and we are excited about 2020. We hear from our customers that our willingness to invest, our differentiated service experience and our solutions capabilities make a difference in their ability to achieve their goals for 2020 and beyond. We continue to invest in our fiber network to drive greater revenue from our existing fiber infrastructure and invest in simplification and automation of our business, both to take out costs and to improve the customer experience. As we execute on that strategy, we believe we will drive sustainable long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and the outlook for 2020. Neel?"
260149,651052995,1914527,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2020",2020-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We",1396,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 
2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We met all our financial outlook metrics, specifically, adjusted EBITDA of $9.070 billion and free cash flow of $3.276 billion. For the full year 2019, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin to 40.5% compared to 38.6% for full year 2018, which represents a more than 500 basis point improvement since the Level 3 transaction. Over the course of 2019, through a series of capital market transactions, we reduced net debt by approximately $2 billion, delevering to 3.7x this quarter from 4x for the same period last year and 4.3x at the close of the Level 3 transaction. Over the last 12 months, we have also refinanced approximately $17 billion in long-term debt, reducing interest expense and extending maturities. And for the full year 2019, we achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. 
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2019, total revenue declined 4.4% to $22.4 billion. If you look at the year-over-year revenue decline for 2019, we estimate that about 25% to 30% of that decline was driven by actions we took to focus on profitable revenue in the failed sales leaseback accounting change that we described on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.6% to $5.57 billion. This compares to declines of 3.6% in the third quarter, 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we highlighted that we had about $40 million in nonrecurring revenue benefit. USF is up about the same amount this year compared to the fourth quarter 2018. So as you look at the year-over-year percentage change, it is representative of the underlying business. Sequentially, total revenue decreased 0.6% compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter and a decline of 1.2% in the second quarter. Also keep -- please keep in mind, the fourth quarter is typically stronger from a seasonality perspective, with the first quarter is when we usually see contract rerates, primarily for our largest customers. We also expect a decrease in USF rates by approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the rates in the fourth quarter 2019. As a reminder, this is pass-through revenue we collect for the FCC. 
Moving now to our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, IGAM declined 1.1%. On a sequential basis, IGAM grew 0.6% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, Enterprise revenue was roughly flat. We achieved our objective of improving the revenue trajectory for IGAM and Enterprise. Currency was a headwind, but adjusting for currency, which primarily impacts IGAM and excluding USF, both IGAM and Enterprise grew revenue for the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
SMB revenue decreased 3.3% year-over-year. This compares to a third quarter 2019 year-over-year decline of 6.5%. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.4% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 7.4% year-over-year. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 3% compared to an increase of 0.7% last quarter. As a reminder, we had a benefit of $15 million from a carrier settlement in the third quarter 2019. Excluding that carrier settlement, wholesale would have declined 1.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Consumer on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.5% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.9%, which compares to declines of 1.3% in the third quarter, 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 grew 2.1% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 2.3% last quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 53,000 subs. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $2.278 billion compared to $2.301 billion from the year ago quarter. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $9.070 billion, which compares to $9.040 billion for 2018. Despite more than $1 billion in revenue loss year-over-year, we achieved our objective of growing full year adjusted EBITDA, focusing on profitable revenue and our cost transformation efforts. For the fourth quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $940 million. For 2019, capital expenditures were $3.628 billion. We ramped up our CapEx spend by more than $450 million relative to 2018 as we focused on improving revenue trajectory. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $1.022 billion. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of $3.276 billion. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 11. On our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we outlined a 3-year plan to get to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Over the course of 2019, we have been very active in the capital markets. And through a series of transactions, we decreased net debt by approximately $2 billion. Additionally, since announcing our deleveraging plan last February, we have refinanced $17 billion or roughly half our debt. Our improved credit profile and constructive market conditions have enabled us to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. 
Turning to our maturity profile on Slide 12. At the end of 2018, for the 5-year period from 2020 through 2025, we had approximately $26 billion of debt maturing. As a result of our deleveraging and refinancing activities, we have reduced maturities by over $12 billion for the same period. For the full year 2020, we expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of this range implies net cash interest expense savings of more than $200 million compared to 2019 and more than $350 million compared to 2018. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.7x, and we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. These savings are part of our 3-year transformation plan that we outlined last year. Overall, we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the fourth quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $173 million and free cash flow by $33 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 and our outlook for the full year 2020. Please note all outlook measures exclude integration and transformation expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.2 billion and free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. The slight increase in our outlook relative to last year is primarily driven by increased fiber deployments for our enterprise, federal and consumer customers. In terms of notable items on working capital, we expect cash payments for other post-employment benefits, or OPEB, of approximately $200 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses. Also important to note, our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions to the pension fund. For 2020, we do not have any required contributions. 
In summary, we concluded 2019 with strong execution on several fronts. We improved the revenue trajectory for the overall business. We delivered on EBITDA growth and margin expansion as we successfully balanced, investing in our growth products, investing in customer experience and appropriately harvesting our declining products. In addition to interest expense savings, our deleveraging activities and capital market transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With our continued investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth and ongoing cost transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2020. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to Jeff."

And if you think about our trade working capital, DSOs and DPOs, just a day difference there could swing working capital by $100 million or so. And then there is capital, in general. So it's not perfect, but that's kind of the rough math in terms of the working capital -- the overall free cash flow range. 
And in terms of ARPU, I think, in general, as we are moving customers up from a bandwidth standpoint, especially into gig services, the ARPU is significantly higher.

Thank you very much, Mike. Appreciate the question. 
Before we end today's call, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts based on our progress in 2019 and the outlook for 2020. 
We are executing well on the capital allocation plan we announced last year. We are investing more in the business to drive growth and positioning our fiber network as the platform for delivering the solutions our customers need. We made excellent progress on our objective to reduce leverage, extend maturities and lower interest expense. And as you saw, our interest expense for 2020 is more than $300 million lower than we paid in 2018, and we still returned over $1 billion in the form of a dividend to our shareholders in 2019. 
For our IGAM and Enterprise business units, we met our objective for growth in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019, and we're optimistic about 2020. We had a solid start in our first year with our transformation initiatives, which not only improve the customer experience and increase efficiency throughout the organization, they reduce our cost to operate the business. We delivered $430 million in annualized run rate savings as of the end of 2019. We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network, and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on expanding our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network to all of our customers. All of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned with our overall guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share.

On today's call, I'll provide a recap on our progress in 2019 and how we're thinking about 2020 and beyond. Neel will provide an overview of our financial results, and then we'll go into your questions. 
We made good progress in 2019, transforming and positioning our business for the future while also delivering on our near-term objectives and meeting the guidance targets we provided at the beginning of the year. As I look back over the past 2 years, since the close of the Level 3 transaction, simply put, we've done exactly what we said we were going to do. 
As you can see on Slide 4, in 2018 and 2019, we met or exceeded all of the outlook measures we provided. We delivered 2 consecutive years of growth in adjusted EBITDA and 2 years of expanding margins. We also exceeded our integration synergy targets in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the deleveraging and transformation cost savings targets we shared with you in 2019. We have significantly ramped our free cash flow from premerger levels. Last year, as we said we would, we grew Enterprise and IGAM revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019. We still have a lot of work ahead, but I'm proud of the work our team has done, and we will remain focused and financially disciplined as we continue to drive our transformation. 
You've heard me say many times that our focus is on driving growth in both profitable revenue and free cash flow per share. Our strategy is fairly straightforward, and our 2019 capital investment program focused on 3 primary areas: Enhancing our product capabilities to meet the changing technology needs of our customers and the digital interactions they seek; increasing the size of our addressable market by continually expanding our fiber footprint; and improving our customer experience and reducing our cost to operate through simplification and automation. 
I'm pleased with the progress across all of these dimensions. As an example of expanding our addressable market in 2019, we built fiber to approximately 18,000 additional enterprise buildings, bringing our total count to around 170,000 fiber-fed on-net locations. We've prioritized fiber deployment for consumers over previous investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We now have enabled more than 2 million fiber households, a number we expect to continue to grow. And we're making it easier for our consumer customers to access these networks by standardizing our product set and enabling a digital environment. That digital environment allows customers to immediately initiate service using automated and seamless provisioning processes. In turn, this lowers our cost to operate and improves our customer experience. This type of transformation creates a virtuous cycle. We optimize our capabilities to reduce costs, which drives a better customer experience; and happy customers buy more and churn less. 
Beyond our capital investments, we continue to take steps to improve the profitability of CenturyLink's base business. We are slowly eliminating our linear video products and shut down initiatives to create a streaming video product. We continue to groom our enterprise customer base to identify and exit low margin contracts. We have deemphasized low margin CPE sales. We still sell CPE, but only in the context of larger network-centric and professional services deals. These moves, obviously, have a negative effect on revenue, but have a positive effect on free cash flow generation. We believe the majority of this low-quality revenue grooming is now behind us, but we remain disciplined with our focus on profitable revenue growth. 
We're also very active in grooming low-margin off-net circuits onto our own fiber facilities. This is a long, slow process, though. From a pure cost perspective, we achieved $850 million in run rate integration synergies in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the $800 million to $1 billion in transformation efficiencies we announced in 2019. We will continue to streamline our operating model and believe we have significant opportunities to continue to transform CenturyLink in the future. I'd like to cover one last highlight from 2019 before I discuss 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on 3 priorities: Increased capital spending to drive growth in the business. As examples, the addition of the 18,000 new on-net buildings, I mentioned, brings more customers locations on-net and gives us a strategic advantage and a better customer experience. Investment in our edge capabilities, coupled with our deep and extensive fiber network, places us at the forefront of the low latency, high transmission rate world of edge computing. Upgrading our global network with the largest deployment of ultra-low-loss fiber positions us well to continue winning in the long-haul fiber market, especially with hyperscale customers. Expanding our consumer fiber footprint enables growth in our high-speed broadband offerings. And lastly, as I just discussed, we believe investing in the transformation of our ""cash platforms"" not only drives operating efficiencies but also improves our customer experience and support our revenue growth initiatives across all of our customer segments. 
Our second objective was to reduce leverage with a target of 2.75x to 3.25x over 3 years. We reduced debt in 2019 by a little more than $2 billion. In addition to leverage reduction, we're taking advantage of our improved balance sheet and strong capital markets to lower our cost of capital and reduce interest rate risk. Neel will provide additional detail, but I'm very pleased with this work and believe it should drive improved equity value over time. 
Finally, we believe our dividend is a key part of our value proposition, and we returned more than $1 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2019. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And in 2020, you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business for growth and further reducing leverage. Our dividend policy is unchanged, giving us what we believe is a very manageable payout ratio in the 30s. 
Turning to 2020 on Slide 6. I'll discuss our 2020 priorities. You'll notice they look a lot like our 2019 priorities, which, by the way, is what discipline to a plan looks like. First, we want to continue to transform our operations to improve both the employee experience and the customer experience. Second, we want to continue to invest in growth through fiber deployment and enablement of fiber-related products and services, such as embedded security, dynamic connections, cloud application management and edge computing. Third, grow adjusted EBITDA through ongoing improvements in sales, operational efficiency and financial discipline; and fourth, continue to progress toward our 2.75x to 3.25x leverage target. Neel will cover the details of our financial outlook for 2020.
As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect our revenue trajectory to continue to improve. While we do not expect these improvements to be linear, we do expect better performance over the course of the year, and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue. As you know, we don't provide a forward-looking outlook for revenue, but we understand the importance of growing revenue, and we are very focused on that as a key objective. 
I'll briefly walk through commentary for each of our business groups. I'll start with IGAM. As a reminder, our International and Global Accounts Business encompasses our operations in LatAm, EMEA and APAC as well as our global accounts team, which serves a little more than 200 customers, customers, primarily based in North America that operate on a global scale. These 200 customers aren't necessarily our largest customers by revenue, but their needs match our global capabilities and they represent opportunities for growth. The IGAM business showed improvement in the second half of 2019, and we believe we can leverage our investments and market position to drive continuing improvement. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment, which includes both large and regional enterprises, generally for companies with more than 500 employees as well as our public sector group that includes all domestic, federal, state, local and research and education customers. In addition to our ubiquitous fiber network, I've long been a believer that operating locally is a key differentiator. Our local market strategy leverages about 25 teams of general managers, account managers, sales engineers and sales support that are locally positioned in key markets across the country. These local teams work directly with and know our customers and their markets. 
As many of our competitors have pulled back from a local model, we have continued to lean into it, creating what we believe is a distinct advantage for CenturyLink. This locally focused, customer-centered model, together with our far-reaching fiber network and the ability and willingness to effectively deploy capital to meet our customers' communications challenges, are leading an increasing number of customers to select CenturyLink. For example, the Texas Rangers announced in 2017 that they were planning to build a new enclosed ballpark to be ready for the 2020 baseball season, a ballpark that would require a new technology design to meet the needs of the team and the fans. They were focused on creating a one-of-a-kind experience for everyone at their home baseball games and additional events they hold throughout the year. The Rangers selected CenturyLink to support their smart stadium vision based on our multiple product capabilities, including our smart venue offering, professional services and hybrid networking portfolio, all riding over CenturyLink's diverse fiber connectivity into the stadium. 
Looking specifically at the public sector portion of our Enterprise segment highlights what I see as one of the key benefits of the combination of CenturyLink and Level 3. While both companies had a share of the federal business, we are seeing that the combined networks, together with our hybrid networking and other capabilities, have made us more competitive and are enabling us to win more new business than either company was able to do on its own. And if I may brag a bit, I also believe we have the best federal team in the business. 
I'll give you a few points that illustrate our growing success. After being selected as the first telecommunications provider to be awarded the authority to operate under the new EIS program, CenturyLink was then awarded the very first contract under EIS to provide core network services for NASA. We also recently announced a significant win with the Department of the Interior with a task order worth up to $1.6 billion over an 11-year period, which is even more significant as the DOI business was previously provided by a competitor. We've also recently announced wins with the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense Education Activity Network and the Census Bureau. We are excited about these wins, and we will continue to pursue growth in the public sector space, although I do want to caution that government contracts generally take several years to ramp. Our success with the federal government demonstrates what a skilled sales and support organization can do with a world-class network and leading-edge products. As with the various government entities, we are bringing these same capabilities to our enterprise and IGAM customers. 
Turning to SMB. We continue to see mixed results from this segment as revenue pressures from legacy services is far more than offsetting growth from new services and our expandable addressable market. However, we believe we can ultimately grow this segment and are investing in the products and platforms that are aligned to the unique needs of these customers. Our aim is to bring these customers the power of our network, security and other related services by enabling platforms that support high volume, frictionless transactions and make it easier and more efficient for these customers to access our capabilities. You can expect to see us continue to invest in fiber to multi-tenant environment and focus on taking share where those investments are made. To complement this investment and the ongoing simplification of our SMB operating model, we are streamlining, while at the same time, enhancing our product portfolio to enable solutions tailored for the small and medium business market. This includes products like Unified Communications as a Service, embedded security and simplified LAN offerings, all that are seamlessly delivered and scalable based on the individual customers' needs. As I said, we're not yet where we expect to be in the SMB segment, but I am optimistic about our ability to improve performance over time. 
Our outlook for the Wholesale segment is largely unchanged, and we continue to expect revenue to decline, primarily driven by ongoing industry consolidation and technology evolution. However, technology evolution also gives us opportunities, and we are working closely with our wholesale customers to support their 5G initiatives as our expanding fiber footprint is a natural match for their needs. 
Within the Consumer business, 2019 was somewhat of a transitional year that highlighted 2 areas of focus: to focus on fiber as the premier last-mile access solution outside of our CAF II market; and the ramp down in our linear TV product. We believe our strategy to invest in fiber is paying off. Broadband revenue grew year-over-year each and every quarter in 2019. While we've seen declines in our low-speed broadband subscribers, we've seen great results with our high-speed subscribers. 
From the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we doubled the number of subscribers with speeds of 100 megabits or higher and nearly tripled the number of subscribers with 1 gig and higher. We believe the reason for this growth is the simple fact that fiber to the home, not hybrid fiber coax, not wireless, not even 5G, but fiber delivers the best experience for customers and is the most scalable for future services. As we all know from our own personal experience, consistent, resilient, high bandwidth connections are essential to today's consumers. 
Plainly put, while fiber isn't a practical solution in all markets or all neighborhoods, we take share where we invest in fiber directly to the home. We will continue to invest in our Consumer business, centered around 3 primary initiatives: Extending our fiber footprint in areas that make economic sense and ensuring we grow where we invest; improving our systems, tools and capabilities to create a simpler digital experience for our customers and to drive efficiencies to maximize cash flow from the declining parts of the business; and completing the CAF II build out. In addition, we like the framework we've seen over the last few weeks with the RDOF program and believe the FCC has done an excellent job in designing a program to enable access to underserved areas. We believe RDOF is a natural fit with CenturyLink's network and the robust fiber network capillarity from our CAF II position. We will pursue participation in RDOF where the economics make sense for us. 
While we remain an enterprise-centric company, we see clear value in what the Consumer business contributes to CenturyLink. By growing where we invest, driving efficiencies into our operating model and maximizing the contribution from the declining parts of consumer, we believe we can effectively manage EBITDA and cash flow contributions from this business. 
And I'd also like to update you on a couple of other consumer-related items. First, you may have seen several announcements at the end of 2019 of settlements with various attorneys general regarding the consumer billing practices lawsuits. As of last week, we've reached settlements with AGs in 5 states. In the fourth quarter, we took a $50 million charge for consumer-related AG and litigation matters. We continue to maintain our marketing and billing practices. We're properly disclosed and consistent with widely used industry practices, but we also saw the benefit of settling these cases to enable us to focus on continuing to improve the business. We still have some ongoing litigation related to the consumer business, but we've made significant steps towards putting these matters behind us. 
I'd also like to give you an update on our strategic review of the Consumer business. During our review, we had no preconceived notions or predetermined outcomes in mind. There were no sacred cows. Our goal was to scrutinize the business unit and determine how we could maximize shareholder value over the long term. To that end, we have engaged with parties that are interested in exploring the purchase of all or parts of the business. We also took a look at what we could do -- be doing better internally to drive additional value. In this aspect, we confirmed several things we already knew. First, we can continue to improve efficiency in the business. By simplifying our product offers and moving to a more digital experience, we believe we can improve efficiency as legacy revenues decline. 
Second, we can more effectively penetrate our fiber-fed areas. We still have opportunities within our existing fiber footprint to drive higher penetration rates and are implementing new initiatives to do so. Third, that we should continue to expand our addressable market through further fiber deployment. We win where we invest in fiber-fed neighborhoods. Fiber is a superior solution, and we have demonstrated the ability to take share where we invest. As I mentioned, we are focusing on fiber as our preferred access solution in the consumer broadband market. We remain open to all value-enhancing opportunities and continue to engage with parties interested in transactions or partnership opportunities as we always would. But our focus right now is to continue to expand our fiber footprint, improve the operating model and extract costs from the business, which creates the best long-term value for the company and for our shareholders under any scenario. 
I will tell you that the team here sees the value in our network, platforms, products and our approach to customers, and we are excited about 2020. We hear from our customers that our willingness to invest, our differentiated service experience and our solutions capabilities make a difference in their ability to achieve their goals for 2020 and beyond. We continue to invest in our fiber network to drive greater revenue from our existing fiber infrastructure and invest in simplification and automation of our business, both to take out costs and to improve the customer experience. As we execute on that strategy, we believe we will drive sustainable long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and the outlook for 2020. Neel?"

Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We",1396,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on Slide 7. 
2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We met all our financial outlook metrics, specifically, adjusted EBITDA of $9.070 billion and free cash flow of $3.276 billion. For the full year 2019, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin to 40.5% compared to 38.6% for full year 2018, which represents a more than 500 basis point improvement since the Level 3 transaction. Over the course of 2019, through a series of capital market transactions, we reduced net debt by approximately $2 billion, delevering to 3.7x this quarter from 4x for the same period last year and 4.3x at the close of the Level 3 transaction. Over the last 12 months, we have also refinanced approximately $17 billion in long-term debt, reducing interest expense and extending maturities. And for the full year 2019, we achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. 
Moving to revenue. For the full year 2019, total revenue declined 4.4% to $22.4 billion. If you look at the year-over-year revenue decline for 2019, we estimate that about 25% to 30% of that decline was driven by actions we took to focus on profitable revenue in the failed sales leaseback accounting change that we described on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. 
Turning to Slide 8. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.6% to $5.57 billion. This compares to declines of 3.6% in the third quarter, 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we highlighted that we had about $40 million in nonrecurring revenue benefit. USF is up about the same amount this year compared to the fourth quarter 2018. So as you look at the year-over-year percentage change, it is representative of the underlying business. Sequentially, total revenue decreased 0.6% compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter and a decline of 1.2% in the second quarter. Also keep -- please keep in mind, the fourth quarter is typically stronger from a seasonality perspective, with the first quarter is when we usually see contract rerates, primarily for our largest customers. We also expect a decrease in USF rates by approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the rates in the fourth quarter 2019. As a reminder, this is pass-through revenue we collect for the FCC. 
Moving now to our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 2.1%. On a constant currency basis, IGAM declined 1.1%. On a sequential basis, IGAM grew 0.6% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, Enterprise revenue was roughly flat. We achieved our objective of improving the revenue trajectory for IGAM and Enterprise. Currency was a headwind, but adjusting for currency, which primarily impacts IGAM and excluding USF, both IGAM and Enterprise grew revenue for the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
SMB revenue decreased 3.3% year-over-year. This compares to a third quarter 2019 year-over-year decline of 6.5%. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.4% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 7.4% year-over-year. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 3% compared to an increase of 0.7% last quarter. As a reminder, we had a benefit of $15 million from a carrier settlement in the third quarter 2019. Excluding that carrier settlement, wholesale would have declined 1.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Consumer on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.5% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.9%, which compares to declines of 1.3% in the third quarter, 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 grew 2.1% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 2.3% last quarter. In the fourth quarter, we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 53,000 subs. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $2.278 billion compared to $2.301 billion from the year ago quarter. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $9.070 billion, which compares to $9.040 billion for 2018. Despite more than $1 billion in revenue loss year-over-year, we achieved our objective of growing full year adjusted EBITDA, focusing on profitable revenue and our cost transformation efforts. For the fourth quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $940 million. For 2019, capital expenditures were $3.628 billion. We ramped up our CapEx spend by more than $450 million relative to 2018 as we focused on improving revenue trajectory. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $1.022 billion. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of $3.276 billion. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 11. On our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we outlined a 3-year plan to get to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Over the course of 2019, we have been very active in the capital markets. And through a series of transactions, we decreased net debt by approximately $2 billion. Additionally, since announcing our deleveraging plan last February, we have refinanced $17 billion or roughly half our debt. Our improved credit profile and constructive market conditions have enabled us to reduce interest expense and extend maturities. 
Turning to our maturity profile on Slide 12. At the end of 2018, for the 5-year period from 2020 through 2025, we had approximately $26 billion of debt maturing. As a result of our deleveraging and refinancing activities, we have reduced maturities by over $12 billion for the same period. For the full year 2020, we expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of this range implies net cash interest expense savings of more than $200 million compared to 2019 and more than $350 million compared to 2018. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.7x, and we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75x to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. These savings are part of our 3-year transformation plan that we outlined last year. Overall, we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the fourth quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $173 million and free cash flow by $33 million. 
Turning to Slide 13 and our outlook for the full year 2020. Please note all outlook measures exclude integration and transformation expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.2 billion and free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. The slight increase in our outlook relative to last year is primarily driven by increased fiber deployments for our enterprise, federal and consumer customers. In terms of notable items on working capital, we expect cash payments for other post-employment benefits, or OPEB, of approximately $200 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses. Also important to note, our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions to the pension fund. For 2020, we do not have any required contributions. 
In summary, we concluded 2019 with strong execution on several fronts. We improved the revenue trajectory for the overall business. We delivered on EBITDA growth and margin expansion as we successfully balanced, investing in our growth products, investing in customer experience and appropriately harvesting our declining products. In addition to interest expense savings, our deleveraging activities and capital market transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With our continued investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth and ongoing cost transformation initiatives, we are well positioned for 2020. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to Jeff."

And if you think about our trade working capital, DSOs and DPOs, just a day difference there could swing working capital by $100 million or so. And then there is capital, in general. So it's not perfect, but that's kind of the rough math in terms of the working capital -- the overall free cash flow range. 
And in terms of ARPU, I think, in general, as we are moving customers up from a bandwidth standpoint, especially into gig services, the ARPU is significantly higher.

I don't have an exact percentage, but there is a fair amount that we use to drive the operational efficiencies, the digitalization of our business, the tools and the processes that we use with our customers to drive out costs and drive up the customer experience."

We are connected with every cloud provider across the U.S., but really across the world. And we have great connectivity into them. We're creating solutions that allow our customers to manage their infrastructure more efficiently, things like dynamic connections, where they can scale bandwidth up and down, redirect it from 1 provider to another -- from 1 cloud provider to another cloud provider if they want. Things like cloud application management, where they can look a layer higher and look at their cloud applications and how are they running. And so I think it starts with the connectivity, the fiber base, the high speed, the low-latency connectivity, coupled with embedded security to make it a reliable and safe environment for them, coupled with our network-related services to make it easier for our customers to manage, coupled with a great team. And I talked about our federal team on how great, I think, they are. But we also have great enterprise and GAM teams in small and medium business teams. We have a great team going out and driving the success. So I think that our success, over time, in the short term and in the long term, comes down to our ability to leverage our network with great products and make sure that we're positioning them in front of our customers properly through great sales, and we're executing on delivering them through a great operations group. And so I think it comes down to we win, if we execute with the network and the services we have."

And so we look at how do we leverage all of those capabilities. So for us, I think that, yes, we have parts of our business that are declining. But we face the truth on those. We recognize them for what they are. We manage them for contribution while we have them, and we lean into the growth of the things that we think will grow, like edge compute, like the other cloud capabilities that I've talked about, like pure bandwidth and transmission rates that are going to continue to go up.

Thank you very much, Mike. Appreciate the question. 
Before we end today's call, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts based on our progress in 2019 and the outlook for 2020. 
We are executing well on the capital allocation plan we announced last year. We are investing more in the business to drive growth and positioning our fiber network as the platform for delivering the solutions our customers need. We made excellent progress on our objective to reduce leverage, extend maturities and lower interest expense. And as you saw, our interest expense for 2020 is more than $300 million lower than we paid in 2018, and we still returned over $1 billion in the form of a dividend to our shareholders in 2019. 
For our IGAM and Enterprise business units, we met our objective for growth in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019, and we're optimistic about 2020. We had a solid start in our first year with our transformation initiatives, which not only improve the customer experience and increase efficiency throughout the organization, they reduce our cost to operate the business. We delivered $430 million in annualized run rate savings as of the end of 2019. We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network, and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on expanding our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network to all of our customers. All of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned with our overall guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share.

I hope you and your families are staying safe and in good health. Obviously, this isn't a normal earnings season. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation and the world, we at CenturyLink have adjusted our priorities and even our approach to the business. On today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results but during the majority of my time, I'll discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our company and my thoughts on the industry in general. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year, then we'll open it up for your questions. 
I want to start by highlighting the incredible efforts of our employees during this crisis to support each other, our customers and the communities where we live. In early March, we sent 75% of our employees to work from home. Literally, overnight, they implemented processes and tools to remain effective in the new environment and did so without missing a beat. But not all of our employees can work from home. We have nearly 10,000 essential workers, whose job supporting our customers and enhancing and maintaining our network requires that they continue to work from work. While I am proud of all of our employees, I am especially proud of the work from work employees who remain in the field and in our network control centers, delivering for the emergency needs of our customers and operating our global network so effectively. 
Our team has responded to every obstacle with determination, dedication and resiliency, the same characteristics they bring to their work to transform and grow our business. I can't tell you how proud I am of our employees, and I feel very fortunate to be part of this team. For those of you on the call who are shareholders, your employees are doing a great job, and I wanted to start the call with a huge thank you to all 42,000 men and women around the globe. 
Before I get into the details of our response to the ongoing crisis, I'll make just a few comments about the quarter. During the quarter, we remain focused on profitable growth, transformation of our service delivery platforms and cost reduction initiatives, and we continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins. As you know, at the beginning of 2019, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on investing for growth and reducing leverage, while continuing to return more than $1 billion a year to shareholders through our dividend, Slide 4 in the presentation. We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business and to give us flexibility to weather future economic and environment changes. As a result, our liquidity position is strong. We are in a good path to reach the leverage target we established and we feel good about our dividend payout ratio. While we are confident about our liquidity position, given the difficulty in predicting the shape and timing of an economic recovery, we have withdrawn the guidance we provided for EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow. 
Slide 5 provides a summary of our response to the crisis. I'll start with the measures we put in place to support our employees and how they've been responding. From the beginning, we have been clear in our approach that the employees' safety is our #1 priority. Well ahead of government recommendations to adopt social distancing guidelines, we limited meeting sizes, eliminated travel and canceled company events. Ultimately, in early March, we transitioned the vast majority of our staff to work from home. Halting the spread of the virus among our employees and the communities in which they live was our primary goal. We implemented an emergency paid time off program and extended short-term disability coverage to all U.S. employees to allow those directly touched by the virus greater flexibility and an increased sense of financial security. Protecting our essential employees, whether in the field or in our offices, was a special focus. 
Although now resolved, initially, we were challenged to meet the ever-changing recommendations for personal protective equipment. Our principal concern was protecting employees and customers during face-to-face interactions. As a further protected step, we accelerated the implementation of a customer self-service model, allowing a higher percentage of our customers to install and repair their own connections. But the main thing we did to protect our technicians was to reinforce that they had full authority to make their own safety decisions. If our technicians don't feel they can perform a specific task safely, they know they have the right to say no, with no second guessing of their decision. If you know anything about the culture and work ethic of the network tech community, you'll not be surprised to hear that these men and women have taken on the special challenges presented by this crisis with the same customer focus that has long been their hallmark. 
Finally, we've been clear with our employees that we will be very deliberate in our plans to return to our offices. That means returning to many of our locations will likely extend beyond government time lines. Frankly, I doubt we ever go back to the way things were before. As a manager, I was hesitant about embracing a distributed workforce, but the performance of our employees over the past 2 months has demonstrated that we can remain highly effective when working digitally from home. That performance allows us to be deliberate in our return and more broad minded about how we work together in the future. We will take our time and accelerate our own digital transformation as we look at the future of work within CenturyLink. 
As proud as I am of our employees, I'm equally proud of our customers' responses to the needs of their employees and customers and communities. Across both the public and private sectors, our customers have moved quickly to upgrade their digital infrastructure to enable distributed workforces and to meet the emergency needs of their communities. We have seen remarkable agility across our entire customer base from insurance companies to health care providers; from government agencies to financial services companies; from video and audio conferencing companies to individual consumers. We have been proud to support customers as diverse as the Social Security Administration, State Farm, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Hazelden Betty Ford Clinic, Banner Engineering and M&T Tech, just to name a few. Our customers move quickly to increase capacity, deploy more robust VPN capabilities and add security services and for our consumer customers to establish or improve the connectivity required to adapt to what we now all appreciate to be the shocking reality of working from home and home schooling children. CenturyLink has taken broad steps to support these efforts, including some instances, turning up connectivity in a matter of hours and extensive capacity increases for our enterprise customers. 
COVID-19 will affect every aspect of our business, but I'm especially concerned about the financial health of our smallest business customers. These businesses form such a critical part of our local communities and they may lack the resources to weather disruptions of this magnitude. For small businesses with fewer than 50 employees and our consumer customers, we have currently suspended usage limits and committed not to disconnect or charge late fees. Recently, we extended our commitment to the SEC's Keep America Connected pledge through June. We will continue to assess how we can help support customers who need assistance to sustain themselves until the economy returns to more normal conditions. By working to support all of our customers as they work through their own challenges, our actions and performance reinforce that CenturyLink is a trusted partner. I've been inspired to see how our customers have met the demands of this crisis. We should all be encouraged that the commitment, energy and creativity seen in these responses will carry us forward as we begin to reopen the economy. 
We've also stepped up our community support efforts. We've donated bandwidth to frontline locations across our footprint, such as the USNS Mercy Hospital Ship in California and other temporary health care facilities across the country. We've established corporate and employee giving campaigns. We will continue to seek ways to support our communities but we believe the most important relief we can provide is to continue to ensure our customers have the connectivity they need to respond to the demands of this crisis. The global pandemic has highlighted and accelerated the digital transformation we and our customers were already experiencing in how we live and work together. But over the past 2 months, we have seen a step function increase in the speed of those changes. I am very proud of our employees and our network's ability to meet that accelerated demand. Compared to typical traffic levels, we have seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly, significant increase in average usage across our CDN, end user IT, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high. Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage, but the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us. 
The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform and capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber, it is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures. Our network is built to flex in response to, in the moment, traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex, the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world. 
We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration towards digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision-making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. We believe the critical nature of our services and the renewed importance of digital transformation means this will only be a pause and that our capabilities, close relationships with customers position us well for the economic recovery. We are watching our small business segment closely. While not yet seeing an increase in churn, this is an area of concern and attention. 
With our consumer customers, particularly in the early days, we received requests for speed upgrades, along with a rise in overall order volumes. This increased activity demonstrates something we've discussed before, where we invest in fiber and providing higher speeds, we take share in the consumer market. Broadband is a utility you don't want to live without these days. However, given the rise in unemployment numbers, we are watching consumer churn carefully. 
The acceleration of digital transformation, driven by COVID-19 presents a wide range of opportunities for CenturyLink. Our far-reaching and powerful fiber network, together with services like embedded security, edge computing, IT enablement and managed services make us a key enabler of digital transformation across our economy. In fact, virtually all of our services have been designed for the digital economy. This crisis has reinforced the value of those services to our customers and our response has highlighted our ability to meet their evolving needs quickly and effectively. We believe all of this validates the value of our business, going forward. At the same time, legacy communications spend will continue to decline, and we know we have to adapt to a lower cost, more customer-friendly digital support model to meet the demands of the future. Our response to this crisis has accelerated some of those plans and later in the call, Neel will discuss our progress against our transformation efficiencies. 
The digital transformation is about far more than reducing cost. It is fundamentally about eliminating the barriers of distance and enhancing how people interact, both with each other and with the data that is relevant to their businesses and lines. We believe the current prices, along with the broader deployment of AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things, edge computing and the like, will accelerate the march toward digital transformation and that CenturyLink is well positioned to support and benefit. 
To be clear, we anticipate a negative effect on our near-term results. We have seen some increased demand, but our business is ultimately only as successful as the businesses of our customers. Nonetheless, we believe this crisis has highlighted that the services we offer are at the very heart of the digital economy. We are financially stable, investing in the capabilities our customers need, continuing to digitally transform our own customer interactions and facilitating and assisting our customers as they seek to realize the benefits from these ongoing technology trends. 
I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and our revised outlook for 2020. Neel?"
260149,661943606,1974404,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. I wish you all good health in these difficult times. Before we get into the details of the quarter and a discussion of how COVID-19 is impacting the business, I'll provide a few high level remarks. First, o",2262,"Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. I wish you all good health in these difficult times. Before we get into the details of the quarter and a discussion of how COVID-19 is impacting the business, I'll provide a few high level remarks. 
First, our liquidity position is strong, and we are confident about our ability to manage through this crisis. As we navigate these uncertain times, we are pleased with the capital market actions we took over the last year to position the business for the long term. Although we could have never envisioned the pandemic, the current situation further underlines the resilience of our long-term approach to capital allocation. We are exiting the first quarter well positioned to continue investing in the business, delever and support our dividend policy. 
Second, we saw continued improvement in our overall revenue performance and expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. While we expect to see revenue pressure given COVID-19 and related economic forecast, we are fortunate to have a diverse revenue base by industry, geography and customer size. 
Third, the changes we've already seen in how we live, work and interact with each other, highlight the importance of the services we offer and where we are investing. We believe this crisis validates our strategy and we are continuing to invest in these essential services in our operational and digital transformation. However, as we look at the remainder of the year, we do expect to see pressure on both revenue and the speed with which we continue to take costs out of the business as a result of COVID-19. 
With the current uncertainty, particularly as it relates to timing for an economic recovery, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures. Given our confidence in our liquidity position and focus on free cash flow, we have reaffirmed our deleveraging target and current dividend policy. 
Moving now to our first quarter results on Slide 6. I'll highlight a couple of things. We saw an improvement in our revenue trajectory this quarter and we made additional progress on our cost transformation initiatives. We are now at $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expanded margins by more than 100 basis points compared to the year ago quarter to 42.9%. We continue to improve our maturity profile and exited the quarter in a strong liquidity position. 
Turning to Slide 7. Our revenue is largely recurring from a well-diversified customer base, which will help us manage through this economic cycle. Although some of our customers will be highly impacted by the pandemic, we believe the connectivity services we provide are critical to their operations. The industries we expect to be highly impacted, as defined on this slide, represent about $1 billion in annualized revenue or approximately 5% of total revenue. As we look across the business, we believe the largest area of risk is the SMB business unit. So far, we haven't seen any significant lengthening of SMB receivables. As we consider the risk within the business unit, I'll note, on an annualized basis, approximately $250 million or less than 10% of revenue in our SMB channel are from highly impacted industries. In terms of customer size, customers with less than 50 employees represent approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenues. 
Turning to first quarter revenue results on Slide 8. On a year-over-year basis, for the first quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.7% to $5.2 billion compared to 5.1% in the first quarter of 2019. We have seen steady improvement in our revenue trajectory over the last few quarters. Sequentially, total revenue declined 1.5% compared to a decline of 2.2% in the first quarter of 2019. 
Moving to Slide 9 and revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts or IGAM revenue was roughly flat and grew 1.3% on a constant currency basis. This compares to a decline of 4.7% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 0.6% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to a decline of 3.5% in the first quarter of 2019. 
Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.4% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 2.1% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, enterprise declined 1% compared to a decline of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2019, which is the typical seasonality we see in the first quarter of each year. In the short-term for both IGAM and enterprise, we expect the demand impact from cancellation of live events and customers deferring major network buying decisions. However, the funnel remains strong and the theme from current customer conversations has been a delay of around 60 to 90 days, but with no fundamental change in long-term demand for our services. In fact, several of our customers are evaluating accelerating their own digital transformation, which we expect to be a benefit over the long term. 
SMB revenue decreased 6% year-over-year, in line with the average year-over-year decline of 6.5% in 2019, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we look at SMB for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier, this is an area of concern. We are working closely with these customers as they are critical, not only to CenturyLink, but the entire U.S. economy. Thus far, we have not seen a material change in churn, but we are closely monitoring the situation. It is also important to note that SMB is an opportunity for us, and we will continue to focus on increasing market share in our on-net buildings. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 6.1% in the first quarter 2019. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 2.5% compared to a decline of 3.3% in the first quarter of 2019. With respect to wholesale, just as we are doing, we expect customers in this segment will continue to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment, which may put pressure on revenue in the coming quarters. Additionally, as many of their enterprise customers did for buying decisions, we would expect to see the second order impact. 
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the first quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by legacy voice revenue. Broadband revenue for the first quarter 2020 was flat year-over-year. We continue to focus on improving broadband revenue performance by our targeted fiber investments and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. In the first quarter, we saw a net loss of 11,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 60,000 subs. From a consumer standpoint, as work-from-home began to ramp, we saw an immediate increase in new orders and requests for speed upgrades. Within the context of social distancing, our field technicians are doing a good job keeping up with order volumes. As we recover from COVID-19, we don't expect the pendulum to swing back all the way, positioning us well for the long term. At this point, we haven't seen a material increase in overall churn, accounts receivable or bad debt. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the first quarter 2020. The adjusted EBITDA was $2.243 billion compared to $2.262 billion in the first quarter 2019. We continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 42.9% compared to 41.7% in the year ago quarter. Despite a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately $200 million this quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable as we focused on cost transformation and profitable revenue growth. Regarding the COVID impact, we saw pluses and minuses during the first quarter. These items are hard to quantify, but we believe the net impact is a slight negative to first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA, primarily driven by reduced activity in the last 2 to 3 weeks of March. 
In terms of bad debt expense, at the beginning of the year, we adopted ASC 326. At this time, we have not seen any changes to any of our metrics and cannot accurately predict with any certainty how the changing economic environment will impact our overall bad debt. We did not increase our bad debt reserves in the first quarter of 2020. But we do expect to see an increase in bad debt, specifically in our SMB and consumer segments. And we'll have more to say on our second quarter earnings call. 
As of the end of the first quarter, we achieved approximately $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. However, social distancing and prioritization of other critical activities did impact the pace of our cost transformation efforts and are expected to continue to impact some of our initiatives in the near term. For example, we are experiencing delays in real estate site exits and off-net to on-net migrations as our customers are working from home or are focused on their own responses to CCOVID-19. 
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans. The opportunities have not changed and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expect to accelerate as the current situation improves. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the first quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $34 million and free cash flow by $82 million. 
For the first quarter of 2020, capital expenditures were $974 million. This compares to first quarter 2019 CapEx of $931 million. We increased our CapEx spend as we prepare for the COVID-19 crisis by investing in inventory, in the event of any supply chain disruption. However, to date, we have not seen disruptions for network equipment. Given the environment, we are going to be very measured in terms of how we spend capital. Generally speaking, our CapEx spending is success-based. Going forward, we are ensuring that capital spending is well aligned with sales and volume growth on the network. We may reduce spending in certain areas in the near term, such as buildings that are predominantly driven by SMB or other high-risk demand.  We are continuing to invest through this uncertain time, primarily in long life assets, like fiber, where we see predictable returns. 
In the first quarter of 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $407 million. This compares to free cash flow of $315 million in the year ago quarter. This year, consistent with prior years, we saw higher use of cash in the first quarter due to higher working capital associated with annual bonus payments, prepayments on maintenance contracts and payroll taxes. The growth in free cash flow was driven by improvements in net cash interest and is a function of our deleveraging plans. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, we completed $10 billion in refinancings in January of this year. In addition, we completed over $90 million of open market purchases in March. And subsequent to the close of the quarter, we paid down $1 billion of debt at maturity. As you can see on Slide 13, we have very little in maturities in the near term. 
I wanted to take a moment and touch on our pension fund. At year-end 2019, the funded status of our pension was 86%. We generally report our pension funded status, only on an annual basis. However, given current conditions, we are providing an update as of the end of the first quarter. Exiting the first quarter, our funding status was approximately 83%. We have significantly derisked the plan over the past 18 months and are pleased with our position, particularly given current market performance and volatility. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, there are no funding requirements in the near term. 
Let's now move to a discussion of our financial outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 14. The current situation brings several layers of uncertainty. It is hard to predict when the economy will recover or when enterprises will return to predictable buying patterns. Over the long term, our ability to work effectively with our customers is the primary indicator of growth. In the short term, we do believe the economy will affect the behavior of our customers. With that in mind, we do not believe that we are able to estimate the full year financial impact of COVID-19 with reasonable accuracy and are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures at this time. All other measures remain unchanged. 
To summarize, our revenue base is diversified and largely recurring, and the services we sell are essential to our customers. Given the tough decisions we made regarding capital allocation last year, we have the ability to invest in growth through this cycle. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. With respect to the dividend, we modeled multiple downside scenarios and under all scenarios, we expect our payout ratio to remain in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow. As such, we remain comfortable with our dividend policy. Finally, we remain committed to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. However, it may take us a quarter or 2 longer than originally planned. 
Before I wrap up, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees, who have been performing extremely well during this pandemic. With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

In terms of new projects, broadly defined, I think the funnel is still strong and so the fundamental demand picture hasn't changed. The general conversation tone has been kind of a 60 to 90-day type delay. In SMB, we're still seeing sales but at lower levels than we did in March and we haven't seen any pickup for sure."

Can you help us understand a little bit in terms of potential to continue to cut cost to offset some of that revenue pressure? 
And maybe just a follow-up on SME, do we have a sense of how many of your customers took the keep the client connected pledge and are nonpaying customers right now?"

But a couple of things to keep in mind. One, is we're largely a recurring revenue business. And the services that we provide are really critical to the customers. So even if you think about SMB and you think about connectivity, a lot of the services we provide are supporting point of sale systems, security cameras, things like that, critical to their operations. So it's still early days. So if you think about cost reductions that these businesses have undertaken, has been around reducing headcount but the infrastructure is still in place. So the revenue is hard to tell. 
On the cost transformation side, the delays we've had are more around where social distancing is an issue. But as things tend to improve, we'll accelerate on our cost transformation. So we have a lot of levers there. But like you know that, in the near term, like Jeff emphasized, we have the financial flexibility to do the right things to support our customers, to provide things to support our employees. So we will have a financial impact in the near term. But we have a lot of levers by the time we get to free cash flow. And so we'll be managing costs tightly. We'll be calibrating our capital, although we'll be investing, we'll be calibrating our capital to demand and sales, and we feel pretty good at the free cash flow level. And like I mentioned, the models, the scenarios we've modeled, all of them are in the 30s in terms of dividend being as a percentage of free cash flow."

But what we've seen is our customers need our products and services more than -- now more than ever. They're relevant. They're capable products and services to meet their challenges. We've done a great job of executing and delivering for those customers. And I've gotten a number of e-mails from CEOs and department heads, thanking me for what we've been able to do in very short periods of time. 
And so we do -- there is a lot of uncertainty. But it's not long-term uncertainty, it's short term uncertainty. What is the shape of the recovery curve look like? When do we get started? And some of that affects our capital deployment and our cost savings. So for example, on capital, getting permits and hotel rooms for construction crews and that and type of thing in our rural environment with CAF build-outs. If you look at our cost savings initiatives that are affected by this, things like converting off-net to on-net, our customers aren't in their offices. We can't convert them off-net to on-net when they're not there. And so until some of those things clear up, the visibility is a little bit hard but there's nothing about this that has done anything other than reinforce that the products and services we have are exactly where our customers are headed and exactly what they need."

And on your second question on reductions, that's been an ongoing process for us. We've, in fact, slowed down in the interim. But that's part of our overall cost transformation initiative. And it really is a function of resource allocation shift from legacy products, which are declining. So we're rightsizing the cost structure there, and we're adding in areas where we're investing.

That's probably something that we will slow down in the coming months as part of our looking and waiting and seeing what happens with small and medium enterprise customers. So we'll continue to pay close attention to it, but we didn't have any market performance declines in our ability to add buildings. 
From a consumer perspective, we are very serious about investing fiber to -- through our micro-targeting strategy that we've talked about before. And it's successful. We want to invest fiber where we can afford to do so. And wherever we invest fiber, we grow and we drive penetration out. And so we'll continue to do that. Overall, we're a fiber company. We've continued to invest capital to expand and augment the fiber network in more locations, take better use of edge computing, all of the different trends that we see in the market."

We're not necessarily leaning into it, but we will make sure that we look and stay abreast of all the different opportunities.  
I think we have time for one more question. No questions left, right? Well, let me do a quick wrap-up and close the call with a few key thoughts. While we're still in the early days and there are a lot of unknowns, one thing I feel certain is that the demand for fiber and for the services we provide are more important than ever. And I've said this a couple of times on the call, CenturyLink though, will also rise to the challenge to meet the customer needs. And we've seen that in spades over the last 2 months. So very pleased with how we've been performing. 
COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation efforts, both of ours and our customers. And so we'll continue to see our network-related services are critical to supporting those efforts. Our actions last year to shift our capital allocation strategy and focus capital on deleveraging and investing in the business to place CenturyLink in a strong financial position with ample liquidity and comfortable payout ratios and manageable maturities for the next few years even in the midst of so much uncertainty, we believe we're well positioned to weather the near-term financial impacts of COVID and to take advantage of the ongoing digital transformation to drive long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
I normally end with a focus on our free cash flow per share. Today, I'll close by repeating what I said at the beginning of the call. I'm very proud of our employees and we will continue to keep their health and safety as our top priority. Thank you for joining today's call and for your interest in CenturyLink.

I hope you and your families are staying safe and in good health. Obviously, this isn't a normal earnings season. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation and the world, we at CenturyLink have adjusted our priorities and even our approach to the business. On today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results but during the majority of my time, I'll discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our company and my thoughts on the industry in general. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll open it up for your questions.  
I want to start by highlighting the incredible efforts of our employees during this crisis to support each other, our customers and the communities where we live. In early March, we sent 75% of our employees to work from home. Literally overnight, they implemented processes and tools to remain effective in the new environment and did so without missing a beat. But not all of our employees can work from home. We have nearly 10,000 essential workers, whose job supporting our customers and enhancing and maintaining our network requires that they continue to work from work. While I am proud of all of our employees, I am especially proud of the work from work employees who remain in the field and in our network control centers, delivering for the emergency needs of our customers and operating our global network so effectively.  
Our team has responded to every obstacle with determination, dedication and resiliency, the same characteristics they bring to their work to transform and grow our business. I can't tell you how proud I am of our employees, and I feel very fortunate to be part of this team.  
For those of you on the call who are shareholders, your employees are doing a great job, and I wanted to start the call with a huge thank you to all 42,000 men and women around the globe.  
Before I get into the details of our response to the ongoing crisis, I'll make just a few comments about the quarter. During the quarter, we remain focused on profitable growth, transformation of our service delivery platforms and cost reduction initiatives, and we continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins. As you know, at the beginning of 2019, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on investing for growth and reducing leverage while continuing to return more than $1 billion a year to shareholders through our dividend, Slide 4 in the presentation. We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business and to give us flexibility to weather future economic and environment changes. As a result, our liquidity position is strong. We are in a good path to reach the leverage target we established, and we feel good about our dividend payout ratio.  
While we are confident about our liquidity position, given the difficulty in predicting the shape and timing of an economic recovery, we have withdrawn the guidance we provided for EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow.  
Slide 5 provides a summary of our response to the crisis. I'll start with the measures we put in place to support our employees and how they've been responding. From the beginning, we have been clear in our approach that the employees' safety is our #1 priority. Well ahead of government recommendations to adopt social distancing guidelines, we limited meeting sizes, eliminated travel and canceled company events. Ultimately, in early March, we transitioned the vast majority of our staff to work from home, halting the spread of the virus among our employees and the communities in which they live was our primary goal. We implemented an emergency paid time off program and extended short-term disability coverage to all U.S. employees to allow those directly touched by the virus greater flexibility and an increased sense of financial security. Protecting our essential employees, whether in the field or in our offices, was a special focus. Although now resolved, initially, we were challenged to meet the ever-changing recommendations for personal protective equipment. Our principal concern was protecting employees and customers during face-to-face interactions. As a further protected step, we accelerated the implementation of a customer self-service model, allowing a higher percentage of our customers to install and repair their own connections. But the main thing we did to protect our technicians was to reinforce that they had full authority to make their own safety decisions. If our technicians don't feel they can perform a specific task safely, they know they have the right to say no, with no second guessing of their decision. If you know anything about the culture and work ethic of the network tech community, you'll not be surprised to hear that these men and women have taken on the special challenges presented by this crisis with the same customer focus that has long been their hallmark.  
Finally, we've been clear with our employees that we will be very deliberate in our plans to return to our offices. That means returning to many of our locations will likely extend beyond government time lines. Frankly, I doubt we ever go back to the way things were before. As a manager, I was hesitant about embracing a distributed workforce, but the performance of our employees over the past 2 months has demonstrated that we can remain highly effective when working digitally from home. That performance allows us to be deliberate in our return and more broad minded about how we work together in the future. We will take our time and accelerate our own digital transformation as we look at the future of work within CenturyLink.  
As proud as I am of our employees, I'm equally proud of our customers' responses to the needs of their employees and customers and communities. Across both the public and private sectors, our customers have moved quickly to upgrade their digital infrastructure to enable distributed workforces and to meet the emergency needs of their communities. We have seen remarkable agility across our entire customer base from insurance companies to health care providers; from government agencies to financial services companies; from video and audio conferencing companies to individual consumers. We have been proud to support customers as diverse as the Social Security Administration, State Farm, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Hazelden Betty Ford clinic, Banner Engineering and M&T Tech, just to name a few.  
Our customers move quickly to increase capacity, deploy more robust VPN capabilities and add security services and for our consumer customers to establish or improve the connectivity required to adapt to what we now all appreciate to be the shocking reality of working from home and home schooling children. CenturyLink has taken broad steps to support these efforts, including some instances, turning up connectivity in a matter of hours and extensive capacity increases for our enterprise customers.  
COVID-19 will affect every aspect of our business, but I'm especially concerned about the financial health of our smallest business customers. These businesses form such a critical part of our local communities and they may lack the resources to weather disruptions of this magnitude. For small businesses with fewer than 50 employees and our consumer customers, we have currently suspended usage limits and committed not to disconnect or charge late fees. Recently, we extended our commitment to the SEC's Keep America Connected pledge through June. We will continue to assess how we can help support customers who need assistance to sustain themselves until the economy returns to more normal conditions.  
By working to support all of our customers as they work through their own challenges, our actions and performance reinforce that CenturyLink is a trusted partner. I've been inspired to see how our customers have met the demands of this crisis. We should all be encouraged that the commitment, energy and creativity seen in these responses will carry us forward as we begin to reopen the economy.  
We've also stepped up our community support efforts. We've donated bandwidth to frontline locations across our footprint, such as the USNS Mercy hospital ship in California and other temporary health care facilities across the country. We've established corporate and employee giving campaigns. We will continue to seek ways to support our communities. But we believe the most important relief we can provide is to continue to ensure our customers have the connectivity they need to respond to the demands of this crisis. The global pandemic has highlighted and accelerated the digital transformation we and our customers were already experiencing in how we live and work together. But over the past 2 months, we have seen a step function increase in the speed of those changes. I am very proud of our employees and our network's ability to meet that accelerated demand. 
Compared to typical traffic levels, we have seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly, significant increase in average usage across our CDN, end user IT, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high. Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage, but the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us.  
The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform of capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber, it is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures. Our network is built to flex in response to in the moment traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex, the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world.  
We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration towards digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision-making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. We believe the critical nature of our services and the renewed importance of digital transformation means this will only be a pause and that our capabilities, close relationships with customers position us well for the economic recovery. 
We are watching our small business segment closely. While not yet seeing an increase in churn, this is an area of concern and attention. With our consumer customers, particularly in the early days, we received requests for speed upgrades, along with a rise in overall order volumes. This increased activity demonstrates something we've discussed before. Where we invest in fiber and providing higher speeds, we take share in the consumer market. Broadband is a utility you don't want to live without these days. However, given the rise in unemployment numbers, we are watching consumer churn carefully.  
The acceleration of digital transformation, driven by COVID-19 presents a wide range of opportunities for CenturyLink. Our far-reaching and powerful fiber network, together with services like embedded security, edge computing, IT enablement and managed services make us a key enabler of digital transformation across our economy. In fact, virtually all of our services have been designed for the digital economy. This crisis has reinforced the value of those services to our customers and our response has highlighted our ability to meet their evolving needs quickly and effectively. We believe all of this validates the value of our business going forward.  
At the same time, legacy communications spend will continue to decline, and we know we have to adapt to a lower cost, more customer-friendly digital support model to meet the demands of the future. Our response to this crisis has accelerated some of those plans. And later in the call, Neel will discuss our progress against our transformation efficiencies.  
The digital transformation is about far more than reducing cost. It is fundamentally about eliminating the barriers of distance and enhancing how people interact, both with each other and with the data that is relevant to their businesses and lines. We believe the current prices, along with the broader deployment of AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things, edge computing and the like, will accelerate the march toward digital transformation and that CenturyLink is well positioned to support and benefit.  
To be clear, we anticipate a negative effect on our near-term results. We have seen some increased demand, but our business is ultimately only as successful as the businesses of our customers. Nonetheless, we believe this crisis has highlighted that the services we offer are at the very heart of the digital economy. We are financially stable, investing in the capabilities our customers need, continuing to digitally transform our own customer interactions and facilitating and assisting our customers as they seek to realize the benefits from these ongoing technology trends.  
I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and our revised outlook for 2020. Neel?"
260149,661943606,1974521,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. I wish you all good health in these difficult times. Before we get into the details of the quarter and a discussion of how COVID-19 is impacting the business, I'll provide a few high level remarks.  First,",2255,"Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. I wish you all good health in these difficult times. Before we get into the details of the quarter and a discussion of how COVID-19 is impacting the business, I'll provide a few high level remarks.  
First, our liquidity position is strong, and we are confident about our ability to manage through this crisis. As we navigate these uncertain times, we are pleased with the capital market actions we took over the last year to position the business for the long term. Although we could have never envisioned the pandemic, the current situation further underlines the resilience of our long-term approach to capital allocation. We are exiting the first quarter well positioned to continue investing in the business, delever and support our dividend policy.  
Second, we saw continued improvement in our overall revenue performance and expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. While we expect to see revenue pressure given COVID-19 and related economic forecast, we are fortunate to have a diverse revenue base by industry, geography and customer size.  
Third, the changes we've already seen in how we live, work and interact with each other highlight the importance of the services we offer and where we are investing. We believe this crisis validates our strategy and we are continuing to invest in these essential services in our operational and digital transformation. However, as we look at the remainder of the year, we do expect to see pressure on both revenue and the speed with which we continue to take costs out of the business as a result of COVID-19. With the current uncertainty, particularly as it relates to timing for an economic recovery, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures. Given our confidence in our liquidity position and focus on free cash flow, we have reaffirmed our deleveraging target and current dividend policy.  
Moving now to our first quarter results on Slide 6. I'll highlight a couple of things. We saw an improvement in our revenue trajectory this quarter and we made additional progress on our cost transformation initiatives. We are now at $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expanded margins by more than 100 basis points compared to the year ago quarter to 42.9%. We continue to improve our maturity profile and exited the quarter in a strong liquidity position.  
Turning to Slide 7. Our revenue is largely recurring from a well-diversified customer base, which will help us manage through this economic cycle. Although some of our customers will be highly impacted by the pandemic, we believe the connectivity services we provide are critical to their operations. The industries we expect to be highly impacted, as defined on this slide, represent about $1 billion in annualized revenue or approximately 5% of total revenue.  
As we look across the business, we believe the largest area of risk is the SMB business unit. So far, we haven't seen any significant lengthening of SMB receivables. As we consider the risk within the business unit, I'll note, on an annualized basis, approximately $250 million or less than 10% of revenue in our SMB channel are from highly impacted industries. In terms of customer size, customers with less than 50 employees represent approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenues.  
Turning to first quarter revenue results on Slide 8. On a year-over-year basis, for the first quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.7% to $5.2 billion compared to 5.1% in the first quarter of 2019. We have seen steady improvement in our revenue trajectory over the last few quarters. Sequentially, total revenue declined 1.5% compared to a decline of 2.2% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to Slide 9 and revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts or IGAM revenue was roughly flat and grew 1.3% on a constant currency basis. This compares to a decline of 4.7% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 0.6% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to a decline of 3.5% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.4% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 2.1% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, enterprise declined 1% compared to a decline of 2.4% in the first quarter 2019, which is the typical seasonality we see in the first quarter of each year. In the short term for both IGAM and enterprise, we expect the demand impact from cancellation of live events and customers deferring major network buying decisions. However, the funnel remains strong and the theme from current customer conversations has been a delay of around 60 to 90 days, but with no fundamental change in long-term demand for our services. In fact, several of our customers are evaluating accelerating their own digital transformation, which we expect to be a benefit over the long term.  
SMB revenue decreased 6% year-over-year, in line with the average year-over-year decline of 6.5% in 2019, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we look at SMB for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier, this is an area of concern. We are working closely with these customers as they are critical, not only to CenturyLink, but the entire U.S. economy. Thus far, we have not seen a material change in churn, but we are closely monitoring the situation.  
It is also important to note that SMB is an opportunity for us, and we will continue to focus on increasing market share in our on-net buildings.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 6.1% in the first quarter 2019. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 2.5% compared to a decline of 3.3% in the first quarter 2019. With respect to wholesale, just as we are doing, we expect customers in this segment will continue to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment, which may put pressure on revenue in the coming quarters. Additionally, as many of their enterprise customers defer buying decisions, we would expect to see the second order impact.  
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the first quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by legacy voice revenue. Broadband revenue for the first quarter 2020 was flat year-over-year. We continue to focus on improving broadband revenue performance by our targeted fiber investments and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. In the first quarter, we saw a net loss of 11,000 total broadband subs in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 60,000 subs. From a consumer standpoint, as work-from-home began to ramp, we saw an immediate increase in new orders and requests for speed upgrades. Within the context of social distancing, our field technicians are doing a good job keeping up with order volumes.  
As we recover from COVID-19, we don't expect the pendulum to swing back all the way, positioning us well for the long term. At this point, we haven't seen a material increase in overall churn, accounts receivable or bad debt.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the first quarter 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was $2.243 billion compared to $2.262 billion in the first quarter 2019. We continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 42.9% compared to 41.7% in the year ago quarter. Despite a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately $200 million this quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable as we focused on cost transformation and profitable revenue growth.  
Regarding the COVID impact, we saw pluses and minuses during the first quarter. These items are hard to quantify, but we believe the net impact is a slight negative to first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA, primarily driven by reduced activity in the last 2 to 3 weeks of March.  
In terms of bad debt expense, at the beginning of the year, we adopted ASC 326. At this time, we have not seen any changes to any of our metrics and cannot accurately predict with any certainty how the changing economic environment will impact our overall bad debt. We did not increase our bad debt reserves in the first quarter 2020. But we do expect to see an increase in bad debt, specifically in our SMB and consumer segments. And we'll have more to say on our second quarter earnings call.  
As of the end of the first quarter, we achieved approximately $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. However, social distancing and prioritization of other critical activities did impact the pace of our cost transformation efforts and are expected to continue to impact some of our initiatives in the near term. For example, we are experiencing delays in real estate site exits and off-net to on-net migrations as our customers are working from home or are focused on their own responses to COVID-19.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans. The opportunities have not changed and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expect to accelerate as the current situation improves. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the first quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $34 million and free cash flow by $82 million.  
For the first quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $974 million. This compares to first quarter 2019 CapEx of $931 million. We increased our CapEx spend as we prepare for the COVID-19 crisis by investing in inventory in the event of any supply chain disruption. However, to date, we have not seen disruptions for network equipment. Given the environment, we are going to be very measured in terms of how we spend capital. Generally speaking, our CapEx spending is success-based. Going forward, we are ensuring that capital spending is well aligned with sales and volume growth on the network. We may reduce spending in certain areas in the near term, such as buildings that are predominantly driven by SMB or other high-risk demand.  
We are continuing to invest through this uncertain time, primarily in long life assets, like fiber, where we see predictable returns.  
In the first quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $407 million. This compares to free cash flow of $315 million in the year ago quarter. This year, consistent with prior years, we saw higher use of cash in the first quarter due to higher working capital associated with annual bonus payments, prepayments on maintenance contracts and payroll taxes. The growth in free cash flow was driven by improvements in net cash interest and is a function of our deleveraging plans.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, we completed $10 billion in refinancings in January of this year. In addition, we completed over $90 million of open market purchases in March. And subsequent to the close of the quarter, we paid down $1 billion of debt at maturity.  
As you can see on Slide 13, we have very little in maturities in the near term.  
I wanted to take a moment and touch on our pension fund. At year-end 2019, the funded status of our pension was 86%. We generally report our pension funded status only on an annual basis. However, given current conditions, we are providing an update as of the end of the first quarter. Exiting the first quarter, our funding status was approximately 83%. We have significantly derisked the plan over the past 18 months and are pleased with our position, particularly given current market performance and volatility. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, there are no funding requirements in the near term.  
Let's now move to a discussion of our financial outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 14. The current situation brings several layers of uncertainty. It is hard to predict when the economy will recover or when enterprises will return to predictable buying patterns. Over the long term, our ability to work effectively with our customers is the primary indicator of growth. In the short term, we do believe the economy will affect the behavior of our customers. With that in mind, we do not believe that we are able to estimate the full year financial impact of COVID-19 with reasonable accuracy and are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures at this time. All other measures remain unchanged.  
To summarize, our revenue base is diversified and largely recurring. And the services we sell are essential to our customers. Given the tough decisions we made regarding capital allocation last year, we have the ability to invest in growth through this cycle. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. With respect to the dividend, we modeled multiple downside scenarios. And under all scenarios, we expect our payout ratio to remain in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow. As such, we remain comfortable with our dividend policy. Finally, we remain committed to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. However, it may take us a quarter or 2 longer than originally planned.  
Before I wrap up, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees, who have been performing extremely well during this pandemic. With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

So it's been really network upgrades, enabling their employees to work from home, increasing capacity into their data centers. So we're supporting all of those initiatives.  
In terms of new projects, broadly defined, I think the funnel is still strong and so the fundamental demand picture hasn't changed. The general conversation tone has been kind of a 60- to 90-day type delay. In SMB, we're still seeing sales but at lower levels than we did in March and we haven't seen any pickup for sure."

And maybe just a follow-up on SME. Do we have a sense of how many of your customers took the keep the client connected pledge and are nonpaying customers right now?"
260149,661943606,1974521,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","So I'll start with your revenue pressure question, Batya.

But a couple of things to keep in mind. One is we're largely a recurring revenue business. And the services that we provide are really critical to the customers. So even if you think about SMB and you think about connectivity, a lot of the services we provide are supporting point of sale systems, security cameras, things like that, critical to their operations. So it's still early days. So if you think about cost reductions that these businesses have undertaken, has been around reducing headcount but the infrastructure is still in place. So the revenue is hard to tell. 
On the cost transformation side, the delays we've had are more around where social distancing is an issue. But as things tend to improve, we'll accelerate on our cost transformation. So we have a lot of levers there. But like you noted, in the near term, like Jeff emphasized, we have the financial flexibility to do the right things to support our customers, to provide things to support our employees. So we will have a financial impact in the near term. But we have a lot of levers by the time we get to free cash flow. And so we'll be managing costs tightly. We'll be calibrating our capital, although we'll be investing, we'll be calibrating our capital to demand and sales, and we feel pretty good at the free cash flow level. And like I mentioned, the models, the scenarios we've modeled, all of them are in the 30s in terms of dividend being as a percentage of free cash flow."

That's the difference this time. The market does dictate, to some extent, the timing of our ability to win. But what we've seen is our customers need our products and services more than -- now more than ever. They're relevant. They're capable products and services to meet their challenges. We've done a great job of executing and delivering for those customers. And I've gotten a number of e-mails from CEOs and department heads, thanking me for what we've been able to do in very short periods of time. 
And so we do -- there is a lot of uncertainty. But it's not long-term uncertainty, it's short term uncertainty. What does the shape of the recovery curve look like? When do we get started? And some of that affects our capital deployment and our cost savings. So for example, on capital, getting permits and hotel rooms for construction crews and that type of thing in our rural environment with CAF build-outs. If you look at our cost savings initiatives that are affected by this, things like converting off-net to on-net, our customers aren't in their offices. We can't convert them off-net to on-net when they're not there. And so until some of those things clear up, the visibility is a little bit hard. But there's nothing about this that has done anything other than reinforce that the products and services we have are exactly where our customers are headed and exactly what they need."

So we'll continue to pay close attention to it, but we didn't have any market performance declines in our ability to add buildings. 
From a consumer perspective, we are very serious about investing fiber to -- through our micro-targeting strategy that we've talked about before. And it's successful. We want to invest fiber where we can afford to do so. And wherever we invest fiber, we grow and we drive penetration out. And so we'll continue to do that. Overall, we're a fiber company. We've continued to invest capital to expand and augment the fiber network in more locations, take better use of edge computing, all of the different trends that we see in the market."

We're not necessarily leaning into it, but we will make sure that we look and stay abreast of all the different opportunities.  
I think we have time for one more question. No questions left, right? Well, let me do a quick wrap-up and close the call with a few key thoughts. While we're still in the early days and there are a lot of unknowns, one thing I feel certain is that the demand for fiber and for the services we provide are more important than ever. And I've said this a couple of times on the call, CenturyLink though, will also rise to the challenge to meet the customer needs. And we've seen that in spades over the last 2 months. So very pleased with how we've been performing. 
COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation efforts, both of ours and our customers. And so we'll continue to see our network-related services are critical to supporting those efforts. Our actions last year to shift our capital allocation strategy and focus capital on deleveraging and investing in the business to place CenturyLink in a strong financial position with ample liquidity, comfortable payout ratios and manageable maturities for the next few years. Even in the midst of so much uncertainty, we believe we're well positioned to weather the near-term financial impacts of COVID and to take advantage of the ongoing digital transformation to drive long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
I normally end with a focus on our free cash flow per share. Today, I'll close by repeating what I said at the beginning of the call. I'm very proud of our employees and we will continue to keep their health and safety as our top priority. Thank you for joining today's call and for your interest in CenturyLink.

I hope you and your families are staying safe and in good health. Obviously, this isn't a normal earnings season. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation and the world, we at CenturyLink have adjusted our priorities and even our approach to the business. On today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results but during the majority of my time, I'll discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our company and my thoughts on the industry in general. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll open it up for your questions.  
I want to start by highlighting the incredible efforts of our employees during this crisis to support each other, our customers and the communities where we live. In early March, we sent 75% of our employees to work from home. Literally overnight, they implemented processes and tools to remain effective in the new environment and did so without missing a beat. But not all of our employees can work from home. We have nearly 10,000 essential workers, whose job supporting our customers and enhancing and maintaining our network requires that they continue to work from work. While I am proud of all of our employees, I am especially proud of the work from work employees who remain in the field and in our network control centers, delivering for the emergency needs of our customers and operating our global network so effectively.  
Our team has responded to every obstacle with determination, dedication and resiliency, the same characteristics they bring to their work to transform and grow our business. I can't tell you how proud I am of our employees, and I feel very fortunate to be part of this team.  
For those of you on the call who are shareholders, your employees are doing a great job, and I wanted to start the call with a huge thank you to all 42,000 men and women around the globe.  
Before I get into the details of our response to the ongoing crisis, I'll make just a few comments about the quarter. During the quarter, we remain focused on profitable growth, transformation of our service delivery platforms and cost reduction initiatives, and we continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins. As you know, at the beginning of 2019, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on investing for growth and reducing leverage while continuing to return more than $1 billion a year to shareholders through our dividend, Slide 4 in the presentation. We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business and to give us flexibility to weather future economic and environment changes. As a result, our liquidity position is strong. We are in a good path to reach the leverage target we established, and we feel good about our dividend payout ratio.  
While we are confident about our liquidity position, given the difficulty in predicting the shape and timing of an economic recovery, we have withdrawn the guidance we provided for EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow.  
Slide 5 provides a summary of our response to the crisis. I'll start with the measures we put in place to support our employees and how they've been responding. From the beginning, we have been clear in our approach that the employees' safety is our #1 priority. Well ahead of government recommendations to adopt social distancing guidelines, we limited meeting sizes, eliminated travel and canceled company events. Ultimately, in early March, we transitioned the vast majority of our staff to work from home, halting the spread of the virus among our employees and the communities in which they live was our primary goal. We implemented an emergency paid time off program and extended short-term disability coverage to all U.S. employees to allow those directly touched by the virus greater flexibility and an increased sense of financial security. Protecting our essential employees, whether in the field or in our offices, was a special focus. Although now resolved, initially, we were challenged to meet the ever-changing recommendations for personal protective equipment. Our principal concern was protecting employees and customers during face-to-face interactions. As a further protected step, we accelerated the implementation of a customer self-service model, allowing a higher percentage of our customers to install and repair their own connections. But the main thing we did to protect our technicians was to reinforce that they had full authority to make their own safety decisions. If our technicians don't feel they can perform a specific task safely, they know they have the right to say no, with no second guessing of their decision. If you know anything about the culture and work ethic of the network tech community, you'll not be surprised to hear that these men and women have taken on the special challenges presented by this crisis with the same customer focus that has long been their hallmark.  
Finally, we've been clear with our employees that we will be very deliberate in our plans to return to our offices. That means returning to many of our locations will likely extend beyond government time lines. Frankly, I doubt we ever go back to the way things were before. As a manager, I was hesitant about embracing a distributed workforce, but the performance of our employees over the past 2 months has demonstrated that we can remain highly effective when working digitally from home. That performance allows us to be deliberate in our return and more broad minded about how we work together in the future. We will take our time and accelerate our own digital transformation as we look at the future of work within CenturyLink.  
As proud as I am of our employees, I'm equally proud of our customers' responses to the needs of their employees and customers and communities. Across both the public and private sectors, our customers have moved quickly to upgrade their digital infrastructure to enable distributed workforces and to meet the emergency needs of their communities. We have seen remarkable agility across our entire customer base from insurance companies to health care providers; from government agencies to financial services companies; from video and audio conferencing companies to individual consumers. We have been proud to support customers as diverse as the Social Security Administration, State Farm, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Hazelden Betty Ford clinic, Banner Engineering and M&T Tech, just to name a few.  
Our customers move quickly to increase capacity, deploy more robust VPN capabilities and add security services and for our consumer customers to establish or improve the connectivity required to adapt to what we now all appreciate to be the shocking reality of working from home and home schooling children. CenturyLink has taken broad steps to support these efforts, including some instances, turning up connectivity in a matter of hours and extensive capacity increases for our enterprise customers.  
COVID-19 will affect every aspect of our business, but I'm especially concerned about the financial health of our smallest business customers. These businesses form such a critical part of our local communities and they may lack the resources to weather disruptions of this magnitude. For small businesses with fewer than 50 employees and our consumer customers, we have currently suspended usage limits and committed not to disconnect or charge late fees. Recently, we extended our commitment to the SEC's Keep America Connected pledge through June. We will continue to assess how we can help support customers who need assistance to sustain themselves until the economy returns to more normal conditions.  
By working to support all of our customers as they work through their own challenges, our actions and performance reinforce that CenturyLink is a trusted partner. I've been inspired to see how our customers have met the demands of this crisis. We should all be encouraged that the commitment, energy and creativity seen in these responses will carry us forward as we begin to reopen the economy.  
We've also stepped up our community support efforts. We've donated bandwidth to frontline locations across our footprint, such as the USNS Mercy hospital ship in California and other temporary health care facilities across the country. We've established corporate and employee giving campaigns. We will continue to seek ways to support our communities. But we believe the most important relief we can provide is to continue to ensure our customers have the connectivity they need to respond to the demands of this crisis. The global pandemic has highlighted and accelerated the digital transformation we and our customers were already experiencing in how we live and work together. But over the past 2 months, we have seen a step function increase in the speed of those changes. I am very proud of our employees and our network's ability to meet that accelerated demand. 
Compared to typical traffic levels, we have seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly, significant increase in average usage across our CDN, end user IT, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high. Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage, but the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us.  
The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform of capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber, it is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures. Our network is built to flex in response to in the moment traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex, the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world.  
We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration towards digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision-making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. We believe the critical nature of our services and the renewed importance of digital transformation means this will only be a pause and that our capabilities, close relationships with customers position us well for the economic recovery. 
We are watching our small business segment closely. While not yet seeing an increase in churn, this is an area of concern and attention. With our consumer customers, particularly in the early days, we received requests for speed upgrades, along with a rise in overall order volumes. This increased activity demonstrates something we've discussed before. Where we invest in fiber and providing higher speeds, we take share in the consumer market. Broadband is a utility you don't want to live without these days. However, given the rise in unemployment numbers, we are watching consumer churn carefully.  
The acceleration of digital transformation, driven by COVID-19 presents a wide range of opportunities for CenturyLink. Our far-reaching and powerful fiber network, together with services like embedded security, edge computing, IT enablement and managed services make us a key enabler of digital transformation across our economy. In fact, virtually all of our services have been designed for the digital economy. This crisis has reinforced the value of those services to our customers and our response has highlighted our ability to meet their evolving needs quickly and effectively. We believe all of this validates the value of our business going forward.  
At the same time, legacy communications spend will continue to decline, and we know we have to adapt to a lower cost, more customer-friendly digital support model to meet the demands of the future. Our response to this crisis has accelerated some of those plans. And later in the call, Neel will discuss our progress against our transformation efficiencies.  
The digital transformation is about far more than reducing cost. It is fundamentally about eliminating the barriers of distance and enhancing how people interact, both with each other and with the data that is relevant to their businesses and lines. We believe the current prices, along with the broader deployment of AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things, edge computing and the like, will accelerate the march toward digital transformation and that CenturyLink is well positioned to support and benefit.  
To be clear, we anticipate a negative effect on our near-term results. We have seen some increased demand, but our business is ultimately only as successful as the businesses of our customers. Nonetheless, we believe this crisis has highlighted that the services we offer are at the very heart of the digital economy. We are financially stable, investing in the capabilities our customers need, continuing to digitally transform our own customer interactions and facilitating and assisting our customers as they seek to realize the benefits from these ongoing technology trends.  
I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and our revised outlook for 2020. Neel?"

Second, we saw continued improvement in our overall revenue performance and expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. While we expect to see revenue pressure given COVID-19 and related economic forecast, we are fortunate to have a diverse revenue base by industry, geography and customer size.  
Third, the changes we've already seen in how we live, work and interact with each other highlight the importance of the services we offer and where we are investing. We believe this crisis validates our strategy and we are continuing to invest in these essential services in our operational and digital transformation. However, as we look at the remainder of the year, we do expect to see pressure on both revenue and the speed with which we continue to take costs out of the business as a result of COVID-19. With the current uncertainty, particularly as it relates to timing for an economic recovery, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures. Given our confidence in our liquidity position and focus on free cash flow, we have reaffirmed our deleveraging target and current dividend policy.  
Moving now to our first quarter results on Slide 6. I'll highlight a couple of things. We saw an improvement in our revenue trajectory this quarter and we made additional progress on our cost transformation initiatives. We are now at $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expanded margins by more than 100 basis points compared to the year ago quarter to 42.9%. We continue to improve our maturity profile and exited the quarter in a strong liquidity position.  
Turning to Slide 7. Our revenue is largely recurring from a well-diversified customer base, which will help us manage through this economic cycle. Although some of our customers will be highly impacted by the pandemic, we believe the connectivity services we provide are critical to their operations. The industries we expect to be highly impacted, as defined on this slide, represent about $1 billion in annualized revenue or approximately 5% of total revenue.  
As we look across the business, we believe the largest area of risk is the SMB business unit. So far, we haven't seen any significant lengthening of SMB receivables. As we consider the risk within the business unit, I'll note, on an annualized basis, approximately $250 million or less than 10% of revenue in our SMB channel are from highly impacted industries. In terms of customer size, customers with less than 50 employees represent approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenues.  
Turning to first quarter revenue results on Slide 8. On a year-over-year basis, for the first quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.7% to $5.2 billion compared to 5.1% in the first quarter of 2019. We have seen steady improvement in our revenue trajectory over the last few quarters. Sequentially, total revenue declined 1.5% compared to a decline of 2.2% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to Slide 9 and revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts or IGAM revenue was roughly flat and grew 1.3% on a constant currency basis. This compares to a decline of 4.7% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 0.6% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to a decline of 3.5% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.4% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 2.1% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, enterprise declined 1% compared to a decline of 2.4% in the first quarter 2019, which is the typical seasonality we see in the first quarter of each year. In the short term for both IGAM and enterprise, we expect the demand impact from cancellation of live events and customers deferring major network buying decisions. However, the funnel remains strong and the theme from current customer conversations has been a delay of around 60 to 90 days, but with no fundamental change in long-term demand for our services. In fact, several of our customers are evaluating accelerating their own digital transformation, which we expect to be a benefit over the long term.  
SMB revenue decreased 6% year-over-year, in line with the average year-over-year decline of 6.5% in 2019, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we look at SMB for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier, this is an area of concern. We are working closely with these customers as they are critical, not only to CenturyLink, but the entire U.S. economy. Thus far, we have not seen a material change in churn, but we are closely monitoring the situation.  
It is also important to note that SMB is an opportunity for us, and we will continue to focus on increasing market share in our on-net buildings.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 6.1% in the first quarter 2019. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 2.5% compared to a decline of 3.3% in the first quarter 2019. With respect to wholesale, just as we are doing, we expect customers in this segment will continue to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment, which may put pressure on revenue in the coming quarters. Additionally, as many of their enterprise customers defer buying decisions, we would expect to see the second order impact.  
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the first quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by legacy voice revenue. Broadband revenue for the first quarter 2020 was flat year-over-year. We continue to focus on improving broadband revenue performance by our targeted fiber investments and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. In the first quarter, we saw a net loss of 11,000 total broadband subs in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 60,000 subs. From a consumer standpoint, as work-from-home began to ramp, we saw an immediate increase in new orders and requests for speed upgrades. Within the context of social distancing, our field technicians are doing a good job keeping up with order volumes.  
As we recover from COVID-19, we don't expect the pendulum to swing back all the way, positioning us well for the long term. At this point, we haven't seen a material increase in overall churn, accounts receivable or bad debt.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the first quarter 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was $2.243 billion compared to $2.262 billion in the first quarter 2019. We continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 42.9% compared to 41.7% in the year ago quarter. Despite a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately $200 million this quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable as we focused on cost transformation and profitable revenue growth.  
Regarding the COVID impact, we saw pluses and minuses during the first quarter. These items are hard to quantify, but we believe the net impact is a slight negative to first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA, primarily driven by reduced activity in the last 2 to 3 weeks of March.  
In terms of bad debt expense, at the beginning of the year, we adopted ASC 326. At this time, we have not seen any changes to any of our metrics and cannot accurately predict with any certainty how the changing economic environment will impact our overall bad debt. We did not increase our bad debt reserves in the first quarter 2020. But we do expect to see an increase in bad debt, specifically in our SMB and consumer segments. And we'll have more to say on our second quarter earnings call.  
As of the end of the first quarter, we achieved approximately $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. However, social distancing and prioritization of other critical activities did impact the pace of our cost transformation efforts and are expected to continue to impact some of our initiatives in the near term. For example, we are experiencing delays in real estate site exits and off-net to on-net migrations as our customers are working from home or are focused on their own responses to COVID-19.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans. The opportunities have not changed and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expect to accelerate as the current situation improves. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the first quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $34 million and free cash flow by $82 million.  
For the first quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $974 million. This compares to first quarter 2019 CapEx of $931 million. We increased our CapEx spend as we prepare for the COVID-19 crisis by investing in inventory in the event of any supply chain disruption. However, to date, we have not seen disruptions for network equipment. Given the environment, we are going to be very measured in terms of how we spend capital. Generally speaking, our CapEx spending is success-based. Going forward, we are ensuring that capital spending is well aligned with sales and volume growth on the network. We may reduce spending in certain areas in the near term, such as buildings that are predominantly driven by SMB or other high-risk demand.  
We are continuing to invest through this uncertain time, primarily in long life assets, like fiber, where we see predictable returns.  
In the first quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $407 million. This compares to free cash flow of $315 million in the year ago quarter. This year, consistent with prior years, we saw higher use of cash in the first quarter due to higher working capital associated with annual bonus payments, prepayments on maintenance contracts and payroll taxes. The growth in free cash flow was driven by improvements in net cash interest and is a function of our deleveraging plans.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, we completed $10 billion in refinancings in January of this year. In addition, we completed over $90 million of open market purchases in March. And subsequent to the close of the quarter, we paid down $1 billion of debt at maturity.  
As you can see on Slide 13, we have very little in maturities in the near term.  
I wanted to take a moment and touch on our pension fund. At year-end 2019, the funded status of our pension was 86%. We generally report our pension funded status only on an annual basis. However, given current conditions, we are providing an update as of the end of the first quarter. Exiting the first quarter, our funding status was approximately 83%. We have significantly derisked the plan over the past 18 months and are pleased with our position, particularly given current market performance and volatility. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, there are no funding requirements in the near term.  
Let's now move to a discussion of our financial outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 14. The current situation brings several layers of uncertainty. It is hard to predict when the economy will recover or when enterprises will return to predictable buying patterns. Over the long term, our ability to work effectively with our customers is the primary indicator of growth. In the short term, we do believe the economy will affect the behavior of our customers. With that in mind, we do not believe that we are able to estimate the full year financial impact of COVID-19 with reasonable accuracy and are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures at this time. All other measures remain unchanged.  
To summarize, our revenue base is diversified and largely recurring. And the services we sell are essential to our customers. Given the tough decisions we made regarding capital allocation last year, we have the ability to invest in growth through this cycle. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. With respect to the dividend, we modeled multiple downside scenarios. And under all scenarios, we expect our payout ratio to remain in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow. As such, we remain comfortable with our dividend policy. Finally, we remain committed to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. However, it may take us a quarter or 2 longer than originally planned.  
Before I wrap up, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees, who have been performing extremely well during this pandemic. With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

In terms of new projects, broadly defined, I think the funnel is still strong and so the fundamental demand picture hasn't changed. The general conversation tone has been kind of a 60- to 90-day type delay. In SMB, we're still seeing sales but at lower levels than we did in March and we haven't seen any pickup for sure."

And maybe just a follow-up on SME. Do we have a sense of how many of your customers took the keep the client connected pledge and are nonpaying customers right now?"
260149,661943606,2016747,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","So I'll start with your revenue pressure question, Batya.

But a couple of things to keep in mind. One is we're largely a recurring revenue business. And the services that we provide are really critical to the customers. So even if you think about SMB and you think about connectivity, a lot of the services we provide are supporting point of sale systems, security cameras, things like that, critical to their operations. So it's still early days. So if you think about cost reductions that these businesses have undertaken, has been around reducing headcount but the infrastructure is still in place. So the revenue is hard to tell. 
On the cost transformation side, the delays we've had are more around where social distancing is an issue. But as things tend to improve, we'll accelerate on our cost transformation. So we have a lot of levers there. But like you noted, in the near term, like Jeff emphasized, we have the financial flexibility to do the right things to support our customers, to provide things to support our employees. So we will have a financial impact in the near term. But we have a lot of levers by the time we get to free cash flow. And so we'll be managing costs tightly. We'll be calibrating our capital, although we'll be investing, we'll be calibrating our capital to demand and sales, and we feel pretty good at the free cash flow level. And like I mentioned, the models, the scenarios we've modeled, all of them are in the 30s in terms of dividend being as a percentage of free cash flow."

We've done a great job of executing and delivering for those customers. And I've gotten a number of e-mails from CEOs and department heads, thanking me for what we've been able to do in very short periods of time. 
And so we do -- there is a lot of uncertainty. But it's not long-term uncertainty, it's short term uncertainty. What does the shape of the recovery curve look like? When do we get started? And some of that affects our capital deployment and our cost savings. So for example, on capital, getting permits and hotel rooms for construction crews and that type of thing in our rural environment with CAF build-outs. If you look at our cost savings initiatives that are affected by this, things like converting off-net to on-net, our customers aren't in their offices. We can't convert them off-net to on-net when they're not there. And so until some of those things clear up, the visibility is a little bit hard. But there's nothing about this that has done anything other than reinforce that the products and services we have are exactly where our customers are headed and exactly what they need."

But it really is just can we get hotels in rural areas, can we get permits in urban areas. How do we continue to expand the footprint. We are continuing to expand the footprint in the first quarter for our enterprise customers. We continue to add buildings. I think we're somewhere around 4,500 buildings. That's probably something that we will slow down in the coming months as part of our looking and waiting and seeing what happens with small and medium enterprise customers. So we'll continue to pay close attention to it, but we didn't have any market performance declines in our ability to add buildings. 
From a consumer perspective, we are very serious about investing fiber to -- through our micro-targeting strategy that we've talked about before. And it's successful. We want to invest fiber where we can afford to do so. And wherever we invest fiber, we grow and we drive penetration out. And so we'll continue to do that. Overall, we're a fiber company. We've continued to invest capital to expand and augment the fiber network in more locations, take better use of edge computing, all of the different trends that we see in the market."

We're not necessarily leaning into it, but we will make sure that we look and stay abreast of all the different opportunities.  
I think we have time for one more question. No questions left, right? Well, let me do a quick wrap-up and close the call with a few key thoughts. While we're still in the early days and there are a lot of unknowns, one thing I feel certain is that the demand for fiber and for the services we provide are more important than ever. And I've said this a couple of times on the call, CenturyLink though, will also rise to the challenge to meet the customer needs. And we've seen that in spades over the last 2 months. So very pleased with how we've been performing. 
COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation efforts, both of ours and our customers. And so we'll continue to see our network-related services are critical to supporting those efforts. Our actions last year to shift our capital allocation strategy and focus capital on deleveraging and investing in the business to place CenturyLink in a strong financial position with ample liquidity, comfortable payout ratios and manageable maturities for the next few years. Even in the midst of so much uncertainty, we believe we're well positioned to weather the near-term financial impacts of COVID and to take advantage of the ongoing digital transformation to drive long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
I normally end with a focus on our free cash flow per share. Today, I'll close by repeating what I said at the beginning of the call. I'm very proud of our employees and we will continue to keep their health and safety as our top priority. Thank you for joining today's call and for your interest in CenturyLink.

I hope you and your families are staying safe and in good health. Obviously, this isn't a normal earnings season. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation and the world, we at CenturyLink have adjusted our priorities and even our approach to the business. On today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our first quarter results but during the majority of my time, I'll discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our company and my thoughts on the industry in general. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll open it up for your questions.  
I want to start by highlighting the incredible efforts of our employees during this crisis to support each other, our customers and the communities where we live. In early March, we sent 75% of our employees to work from home. Literally overnight, they implemented processes and tools to remain effective in the new environment and did so without missing a beat. But not all of our employees can work from home. We have nearly 10,000 essential workers, whose job supporting our customers and enhancing and maintaining our network requires that they continue to work from work. While I am proud of all of our employees, I am especially proud of the work from work employees who remain in the field and in our network control centers, delivering for the emergency needs of our customers and operating our global network so effectively.  
Our team has responded to every obstacle with determination, dedication and resiliency, the same characteristics they bring to their work to transform and grow our business. I can't tell you how proud I am of our employees, and I feel very fortunate to be part of this team.  
For those of you on the call who are shareholders, your employees are doing a great job, and I wanted to start the call with a huge thank you to all 42,000 men and women around the globe.  
Before I get into the details of our response to the ongoing crisis, I'll make just a few comments about the quarter. During the quarter, we remain focused on profitable growth, transformation of our service delivery platforms and cost reduction initiatives, and we continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins. As you know, at the beginning of 2019, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on investing for growth and reducing leverage while continuing to return more than $1 billion a year to shareholders through our dividend, Slide 4 in the presentation. We believe this was the right decision for the long-term health of the business and to give us flexibility to weather future economic and environment changes. As a result, our liquidity position is strong. We are in a good path to reach the leverage target we established, and we feel good about our dividend payout ratio.  
While we are confident about our liquidity position, given the difficulty in predicting the shape and timing of an economic recovery, we have withdrawn the guidance we provided for EBITDA, CapEx and free cash flow.  
Slide 5 provides a summary of our response to the crisis. I'll start with the measures we put in place to support our employees and how they've been responding. From the beginning, we have been clear in our approach that the employees' safety is our #1 priority. Well ahead of government recommendations to adopt social distancing guidelines, we limited meeting sizes, eliminated travel and canceled company events. Ultimately, in early March, we transitioned the vast majority of our staff to work from home, halting the spread of the virus among our employees and the communities in which they live was our primary goal. We implemented an emergency paid time off program and extended short-term disability coverage to all U.S. employees to allow those directly touched by the virus greater flexibility and an increased sense of financial security. Protecting our essential employees, whether in the field or in our offices, was a special focus. Although now resolved, initially, we were challenged to meet the ever-changing recommendations for personal protective equipment. Our principal concern was protecting employees and customers during face-to-face interactions. As a further protected step, we accelerated the implementation of a customer self-service model, allowing a higher percentage of our customers to install and repair their own connections. But the main thing we did to protect our technicians was to reinforce that they had full authority to make their own safety decisions. If our technicians don't feel they can perform a specific task safely, they know they have the right to say no, with no second guessing of their decision. If you know anything about the culture and work ethic of the network tech community, you'll not be surprised to hear that these men and women have taken on the special challenges presented by this crisis with the same customer focus that has long been their hallmark.  
Finally, we've been clear with our employees that we will be very deliberate in our plans to return to our offices. That means returning to many of our locations will likely extend beyond government time lines. Frankly, I doubt we ever go back to the way things were before. As a manager, I was hesitant about embracing a distributed workforce, but the performance of our employees over the past 2 months has demonstrated that we can remain highly effective when working digitally from home. That performance allows us to be deliberate in our return and more broad minded about how we work together in the future. We will take our time and accelerate our own digital transformation as we look at the future of work within CenturyLink.  
As proud as I am of our employees, I'm equally proud of our customers' responses to the needs of their employees and customers and communities. Across both the public and private sectors, our customers have moved quickly to upgrade their digital infrastructure to enable distributed workforces and to meet the emergency needs of their communities. We have seen remarkable agility across our entire customer base from insurance companies to health care providers; from government agencies to financial services companies; from video and audio conferencing companies to individual consumers. We have been proud to support customers as diverse as the Social Security Administration, State Farm, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Hazelden Betty Ford clinic, Banner Engineering and M&T Tech, just to name a few.  
Our customers move quickly to increase capacity, deploy more robust VPN capabilities and add security services and for our consumer customers to establish or improve the connectivity required to adapt to what we now all appreciate to be the shocking reality of working from home and home schooling children. CenturyLink has taken broad steps to support these efforts, including some instances, turning up connectivity in a matter of hours and extensive capacity increases for our enterprise customers.  
COVID-19 will affect every aspect of our business, but I'm especially concerned about the financial health of our smallest business customers. These businesses form such a critical part of our local communities and they may lack the resources to weather disruptions of this magnitude. For small businesses with fewer than 50 employees and our consumer customers, we have currently suspended usage limits and committed not to disconnect or charge late fees. Recently, we extended our commitment to the SEC's Keep America Connected pledge through June. We will continue to assess how we can help support customers who need assistance to sustain themselves until the economy returns to more normal conditions.  
By working to support all of our customers as they work through their own challenges, our actions and performance reinforce that CenturyLink is a trusted partner. I've been inspired to see how our customers have met the demands of this crisis. We should all be encouraged that the commitment, energy and creativity seen in these responses will carry us forward as we begin to reopen the economy.  
We've also stepped up our community support efforts. We've donated bandwidth to frontline locations across our footprint, such as the USNS Mercy hospital ship in California and other temporary health care facilities across the country. We've established corporate and employee giving campaigns. We will continue to seek ways to support our communities. But we believe the most important relief we can provide is to continue to ensure our customers have the connectivity they need to respond to the demands of this crisis. The global pandemic has highlighted and accelerated the digital transformation we and our customers were already experiencing in how we live and work together. But over the past 2 months, we have seen a step function increase in the speed of those changes. I am very proud of our employees and our network's ability to meet that accelerated demand. 
Compared to typical traffic levels, we have seen 30% to 40% growth in Internet backbone traffic and a correspondingly, significant increase in average usage across our CDN, end user IT, voice and conferencing platforms. While the daily growth in traffic has leveled off over the last few weeks, usage remains high. Not all of that growth translates to revenue as contracts often include unlimited usage, but the overall increase in traffic is a positive leading indicator for us.  
The good news here is that the CenturyLink network was purpose-built as a platform of capabilities to handle the growing consumption of bandwidth that is brought about by digital transformation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. You've heard me talk about the benefits of fiber, it is faster, more secure and far more scalable than other infrastructures. Our network is built to flex in response to in the moment traffic increases. But when those increases begin to reach beyond the limits of our ability to flex, the robustness of our technology and the scope of our fiber and conduit infrastructure allows us to quickly and economically augment to handle the ever increasing demand, ensuring a great experience for our customers around the world.  
We are also seeing changes in the way we conduct business and an acceleration towards digital selling and customer care. However, I want to be clear, we do expect delays in decision-making from our business customers as they reassess their priorities and determine what the future of work looks like within their companies. We believe the critical nature of our services and the renewed importance of digital transformation means this will only be a pause and that our capabilities, close relationships with customers position us well for the economic recovery. 
We are watching our small business segment closely. While not yet seeing an increase in churn, this is an area of concern and attention. With our consumer customers, particularly in the early days, we received requests for speed upgrades, along with a rise in overall order volumes. This increased activity demonstrates something we've discussed before. Where we invest in fiber and providing higher speeds, we take share in the consumer market. Broadband is a utility you don't want to live without these days. However, given the rise in unemployment numbers, we are watching consumer churn carefully.  
The acceleration of digital transformation, driven by COVID-19 presents a wide range of opportunities for CenturyLink. Our far-reaching and powerful fiber network, together with services like embedded security, edge computing, IT enablement and managed services make us a key enabler of digital transformation across our economy. In fact, virtually all of our services have been designed for the digital economy. This crisis has reinforced the value of those services to our customers and our response has highlighted our ability to meet their evolving needs quickly and effectively. We believe all of this validates the value of our business going forward.  
At the same time, legacy communications spend will continue to decline, and we know we have to adapt to a lower cost, more customer-friendly digital support model to meet the demands of the future. Our response to this crisis has accelerated some of those plans. And later in the call, Neel will discuss our progress against our transformation efficiencies.  
The digital transformation is about far more than reducing cost. It is fundamentally about eliminating the barriers of distance and enhancing how people interact, both with each other and with the data that is relevant to their businesses and lines. We believe the current prices, along with the broader deployment of AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things, edge computing and the like, will accelerate the march toward digital transformation and that CenturyLink is well positioned to support and benefit.  
To be clear, we anticipate a negative effect on our near-term results. We have seen some increased demand, but our business is ultimately only as successful as the businesses of our customers. Nonetheless, we believe this crisis has highlighted that the services we offer are at the very heart of the digital economy. We are financially stable, investing in the capabilities our customers need, continuing to digitally transform our own customer interactions and facilitating and assisting our customers as they seek to realize the benefits from these ongoing technology trends.  
I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and our revised outlook for 2020. Neel?"

Before we get into the details of the quarter and a discussion of how COVID-19 is impacting the business, I'll provide a few high level remarks.  
First, our liquidity position is strong, and we are confident about our ability to manage through this crisis. As we navigate these uncertain times, we are pleased with the capital market actions we took over the last year to position the business for the long term. Although we could have never envisioned the pandemic, the current situation further underlines the resilience of our long-term approach to capital allocation. We are exiting the first quarter well positioned to continue investing in the business, delever and support our dividend policy.  
Second, we saw continued improvement in our overall revenue performance and expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. While we expect to see revenue pressure given COVID-19 and related economic forecast, we are fortunate to have a diverse revenue base by industry, geography and customer size.  
Third, the changes we've already seen in how we live, work and interact with each other highlight the importance of the services we offer and where we are investing. We believe this crisis validates our strategy and we are continuing to invest in these essential services in our operational and digital transformation. However, as we look at the remainder of the year, we do expect to see pressure on both revenue and the speed with which we continue to take costs out of the business as a result of COVID-19. With the current uncertainty, particularly as it relates to timing for an economic recovery, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures. Given our confidence in our liquidity position and focus on free cash flow, we have reaffirmed our deleveraging target and current dividend policy.  
Moving now to our first quarter results on Slide 6. I'll highlight a couple of things. We saw an improvement in our revenue trajectory this quarter and we made additional progress on our cost transformation initiatives. We are now at $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expanded margins by more than 100 basis points compared to the year ago quarter to 42.9%. We continue to improve our maturity profile and exited the quarter in a strong liquidity position.  
Turning to Slide 7. Our revenue is largely recurring from a well-diversified customer base, which will help us manage through this economic cycle. Although some of our customers will be highly impacted by the pandemic, we believe the connectivity services we provide are critical to their operations. The industries we expect to be highly impacted, as defined on this slide, represent about $1 billion in annualized revenue or approximately 5% of total revenue.  
As we look across the business, we believe the largest area of risk is the SMB business unit. So far, we haven't seen any significant lengthening of SMB receivables. As we consider the risk within the business unit, I'll note, on an annualized basis, approximately $250 million or less than 10% of revenue in our SMB channel are from highly impacted industries. In terms of customer size, customers with less than 50 employees represent approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenues.  
Turning to first quarter revenue results on Slide 8. On a year-over-year basis, for the first quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.7% to $5.2 billion compared to 5.1% in the first quarter of 2019. We have seen steady improvement in our revenue trajectory over the last few quarters. Sequentially, total revenue declined 1.5% compared to a decline of 2.2% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to Slide 9 and revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts or IGAM revenue was roughly flat and grew 1.3% on a constant currency basis. This compares to a decline of 4.7% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 0.6% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to a decline of 3.5% in the first quarter 2019.  
Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 0.4% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 2.1% in the first quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, enterprise declined 1% compared to a decline of 2.4% in the first quarter 2019, which is the typical seasonality we see in the first quarter of each year. In the short term for both IGAM and enterprise, we expect the demand impact from cancellation of live events and customers deferring major network buying decisions. However, the funnel remains strong and the theme from current customer conversations has been a delay of around 60 to 90 days, but with no fundamental change in long-term demand for our services. In fact, several of our customers are evaluating accelerating their own digital transformation, which we expect to be a benefit over the long term.  
SMB revenue decreased 6% year-over-year, in line with the average year-over-year decline of 6.5% in 2019, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we look at SMB for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier, this is an area of concern. We are working closely with these customers as they are critical, not only to CenturyLink, but the entire U.S. economy. Thus far, we have not seen a material change in churn, but we are closely monitoring the situation.  
It is also important to note that SMB is an opportunity for us, and we will continue to focus on increasing market share in our on-net buildings.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 7% year-over-year. This compares to a decline of 6.1% in the first quarter 2019. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 2.5% compared to a decline of 3.3% in the first quarter 2019. With respect to wholesale, just as we are doing, we expect customers in this segment will continue to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment, which may put pressure on revenue in the coming quarters. Additionally, as many of their enterprise customers defer buying decisions, we would expect to see the second order impact.  
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the first quarter 2019, revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by legacy voice revenue. Broadband revenue for the first quarter 2020 was flat year-over-year. We continue to focus on improving broadband revenue performance by our targeted fiber investments and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. In the first quarter, we saw a net loss of 11,000 total broadband subs in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 60,000 subs. From a consumer standpoint, as work-from-home began to ramp, we saw an immediate increase in new orders and requests for speed upgrades. Within the context of social distancing, our field technicians are doing a good job keeping up with order volumes.  
As we recover from COVID-19, we don't expect the pendulum to swing back all the way, positioning us well for the long term. At this point, we haven't seen a material increase in overall churn, accounts receivable or bad debt.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the first quarter 2020, the adjusted EBITDA was $2.243 billion compared to $2.262 billion in the first quarter 2019. We continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 42.9% compared to 41.7% in the year ago quarter. Despite a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately $200 million this quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable as we focused on cost transformation and profitable revenue growth.  
Regarding the COVID impact, we saw pluses and minuses during the first quarter. These items are hard to quantify, but we believe the net impact is a slight negative to first quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA, primarily driven by reduced activity in the last 2 to 3 weeks of March.  
In terms of bad debt expense, at the beginning of the year, we adopted ASC 326. At this time, we have not seen any changes to any of our metrics and cannot accurately predict with any certainty how the changing economic environment will impact our overall bad debt. We did not increase our bad debt reserves in the first quarter 2020. But we do expect to see an increase in bad debt, specifically in our SMB and consumer segments. And we'll have more to say on our second quarter earnings call.  
As of the end of the first quarter, we achieved approximately $510 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. However, social distancing and prioritization of other critical activities did impact the pace of our cost transformation efforts and are expected to continue to impact some of our initiatives in the near term. For example, we are experiencing delays in real estate site exits and off-net to on-net migrations as our customers are working from home or are focused on their own responses to COVID-19.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans. The opportunities have not changed and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. We expect to accelerate as the current situation improves. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the first quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $34 million and free cash flow by $82 million.  
For the first quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $974 million. This compares to first quarter 2019 CapEx of $931 million. We increased our CapEx spend as we prepare for the COVID-19 crisis by investing in inventory in the event of any supply chain disruption. However, to date, we have not seen disruptions for network equipment. Given the environment, we are going to be very measured in terms of how we spend capital. Generally speaking, our CapEx spending is success-based. Going forward, we are ensuring that capital spending is well aligned with sales and volume growth on the network. We may reduce spending in certain areas in the near term, such as buildings that are predominantly driven by SMB or other high-risk demand.  
We are continuing to invest through this uncertain time, primarily in long life assets, like fiber, where we see predictable returns.  
In the first quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $407 million. This compares to free cash flow of $315 million in the year ago quarter. This year, consistent with prior years, we saw higher use of cash in the first quarter due to higher working capital associated with annual bonus payments, prepayments on maintenance contracts and payroll taxes. The growth in free cash flow was driven by improvements in net cash interest and is a function of our deleveraging plans.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, we completed $10 billion in refinancings in January of this year. In addition, we completed over $90 million of open market purchases in March. And subsequent to the close of the quarter, we paid down $1 billion of debt at maturity.  
As you can see on Slide 13, we have very little in maturities in the near term.  
I wanted to take a moment and touch on our pension fund. At year-end 2019, the funded status of our pension was 86%. We generally report our pension funded status only on an annual basis. However, given current conditions, we are providing an update as of the end of the first quarter. Exiting the first quarter, our funding status was approximately 83%. We have significantly derisked the plan over the past 18 months and are pleased with our position, particularly given current market performance and volatility. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, there are no funding requirements in the near term.  
Let's now move to a discussion of our financial outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 14. The current situation brings several layers of uncertainty. It is hard to predict when the economy will recover or when enterprises will return to predictable buying patterns. Over the long term, our ability to work effectively with our customers is the primary indicator of growth. In the short term, we do believe the economy will affect the behavior of our customers. With that in mind, we do not believe that we are able to estimate the full year financial impact of COVID-19 with reasonable accuracy and are withdrawing our full year 2020 financial outlook for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and capital expenditures at this time. All other measures remain unchanged.  
To summarize, our revenue base is diversified and largely recurring. And the services we sell are essential to our customers. Given the tough decisions we made regarding capital allocation last year, we have the ability to invest in growth through this cycle. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. With respect to the dividend, we modeled multiple downside scenarios. And under all scenarios, we expect our payout ratio to remain in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow. As such, we remain comfortable with our dividend policy. Finally, we remain committed to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. However, it may take us a quarter or 2 longer than originally planned.  
Before I wrap up, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees, who have been performing extremely well during this pandemic. With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

So it's been really network upgrades, enabling their employees to work from home, increasing capacity into their data centers. So we're supporting all of those initiatives.  
In terms of new projects, broadly defined, I think the funnel is still strong and so the fundamental demand picture hasn't changed. The general conversation tone has been kind of a 60- to 90-day type delay. In SMB, we're still seeing sales but at lower levels than we did in March and we haven't seen any pickup for sure."

And maybe just a follow-up on SME. Do we have a sense of how many of your customers took the keep the client connected pledge and are nonpaying customers right now?"
260149,661943606,2016748,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 06, 2020",2020-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","So I'll start with your revenue pressure question, Batya.

But a couple of things to keep in mind. One is we're largely a recurring revenue business. And the services that we provide are really critical to the customers. So even if you think about SMB and you think about connectivity, a lot of the services we provide are supporting point of sale systems, security cameras, things like that, critical to their operations. So it's still early days. So if you think about cost reductions that these businesses have undertaken, has been around reducing headcount but the infrastructure is still in place. So the revenue is hard to tell. 
On the cost transformation side, the delays we've had are more around where social distancing is an issue. But as things tend to improve, we'll accelerate on our cost transformation. So we have a lot of levers there. But like you noted, in the near term, like Jeff emphasized, we have the financial flexibility to do the right things to support our customers, to provide things to support our employees. So we will have a financial impact in the near term. But we have a lot of levers by the time we get to free cash flow. And so we'll be managing costs tightly. We'll be calibrating our capital, although we'll be investing, we'll be calibrating our capital to demand and sales, and we feel pretty good at the free cash flow level. And like I mentioned, the models, the scenarios we've modeled, all of them are in the 30s in terms of dividend being as a percentage of free cash flow."

And I've gotten a number of e-mails from CEOs and department heads, thanking me for what we've been able to do in very short periods of time. 
And so we do -- there is a lot of uncertainty. But it's not long-term uncertainty, it's short term uncertainty. What does the shape of the recovery curve look like? When do we get started? And some of that affects our capital deployment and our cost savings. So for example, on capital, getting permits and hotel rooms for construction crews and that type of thing in our rural environment with CAF build-outs. If you look at our cost savings initiatives that are affected by this, things like converting off-net to on-net, our customers aren't in their offices. We can't convert them off-net to on-net when they're not there. And so until some of those things clear up, the visibility is a little bit hard. But there's nothing about this that has done anything other than reinforce that the products and services we have are exactly where our customers are headed and exactly what they need."

But it really is just can we get hotels in rural areas, can we get permits in urban areas. How do we continue to expand the footprint. We are continuing to expand the footprint in the first quarter for our enterprise customers. We continue to add buildings. I think we're somewhere around 4,500 buildings. That's probably something that we will slow down in the coming months as part of our looking and waiting and seeing what happens with small and medium enterprise customers. So we'll continue to pay close attention to it, but we didn't have any market performance declines in our ability to add buildings. 
From a consumer perspective, we are very serious about investing fiber to -- through our micro-targeting strategy that we've talked about before. And it's successful. We want to invest fiber where we can afford to do so. And wherever we invest fiber, we grow and we drive penetration out. And so we'll continue to do that. Overall, we're a fiber company. We've continued to invest capital to expand and augment the fiber network in more locations, take better use of edge computing, all of the different trends that we see in the market."

We're not necessarily leaning into it, but we will make sure that we look and stay abreast of all the different opportunities.  
I think we have time for one more question. No questions left, right? Well, let me do a quick wrap-up and close the call with a few key thoughts. While we're still in the early days and there are a lot of unknowns, one thing I feel certain is that the demand for fiber and for the services we provide are more important than ever. And I've said this a couple of times on the call, CenturyLink though, will also rise to the challenge to meet the customer needs. And we've seen that in spades over the last 2 months. So very pleased with how we've been performing. 
COVID-19 is accelerating the digital transformation efforts, both of ours and our customers. And so we'll continue to see our network-related services are critical to supporting those efforts. Our actions last year to shift our capital allocation strategy and focus capital on deleveraging and investing in the business to place CenturyLink in a strong financial position with ample liquidity, comfortable payout ratios and manageable maturities for the next few years. Even in the midst of so much uncertainty, we believe we're well positioned to weather the near-term financial impacts of COVID and to take advantage of the ongoing digital transformation to drive long-term growth in free cash flow per share. 
I normally end with a focus on our free cash flow per share. Today, I'll close by repeating what I said at the beginning of the call. I'm very proud of our employees and we will continue to keep their health and safety as our top priority. Thank you for joining today's call and for your interest in CenturyLink.

On today's call, I'll provide my thoughts on our second quarter results, the market demand we see for dynamic, robust fiber-based services that are at the heart of CenturyLink and how we continue to position the company to grow as we meet that demand. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter, and then we will open it up to your questions. 
I'll start with the solid results we delivered in the second quarter. Our team has done an incredible job of maintaining direct engagement with our enterprise customers. We've begun to see our customers adapt to the new normal of COVID-19 and resume their digital transformation efforts. They see that using next-generation technologies enable them to adapt their business models more rapidly and are working to take advantage of tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning across distributed compute resources and high-performance networking. This translates into greater demand for transport services, hybrid WAN connectivity, network-based security, edge computing and managed services as enterprises adjust to a more data-dependent and distributed operating environment. 
This new normal has also increased consumers' need for digital services, and the demand for data shows no signs of slowing. The economic effects of the pandemic create uncertainty for our customers, partners, the company and the market in general. But the pandemic has also highlighted the absolutely essential and durable nature of CenturyLink services and infrastructure in an all-digital world. Now more than ever, businesses realize that to thrive, they must acquire, analyze and act on data and deliver the digital applications and experiences that people need. 
As you can see on Slide 4, we own the critical infrastructure, everything from the extensive fiber network to the deep peering and interconnection relationships required to deliver customers' agile, scalable, secure network infrastructure that is easily and flexibly consumed. I'm proud of how responsive our employees have been to customers and how they have delivered with speed and urgency. This agility is key to our strategy and is underpinned by our ongoing transformation from a telecom service provider to a leading technology company, providing network and network-supported technology solutions to today's digital market. 
We all know how well positioned our infrastructure is, but our value proposition is more than having great infrastructure. I frequently talk to employees about how our relationships with customers must be rooted in CenturyLink's capabilities to drive their success rather than the mindset of speeds and feeds and circuits of a typical telecom company. As a technology company, we combine our deep infrastructure strength with a digital operating environment that enables our customers to turn their data and connectivity into a strategic advantage. We integrate network, compute and operational technologies with managed services to simplify their business operations. Capabilities like orchestration services help them control the thousands of widely distributed devices and digital assets they now have to manage. The COVID-19 crisis didn't create this need, but it has certainly amplified and accelerated it. And you can see this in our second quarter results with improving revenue trends, led by revenue growth in Enterprise, solid performance in iGAM on a constant currency basis and growth in consumer broadband. 
In the second quarter, in addition to improved revenue performance, we saw sequential and strong year-over-year growth in sales for both iGAM and Enterprise, somewhat offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and SMB. While SMB sales haven't been as robust as Enterprise and iGAM, SMB revenue results were in line with prior quarters, demonstrating the resilience and importance of our services to these customers even in the face of the pandemic. We continue to believe we have tremendous opportunity and have made changes in our leadership and go-to-market approach to improve our performance in this segment. In the coming months, you will see us expand our efforts to grow our small business customer base, delivering a broader digital experience in our more than 170,000 fiber-fed on-net buildings. 
Let me give you some color around our quarterly sales growth and funnel outlook by highlighting a couple of examples. As the pandemic hit the U.S. near the end of the first quarter, the priority for customers, like most of us, was to manage the crisis in front of them. Other than requirements for emergency connectivity, conversations about network expansions or future transformations understandably paused in the early days. But as customers have moved beyond the first wave of crisis response, we've seen a marked change in their engagement and increased urgency in their dialogue about longer-term digital transformation of their work environment and data platforms. It's a pivot we have noticed across our customer base, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of our sales funnel. 
These discussions are about more than just network. As I noted earlier, this is about using our technology platform to provide services in new and effective ways to meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, we recently announced a contract with the state of Arizona to provide network connectivity and managed IT services that will support all state government agencies and transform how the state delivers services to its citizens. CenturyLink had previously won an AZNET contract, the type of connectivity contract that telecom companies frequently win. But because of our full range of solutions, we were able to expand our relationship beyond the network to include critical capabilities such as cloud-based integrated security, automation and cloud orchestration. This is the CenturyLink of the future, a company that delivers digital technology solutions to our customers, differentiated through our world-class fiber infrastructure. 
If you consider the increasing demand across all customer verticals to move massive data set as quickly as possible to widely distributed processing resources our infrastructure is very well aligned to meet this shift in requirements. By combining just 100-or-so of our existing technical spaces with our deeply distributed fiber network, we can serve around 95% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. Further, as operators of one of the largest and most interconnected networks in the world, we enable our customers to efficiently and effectively collect, process and move their data seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, public data centers, company-owned data centers and the various work locations of the enterprise, whether in employees' homes or in the office. And I see examples of this in our business every day. 
Turning to Slide 7 for a few examples. One of our customers, a food manufacturing facility, relies on CenturyLink to host their robotics control application. We built wireless connectivity across the factory floor, collect manufacturing data and distribute it in real time to the manufacturer suppliers across the country. All of this is delivered over our network with CenturyLink providing network security for the entire stack of applications on our platform. 
Similarly, we support online gaming customers that require very low latency and great connectivity to end users. Our edge compute capabilities and our deep global Internet peering have made CenturyLink an excellent platform to meet their needs. As a final example, a large U.S. retailer leverages our edge platform to move extensive compute resources from each store to our secure edge compute facilities, relying on our extremely low latency fiber network for connectivity, reducing their cost and complexity, while also improving performance of their data processing solutions. One customer has estimated 25% to 30% operational savings as a result. 
Supporting the deployment of 5G networks is another source of demand that we've seen gain traction. We continue to partner with our wireless customers to provide the fiber to run their 5G networks. It's long been obvious the key to effective wireless services is an extensive fiber network and the breadth and depth of our fiber infrastructure supports our ability to meet these needs. We've seen a few wins, but the volume of request is beginning to increase, and we are ramping our own capabilities to support the nationwide deployment of 5G. The alignment of our fiber and other infrastructure assets, the evolving market needs and our team's exceptional execution resulted in a solid quarter for our Enterprise business. 
Turning to consumer. As I said before, where we invest, we will grow, and you can see that in the second quarter broadband revenue, which grew year-over-year and sequentially. We remain disciplined, continuing with our micro-targeting strategy and funding our expansion, while also focusing on better penetration in areas already served. Year-to-date, we've added more than 200,000 new homes passed to our fiber footprint and have approximately 2.2 million homes addressable today. 
During the quarter, we added 42,000 1 gig and above customers, a record for us since we began expanding our Fiber to the Home efforts. I recently read a social media post comparing CenturyLink gigabit services to those of one of our large, very capable cable competitors. The writer got it all right. Our price per bit was lower, the pricing was simpler, and the lack of congestion, better upstream speed and lower latency of our network was better than the alternative. Everything about the experience made CenturyLink a clear winner in this writer's analysis. 
While this was a blog on our consumer services, the same benefits extend to our small business customers. We've been clear that our principal strategic focus is our Enterprise business, but we also embrace the consumer opportunity, and are very encouraged by the returns we see in consumer and small business fiber deployments. 
We've all been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, both at home and at work. CenturyLink is no exception, and it certainly has changed how we think about work-from-home and the distributed workforce. What has not changed is our long-term strategy, our long-term focus on the customer or the time lines of our ongoing digital transformation efforts. 
I continue to be impressed by our team members, how they're managing through the pandemic to deliver for our customers. And we remain in the primarily work-from-home environment with roughly 75% of our employees working from home and 25% working from work. We are currently planning a broader return to the office, and we'll follow a phased approach and will be fact-based by location in our decision-making. While a few specific employees may return earlier, I've told employees not to expect to return to the office before early fall. Like many of our customers, the crisis has accelerated our digital transformation and changes to our staffing model. Frankly, I don't expect we will ever return to work for more approach we had prior to the pandemic. 
Finally, I'll touch on our capital allocation strategy. We believe we have the right balance in investing for growth, reducing leverage and returning more than $1 billion per year in dividends to shareholders. I believe the actions we have taken in the past have put us in a good position for weathering COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and we will continue following the objectives we've laid out for you. We continue investing in the business. We have reduced our leverage to 3.7x and have no significant near-term maturities, and our ability to support our dividend speaks for itself with a payout ratio in the 30s. However, I don't believe CenturyLink's current market valuation properly reflects where we are as a company. Although we certainly have legacy businesses, the depth and capabilities of our fiber network, the strong demand for our services across both enterprise and consumer segments, the ongoing efforts to transform and fundamentally change the nature and cost of our service delivery model, the strength of our balance sheet and our relatively low dividend payout ratio makes us excited about our opportunities to transform and grow our business. Our focus is to drive toward that reality. 
In summary, we are pleased with the continued improvement in our revenue trajectory and the positive effects of our transformation into a technology company focused on building a platform for critical digital services. While the ongoing pandemic and economic environment creates near-term uncertainty, we believe our solutions and approach to the market are enabling our success and position us well for long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers embrace the fourth industrial revolution and digitally transform their businesses. With that, I'll turn it over to Neel to discuss our financial results."

We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. We have seen steady improvement in total revenue performance over the last 5 quarters, primarily driven by Enterprise, iGAM and our consumer broadband business. We also had strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in our Enterprise segment. We saw continued progress on cost transformation initiatives achieving $110 million of incremental annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings during the quarter and delivered solid EBITDA and free cash flow, especially with higher COVID-related expenses and inefficiencies related to operating in the current environment. 
We made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives and pleased with our resulting interest cost savings. We also continued to lean in to capital spending during the quarter, driven by customer upgrades and supported by strong leading indicators. The connectivity services we provide are critical, and our revenue is largely recurring and highly diversified. Our second quarter results highlight that our business is resilient. 
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, for the second quarter of 2020, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.2 billion compared to a decline of 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.7%. On our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that about $1 billion or 5% of our annualized total revenues are from highly impacted industries. We did not a material change this quarter. 
Moving to Slide 9, in revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or iGAM, revenue declined 3.2% and declined 0.7% on a constant currency basis. On a sequential basis, iGAM declined 1.8% and was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. 
In addition to currency headwinds, our international business across Europe, Latin America and Asia experienced reduced levels of activity from COVID-related shutdowns. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 1.7%. This compares to a decline of 1.8% in the second quarter 2019. The on a sequential basis, Enterprise grew about 1%. During the quarter, we upgraded the network infrastructure for several customers and saw strength in collaboration and related services. We see that customers are buying again, mostly focused on their immediate needs as they operate in the current environment. As Jeff mentioned, both iGAM and Enterprise sales orders grew year-over-year. Our sales teams continue to have good discussions with customers, indicating an acceleration of their digital strategies. We are cautiously optimistic and encouraged by the leading indicators for both Enterprise and iGAM. 
SMB revenue decreased 6.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. This compares to an average decline of 7.1% over the last 4 quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, the current situation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we are monitoring and working closely with our customers. We also noted that SMB had exposure to highly impacted industries of less than 10%, with approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenue from customers with less than 50 employees. This dynamic is largely unchanged in the second quarter. 
Over the long term, we believe SMB represents a growth opportunity for us. We continue to invest in our product capabilities and customer experience improvement initiatives. It's a large addressable market and expect customer propensity to switch and our traction to increase when businesses return. 
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.3% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7.5% over the last 4 quarters. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1%. With respect to wholesale, we continue to expect these customers to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing some traction with carriers as they invest in 5G. 
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2020, revenue declined 5.3% year-over-year compared to 8.1% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.8%, primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice revenue declines, offset by growth in broadband. Broadband revenue now represents 55% of our consumer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter 2019. Go forward performance will be largely driven by our execution around our Fiber to the Home investment strategy and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. Broadband revenue for the second quarter 2020 grew 1.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, broadband grew 0.6%. In the second quarter, we saw a net loss of 29,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 68,000 subs. Our customers that are participating in the Keep Americans Connected pledge have been subtracted from the sub numbers that I just mentioned. I'll also note that besides our investments in Fiber to the Home, we are also investing in self-service capabilities as part of our digital transformation efforts. In addition to a better customer experience, these capabilities are a key component of our cost transformation plan. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the second quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.174 billion compared to $2.269 billion in the second quarter 2019 and $2.243 billion in the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, we increased our bad debt expense by $25 million against accounts receivable due to the possible and expected economic implications of the pandemic. We also incurred higher expenses such as overtime as we work to install expedited services for customers. In addition, we experienced some timing delays for cost transformation initiatives early in the quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.9% compared to 42.2% in the year ago quarter. As you think about sequential EBITDA performance, keep in mind that COVID only impacted our first quarter results by 2 or 3 weeks versus a full quarter global impact in the second quarter. 
As of the end of the second quarter, we achieved approximately $620 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $510 million as of the end of the first quarter 2020. As we indicated last quarter, we saw some challenges early in the second quarter. But as the economy reopened, we gained good traction, and we were pleased with the run rate savings we achieved as we exited the quarter. 
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the second quarter of 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $89 million and free cash flow by $63 million. 
For the second quarter of 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion. This compares to second quarter 2019 CapEx of $800 million. During the quarter, we augmented capacity for our customers and supported higher traffic on the network. We are leaning in and continuing to invest in our customers, our capabilities, and long-life fiber infrastructure assets. 
In the second quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $803 million, this compares to free cash flow of $956 million in the second quarter 2019. The year-over-year change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, offset by lower interest expenses. Given our cash flow profile, as I just mentioned, we are investing in the business, supported by positive demand drivers and leading indicators. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. Since announcing our 3-year plan to delever to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, we have reduced net debt by $2.5 billion. During the second quarter, we paid down $500 million in debt obligations and refinanced $1.2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $18 billion over the past 12 months and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $14 billion. 
Turning to Slide 13. We are lowering our GAAP interest expense to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion. We are also updating our cash interest expense to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion from our previous range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of guidance represents a savings of about $450 million relative to 2018 cash interest expense. The reduction is driven by our deleveraging and refinancing activities, coupled with a low interest rate environment. 
To summarize, our results highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. Our customers are accelerating their digital strategies, our sales funnel is improving, and we're cautiously optimistic about the demand drivers, our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year, investing in the business to improve revenue trajectory, returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend with a payout ratio expected in the 30s, and deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25. With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

And so therefore, we didn't feel, at this point of time, it was appropriate to reinstate guidance as such. But the overall indicators are still positive. 
In terms of free cash flow, we still feel good about our payout being in the 30s. If you think about the dividend as a percentage of free cash flow. And so that gives you some sense that we feel that our free cash flow is going to be fairly resilient even in this environment."

And so we're going to continue to focus on that. You've seen what we've done over the last couple of years in improving our EBITDA performance and making sure that we're investing and providing a great customer experience. 
And so when I think about the market valuation being wrong, I look at the business that we are. And I think that we're a very strong company, offering exactly what our customers need with -- that they're going to need in the future. It's not just what they need today, but it's also what they need tomorrow. And so we'll continue to focus on executing against that business plan. And then we're always open, and I've said this a number of times, but actively consider, are there other ways for us to release the value within CenturyLink.

So if you think about the strength we saw in voice and collaboration, you mentioned, that exactly is the point, that you need a lot more connectivity for a higher level of collaboration. So we did see request for a lot of upgrades that helped the quarter. 
We did see strength in collaboration. Over time, customers may meet those needs in different ways, but the key point from our perspective is that we have a broad range of products. And even if, going forward, the customers used to meet that same collaboration need in a different way, we have the products to support that need. 
Yes. In terms of higher expenses, $25 million for bad debt. We also had over -- a fair amount of overtime during the quarter for installing expedited services. And as you can imagine, in this environment, with all the physical constraints, we're not exactly operating in the most efficient way. So I would say there's probably in the low tens of millions of additional cost embedded in the organization operating in this environment."

You can look at every major data center, you can look at public clouds and private clouds and eyeball networks, we operate a very deeply interconnected network, and that's a competitive advantage. 
With respect to SD-WAN, is it growing? Or not growing? Or VPN? We think that there is a great opportunity for hybrid WAN. This is not an SD-WAN solution, it's not a VPN solution. It's a hybrid WAN solution, and we're continuing to work with our customers to roll out those capabilities and a more distributed workforce, a more distributed operating environment feeds into that hybrid WAN capability as well."

And I know that kind of talking to your peers, installations and turning bookings into billings was a question mark over the whole quarter. If you could kind of address how you see that book-to-bill relationship in second quarter and how you see it evolving into the third quarter? 
And then I guess, Jeff, just -- you kind of mentioned this idea of kind of work from work is definitely changing forever, and I agree with that. You've got an $800 million to $1 billion kind of cost-cutting target.

I don't know if they said about service delivery. I'm very confident in our service delivery. Our team has done a great job through this. I think on the second quarter call, I made a comment either in the prepared remarks or in the questions about customers putting things on hold, that they're going into the COVID pandemic and they were concerned and basically said, ""Don't mess with the network, don't touch it. Let's focus on operating, while we figure this out."" So things went on hold. We call that long-term customer hold. That has continued to reduce. What we've seen is post that crisis response is our customers not getting back to normal, but moving back that direction. And so we don't see the long-term customer hold. I think our service delivery team is second to none, and they haven't created -- we don't have any particular bottlenecks. They're doing a really good job of turning up capabilities. And so that book-to-bill process for us is pretty typical. Now we do still have some long-term customer hold because not everybody has stopped. But I wouldn't have called it out this quarter as an issue like I might have last quarter. 
On the second issue and from work for work and have we estimated for our own transformation? Are there -- what does that mean from a cost savings perspective? We are quite looking at it that way. We look at our transition back-to-work, and we step back from what does the transition look like? And we say, what is work of the future look like? How do we want to do business in CenturyLink? And where do we think it's best and optimized to do so. And so right now, we're in the middle of that effort to make sure that we look at what the future of work within CenturyLink looks like, what mix of it should be done in the office, what mix of it should be done remotely, how do we think about that, how do we think about the jobs, did the jobs change, as the products and services are evolving. And so our transformation efforts are really longer-term looking at how do we think about the business going forward. And we haven't looked right now and said, ""Well, should we change any of our expectations on the existing targets that we put out there?"" We basically said, what are we trying to build as a company? What's the best way to do that? And then how do we transition to that as we move back from a work-from-home environment? 
Now my color in the prepared remarks, so basically, just to say, I don't expect to go back to the way it was. And I don't expect our customers to go back to the way it was. And I frankly think that's good for CenturyLink overall, as we look to support our business and we look to support our customers."

And like you've seen, we're investing in the business, and the rest of it is going to the dividend. And our dividend is right now at about $1.1 billion of cash. 
In terms of your returns, not -- they vary. But in general, I would say, there's a couple of things. One, the returns we see aren't good because we have a micro-targeting approach, as you've heard Jeff talk about in numerous occasions, we don't really go out and build an entire city. We really go pick the neighborhoods where we can get high returns because it's a function of population density or home density and the cost to build. So typically, aerial plan. So things that we're building right now are very high return."

On today's call, I'll provide my thoughts on our second quarter results, the market demand we see for dynamic, robust fiber-based services that are at the heart of CenturyLink and how we continue to position the company to grow as we meet that demand. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter, and then we will open it up to your questions.  
I'll start with the solid results we delivered in the second quarter. Our team has done an incredible job of maintaining direct engagement with our enterprise customers. We've begun to see our customers adapt to the new normal of COVID-19 and resume their digital transformation efforts. They see that using next-generation technologies enable them to adapt their business models more rapidly and are working to take advantage of tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning across distributed compute resources and high-performance networking. This translates into greater demand for transport services, hybrid WAN connectivity, network-based security, edge computing and managed services as enterprises adjust to a more data-dependent and distributed operating environment.  
This new normal has also increased consumers' need for digital services, and the demand for data shows no signs of slowing. The economic effects of the pandemic create uncertainty for our customers, partners, the company and the market in general. But the pandemic has also highlighted the absolutely essential and durable nature of CenturyLink services and infrastructure in an all-digital world. Now more than ever, businesses realize that to thrive, they must acquire, analyze and act on data and deliver the digital applications and experiences that people need.  
As you can see on Slide 4, we own the critical infrastructure, everything from the extensive fiber network to the deep peering and interconnection relationships required to deliver customers' agile, scalable, secure network infrastructure that is easily and flexibly consumed. 
I'm proud of how responsive our employees have been to customers and how they have delivered with speed and urgency. This agility is key to our strategy and is underpinned by our ongoing transformation from a telecom service provider to a leading technology company, providing network and network-supported technology solutions to today's digital market.  
We all know how well positioned our infrastructure is, but our value proposition is more than having great infrastructure. I frequently talk to employees about how our relationships with customers must be rooted in CenturyLink's capabilities to drive their success rather than the mindset of speeds and feeds and circuits of a typical telecom company. As a technology company, we combine our deep infrastructure strength with a digital operating environment that enables our customers to turn their data and connectivity into a strategic advantage. We integrate network, compute and operational technologies with managed services to simplify their business operation. Capabilities like orchestration services help them control the thousands of widely-distributed devices and digital assets they now have to manage. 
The COVID-19 crisis didn't create this need, but it has certainly amplified and accelerated it. And you can see this in our second quarter results with improving revenue trends, led by revenue growth in Enterprise, solid performance in IGAM on a constant currency basis and growth in consumer broadband.  
In the second quarter, in addition to improved revenue performance, we saw sequential and strong year-over-year growth in sales for both IGAM and Enterprise, somewhat offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and SMB.
While SMB sales haven't been as robust as Enterprise and IGAM, SMB revenue results were in line with prior quarters, demonstrating the resilience and importance of our services to these customers even in the face of the pandemic. We continue to believe we have tremendous opportunity and have made changes in our leadership and go-to-market approach to improve our performance in this segment. 
In the coming months, you will see us expand our efforts to grow our small business customer base, delivering a broader digital experience in our more than 170,000 fiber-fed on-net buildings.
Let me give you some color around our quarterly sales growth and funnel outlook by highlighting a couple of examples. As the pandemic hit the U.S. near the end of the first quarter, the priority for customers, like most of us, was to manage the crisis in front of them. Other than requirements for emergency connectivity, conversations about network expansions or future transformations understandably paused in the early days. 
But as customers have moved beyond the first wave of crisis response, we've seen a marked change in their engagement and increased urgency in their dialogue about longer-term digital transformation of their work environment and data platforms. It's a pivot we have noticed across our customer base, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of our sales funnel.  
These discussions are about more than just network. As I noted earlier, this is about using our technology platform to provide services in new and effective ways to meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, we recently announced a contract with the State of Arizona to provide network connectivity and managed IT services that will support all state government agencies and transform how the state delivers services to its citizens. 
CenturyLink had previously won an AZNet contract, the type of connectivity contract that telecom companies frequently win. But because of our full range of solutions, we were able to expand our relationship beyond the network to include critical capabilities such as cloud-based integrated security, automation and cloud orchestration. This is the CenturyLink of the future, a company that delivers digital technology solutions to our customers, differentiated through our world-class fiber infrastructure.  
If you consider the increasing demand across all customer verticals to move massive data sets as quickly as possible to widely distributed processing resources, our infrastructure is very well aligned to meet this shift in requirements. By combining just 100-or-so of our existing technical spaces with our deeply distributed fiber network, we can serve around 95% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. 
Further, as operators of one of the largest and most interconnected networks in the world, we enable our customers to efficiently and effectively collect, process and move their data seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, public data centers, company-owned data centers and the various work locations of the enterprise, whether in employees' homes or in the office. And I see examples of this in our business every day.  
Turning to Slide 7 for a few examples. One of our customers, a food manufacturing facility, relies on CenturyLink to host their robotics control application. We built wireless connectivity across the factory floor, collect manufacturing data and distribute it in real time to the manufacturer suppliers across the country. All of this is delivered over our network with CenturyLink providing network security for the entire stack of applications on our platform.  
Similarly, we support online gaming customers that require very low latency and great connectivity to end users. Our edge compute capabilities and our deep global Internet peering have made CenturyLink an excellent platform to meet their needs. 
As a final example, a large U.S. retailer leverages our edge platform to move extensive compute resources from each store to our secure edge compute facilities, relying on our extremely low latency fiber network for connectivity, reducing their cost and complexity, while also improving performance of their data processing solutions. One customer has estimated 25% to 30% operational savings as a result.  
Supporting the deployment of 5G networks is another source of demand that we've seen gain traction. We continue to partner with our wireless customers to provide the fiber to run their 5G networks. It's long been obvious the key to effective wireless services is an extensive fiber network and the breadth and depth of our fiber infrastructure supports our ability to meet these needs. We've seen a few wins, but the volume of request is beginning to increase, and we are ramping our own capabilities to support the nationwide deployment to 5G. The alignment of our fiber and other infrastructure assets, the evolving market needs and our team's exceptional execution resulted in a solid quarter for our Enterprise business.  
Turning to consumer. As I said before, where we invest, we will grow, and you can see that in the second quarter broadband revenue, which grew year-over-year and sequentially. We remain disciplined, continuing with our micro-targeting strategy and funding our expansion, while also focusing on better penetration in areas already served. Year-to-date, we've added more than 200,000 new homes patched to our fiber footprint and have approximately 2.2 million homes addressable today.  
During the quarter, we added 42,000 1 gig and above customers, a record for us since we began expanding our Fiber to the Home efforts. I recently read a social media post comparing CenturyLink gigabit services to those of one of our large, very capable cable competitors. The writer got it all right. Our price per bit was lower, the pricing was simpler, and the lack of congestion, better upstream speed and lower latency of our network was better than the cable alternative. Everything about the experience made CenturyLink a clear winner in this writer's analysis.  
While this was a blog on our consumer services, the same benefits extend to our small business customers. We've been clear that our principal strategic focus is our Enterprise business, but we also embrace the consumer opportunity, and are very encouraged by the returns we see in consumer and small business fiber deployments.  
We've all been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, both at home and at work. CenturyLink is no exception, and it certainly has changed how we think about work-from-home and the distributed workforce. What has not changed is our long-term strategy, our long-term focus on the customer or the time lines of our ongoing digital transformation efforts.  
I continue to be impressed by our team members, how they're managing through the pandemic to deliver for our customers. And we remain in the primarily work-from-home environment with roughly 75% of our employees working from home and 25% working from work. We are currently planning a broader return to the office, and we'll follow a phased approach and will be fact-based by location in our decision-making. 
While a few specific employees may return earlier, I've told employees not to expect to return to the office before early fall. Like many of our customers, the crisis has accelerated our digital transformation and changes to our staffing model. Frankly, I don't expect we will ever return to work-from-work approach we had prior to the pandemic. 
Finally, I'll touch on our capital allocation strategy. We believe we have the right balance in investing for growth, reducing leverage and returning more than $1 billion per year in dividends to shareholders. I believe the actions we have taken in the past have put us in a good position for weathering COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and we will continue following the objectives we've laid out for you. We continue investing in the business. We have reduced our leverage to 3.7x and have no significant near-term maturities, and our ability to support our dividend speaks for itself with a payout ratio in the 30s. 
However, I don't believe CenturyLink's current market valuation properly reflects where we are as a company. Although we certainly have legacy businesses, the depth and capabilities of our fiber network, the strong demand for our services across both enterprise and consumer segments, the ongoing efforts to transform and fundamentally change the nature and cost of our service delivery model, the strength of our balance sheet and our relatively low dividend payout ratio makes us excited about our opportunities to transform and grow our business. Our focus is to drive toward that reality.  
In summary, we are pleased with the continued improvement in our revenue trajectory and the positive effects of our transformation into a technology company focused on building a platform for critical digital services. While the ongoing pandemic and economic environment creates near-term uncertainty, we believe our solutions and approach to the market are enabling our success and position us well for long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers embrace the fourth industrial revolution and digitally transform their businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Neel to discuss our financial results."
260149,676142489,2061699,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. We have seen steady improvement in total re",1482,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. 
We have seen steady improvement in total revenue performance over the last 5 quarters, primarily driven by Enterprise, IGAM and our consumer broadband business. We also had strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in our Enterprise segment. We saw continued progress on cost transformation initiatives achieving $110 million of incremental annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings during the quarter and delivered solid EBITDA and free cash flow, especially with higher COVID-related expenses and inefficiencies related to operating in the current environment. 
We made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives and pleased with our resulting interest cost savings. We also continued to lean in to capital spending during the quarter, driven by customer upgrades and supported by strong leading indicators. The connectivity services we provide are critical, and our revenue is largely recurring and highly diversified. Our second quarter results highlight that our business is resilient.  
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, for the second quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.2 billion, compared to a decline of 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.7%. On our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that about $1 billion or 5% of our annualized total revenues are from highly impacted industries. We did not see a material change this quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, in revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM, revenue declined 3.2% and declined 0.7% on a constant currency basis. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 1.8% and was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. In addition to currency headwinds, our international business across Europe, Latin America and Asia experienced reduced levels of activity from COVID-related shutdowns. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 1.7%. This compares to a decline of 1.8% in the second quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew about 1%. During the quarter, we upgraded the network infrastructure for several customers and saw strength in collaboration and related services. 
We see that customers are buying again, mostly focused on their immediate needs as they operate in the current environment. As Jeff mentioned, both IGAM and Enterprise sales orders grew year-over-year. Our sales teams continue to have good discussions with customers, indicating an acceleration of their digital strategies. We are cautiously optimistic and encouraged by the leading indicators for both Enterprise and IGAM.
SMB revenue decreased 6.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. This compares to an average decline of 7.1% over the last 4 quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, the current situation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we are monitoring and working closely with our customers. 
We also noted that SMB had exposure to highly-impacted industries of less than 10%, with approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenue from customers with less than 50 employees. This dynamic is largely unchanged in the second quarter.
Over the long term, we believe SMB represents a growth opportunity for us. We continue to invest in our product capabilities and customer experience improvement initiatives. It's a large addressable market and expect customer propensity to switch and our traction to increase when businesses return.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.3% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7.5% over the last 4 quarters. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1%. With respect to wholesale, we continue to expect these customers to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing some traction with carriers as they invest in 5G.
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2020, revenue declined 5.3% year-over-year compared to 8.1% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.8%, primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice revenue declines, offset by growth in broadband. 
Broadband revenue now represents 55% of our consumer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter 2019. Go forward performance will be largely driven by our execution around our Fiber to the Home investment strategy and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. Broadband revenue for the second quarter 2020 grew 1.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, broadband grew 0.6%. In the second quarter, we saw a net loss of 29,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 68,000 subs. Our customers that are participating in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge have been subtracted from the sub numbers that I just mentioned. 
I'll also note that besides our investments in Fiber to the Home, we are also investing in self-service capabilities as part of our digital transformation efforts. In addition to a better customer experience, these capabilities are a key component of our cost transformation plan.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the second quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.174 billion compared to $2.269 billion in the second quarter 2019 and $2.243 billion in the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, we increased our bad debt expense by $25 million against accounts receivable due to the possible and expected economic implications of the pandemic. We also incurred higher expenses such as overtime as we work to install expedited services for customers. In addition, we experienced some timing delays for cost transformation initiatives early in the quarter.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.9% compared to 42.2% in the year ago quarter. As you think about sequential EBITDA performance, keep in mind that COVID only impacted our first quarter results by 2 or 3 weeks versus a full quarter global impact in the second quarter.  
As of the end of the second quarter, we achieved approximately $620 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $510 million as of the end of the first quarter 2020. As we indicated last quarter, we saw some challenges early in the second quarter. But as the economy reopened, we gained good traction, and we were pleased with the run rate savings we achieved as we exited the quarter.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the second quarter 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $89 million and free cash flow by $63 million.  
For the second quarter 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion. This compares to second quarter 2019 CapEx of $800 million. During the quarter, we augmented capacity for our customers and supported higher traffic on the network. We are leaning in, in continuing to invest in our customers, our capabilities, and long-life fiber infrastructure assets.  
In the second quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $803 million, this compares to free cash flow of $956 million in the second quarter 2019. The year-over-year change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, offset by lower interest expenses. Given our cash flow profile, as I just mentioned, we are investing in the business, supported by positive demand drivers and leading indicators.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. Since announcing our 3-year plan to delever to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, we have reduced net debt by $2.5 billion. During the second quarter, we paid down $500 million in debt obligations and refinanced $1.2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $18 billion over the past 12 months and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $14 billion.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are lowering our GAAP interest expense to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion. We are also updating our cash interest expense to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion from our previous range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of guidance represents a savings of about $450 million relative to 2018 cash interest expense. The reduction is driven by our deleveraging and refinancing activities, coupled with a low interest rate environment.  
To summarize, our results highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. Our customers are accelerating their digital strategies. Our sales funnel is improving, and we're cautiously optimistic about the demand drivers. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year, investing in the business to improve revenue trajectory, returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend, with a payout ratio expected in the 30s and deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. Franz, will you please explain the process?"

But the overall indicators are still positive.  
In terms of free cash flow, we still feel good about our payout being in the 30s. If you think about the dividend as a percentage of free cash flow. And so that gives you some sense that we feel that our free cash flow is going to be fairly resilient even in this environment."

We're focused on investing in growth, and you see what we've done with respect to revenue and sales in the second quarter for IGAM and Enterprise and consumer broadband. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. 
You've seen what we've done over the last couple of years in improving our EBITDA performance and making sure that we're investing and providing a great customer experience. And so when I think about the market valuation being wrong, I look at the business that we are. And I think that we're a very strong company, offering exactly what our customers need with -- that they're going to need in the future. It's not just what they need today, but it's also what they need tomorrow. And so we'll continue to focus on executing against that business plan. 
And then we're always open, and I've said this a number of times, but actively consider, are there other ways for us to release the value within CenturyLink. So we'll continue to focus on that, but primarily focused on us growing our business with our customers, investing in our growth and returning a good dividend to our shareholders."

So if you think about the strength we saw in voice and collaboration, you mentioned, that exactly is the point, that you need a lot more connectivity for a higher level of collaboration. So we did see request for a lot of upgrades that helped the quarter.  
We did see strength in collaboration. Over time, customers may meet those needs in different ways, but the key point from our perspective is that we have a broad range of products. And even if, going forward, the customers choose to meet that same collaboration need in a different way, we have the products to support that need.  
In terms of higher expenses, $25 million for bad debt. We also had over -- a fair amount of overtime during the quarter for installing expedited services. And as you can imagine, in this environment, with all the physical constraints, we're not exactly operating in the most efficient way. So I would say there's probably in the low tens of millions of additional cost embedded in the organization operating in this environment."

But to your broader question, I think we are taking a closer look in terms of how we serve the really small end of small business. And that you're right, it's more aligned to consumer. And then more of the mid-market is more aligned to our enterprise strategy."

Does that have the long-term impact on the Enterprise business? 
And then I guess, secondly, you mentioned the technology transformation, which I guess shouldn't surprise any of us.

Fewer office locations? I do think they'll become more distributed. I do think that they will recognize that they need to locate their compute resources in different places, some in the public cloud, some in private data centers, some in our edge compute facilities, but they'll do that based on the application and the performance that they're looking out at out of that application and the network to provide it.
So I do think it will become more widely distributed. What does that mean for our Enterprise business? I think it means good things because our Enterprise business is focused on making sure that we deliver network and network-supported technologies to our customers to support that hybrid networking topology and making sure that we're matching our capabilities to the type of application they have.  
The thing that's most important is connectivity and bandwidth and latency. And so we will -- it will give us opportunities to make sure that we have more places to go to, more ways to use our deeply interconnected network. You can look at every major data center, you can look at public clouds and private clouds and eyeball networks. We operate a very deeply interconnected network, and that's a competitive advantage.  
With respect to SD-WAN, is it growing? Or not growing or VPNs? We think that there is a great opportunity for hybrid WAN. This is not an SD-WAN solution. It's not a VPN solution. It's a hybrid WAN solution, and we're continuing to work with our customers to roll out those capabilities and a more distributed workforce, a more distributed operating environment feeds into that hybrid WAN capability as well."

But the rest of the business is kind of in line. And I know that kind of talking to your peers, installations and turning bookings into billings was a question mark over the whole quarter. If you could kind of address how you see that book-to-bill relationship in second quarter and how you see it evolving into the third quarter?  
And then I guess, Jeff, just -- you kind of mentioned this idea of kind of work from work is definitely changing forever, and I agree with that. You've got an $800 million to $1 billion kind of cost-cutting target. Have you had an opportunity to kind of sit down and think about how that evolves in terms of magnitude for the business going forward?"

I don't know if they said about service delivery. I'm very confident in our service delivery. Our team has done a great job through this. I think on the second quarter call, I made a comment either in the prepared remarks or in the questions, about customers putting things on hold, that they're going into the COVID pandemic and they were concerned and basically said, ""Don't mess with the network. Don't touch it. Let's focus on operating, while we figure this out."" 
So things went on hold. We call that long-term customer hold. That has continued to reduce. What we've seen is post that crisis response is our customers not getting back to normal, but moving back that direction. And so we don't see the long-term customer hold. I think our service delivery team is second to none, and they haven't created -- we don't have any particular bottlenecks. They're doing a really good job of turning up capabilities. And so that book-to-bill process for us is pretty typical. 
Now we do still have some long-term customer hold because not everybody has stopped. But I wouldn't have called it out this quarter as an issue like I might have last quarter.  
On the second issue and from work for work and have we estimated for our own transformation? Are there -- what's that mean from a cost savings perspective? We are quite looking at it that way. We look at our transition back-to-work, and we step back from what does the transition look like? And we say, what is work of the future look like? How do we want to do business in CenturyLink? And where do we think it's best and optimized to do so? 
And so right now, we're in the middle of that effort to make sure that we look at what the future of work within CenturyLink looks like, what mix of it should be done in the office, what mix of it should be done remotely, how do we think about that, how do we think about the jobs, did the jobs change as the products and services are evolving? 
And so our transformation efforts are really longer-term looking at how do we think about the business going forward. And we haven't looked right now and said, ""Well, should we change any of our expectations on the existing targets that we put out there?"" We basically said, what are we trying to build as a company? What's the best way to do that? And then how do we transition to that as we move back from a work-from-home environment?  
Now my color in the prepared remarks, so basically, just to say, I don't expect to go back to the way it was. And I don't expect our customers to go back to the way it was. And I frankly think that's good for CenturyLink overall, as we look to support our business and we look to support our customers."

And like you've seen, we're investing in the business, and then the rest of it is going to the dividend. And our dividend is, right now, at about $1.1 billion of cash.  
In terms of your returns, not -- they vary. But in general, I would say, there's a couple of things. One, the returns we see are good because we have a micro-targeting approach, as you've heard Jeff talk about in numerous occasions. We don't really go out and build an entire city. We really go pick the neighborhoods where we can get high returns because it's a function of population density or home density and the cost to build. 
So typically, aerial plan. So things that we're building right now are very high return."

So a big part of the digital transformation is new opportunities for us as our customers are adapting to virtual reality and augmented reality and really the fourth industrial revolution. And so that's good opportunity for us. 
There are certainly products that are declining, and we see that, and we'll continue to see that. But I don't think that -- and there are aspects of our -- helping our customers evolve in digital transformation that could affect those products. But my goal is not only to help CenturyLink -- existing CenturyLink customers go out and transform digitally, but it's my goal to go out and get other companies' customers to digitally transform.

I'll start with the solid results we delivered in the second quarter. Our team has done an incredible job of maintaining direct engagement with our enterprise customers. We've begun to see our customers adapt to the new normal of COVID-19 and resume their digital transformation efforts. They see that using next-generation technologies enable them to adapt their business models more rapidly and are working to take advantage of tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning across distributed compute resources and high-performance networking. This translates into greater demand for transport services, hybrid WAN connectivity, network-based security, edge computing and managed services as enterprises adjust to a more data-dependent and distributed operating environment.  
This new normal has also increased consumers' need for digital services, and the demand for data shows no signs of slowing. The economic effects of the pandemic create uncertainty for our customers, partners, the company and the market in general. But the pandemic has also highlighted the absolutely essential and durable nature of CenturyLink services and infrastructure in an all-digital world. Now more than ever, businesses realize that to thrive, they must acquire, analyze and act on data and deliver the digital applications and experiences that people need.  
As you can see on Slide 4, we own the critical infrastructure, everything from the extensive fiber network to the deep peering and interconnection relationships required to deliver customers' agile, scalable, secure network infrastructure that is easily and flexibly consumed. 
I'm proud of how responsive our employees have been to customers and how they have delivered with speed and urgency. This agility is key to our strategy and is underpinned by our ongoing transformation from a telecom service provider to a leading technology company, providing network and network-supported technology solutions to today's digital market.  
We all know how well positioned our infrastructure is, but our value proposition is more than having great infrastructure. I frequently talk to employees about how our relationships with customers must be rooted in CenturyLink's capabilities to drive their success rather than the mindset of speeds and feeds and circuits of a typical telecom company. As a technology company, we combine our deep infrastructure strength with a digital operating environment that enables our customers to turn their data and connectivity into a strategic advantage. We integrate network, compute and operational technologies with managed services to simplify their business operation. Capabilities like orchestration services help them control the thousands of widely-distributed devices and digital assets they now have to manage. 
The COVID-19 crisis didn't create this need, but it has certainly amplified and accelerated it. And you can see this in our second quarter results with improving revenue trends, led by revenue growth in Enterprise, solid performance in IGAM on a constant currency basis and growth in consumer broadband.  
In the second quarter, in addition to improved revenue performance, we saw sequential and strong year-over-year growth in sales for both IGAM and Enterprise, somewhat offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and SMB.
While SMB sales haven't been as robust as Enterprise and IGAM, SMB revenue results were in line with prior quarters, demonstrating the resilience and importance of our services to these customers even in the face of the pandemic. We continue to believe we have tremendous opportunity and have made changes in our leadership and go-to-market approach to improve our performance in this segment. 
In the coming months, you will see us expand our efforts to grow our small business customer base, delivering a broader digital experience in our more than 170,000 fiber-fed on-net buildings.
Let me give you some color around our quarterly sales growth and funnel outlook by highlighting a couple of examples. As the pandemic hit the U.S. near the end of the first quarter, the priority for customers, like most of us, was to manage the crisis in front of them. Other than requirements for emergency connectivity, conversations about network expansions or future transformations understandably paused in the early days. 
But as customers have moved beyond the first wave of crisis response, we've seen a marked change in their engagement and increased urgency in their dialogue about longer-term digital transformation of their work environment and data platforms. It's a pivot we have noticed across our customer base, and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of our sales funnel.  
These discussions are about more than just network. As I noted earlier, this is about using our technology platform to provide services in new and effective ways to meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, we recently announced a contract with the State of Arizona to provide network connectivity and managed IT services that will support all state government agencies and transform how the state delivers services to its citizens. 
CenturyLink had previously won an AZNet contract, the type of connectivity contract that telecom companies frequently win. But because of our full range of solutions, we were able to expand our relationship beyond the network to include critical capabilities such as cloud-based integrated security, automation and cloud orchestration. This is the CenturyLink of the future, a company that delivers digital technology solutions to our customers, differentiated through our world-class fiber infrastructure.  
If you consider the increasing demand across all customer verticals to move massive data sets as quickly as possible to widely distributed processing resources, our infrastructure is very well aligned to meet this shift in requirements. By combining just 100-or-so of our existing technical spaces with our deeply distributed fiber network, we can serve around 95% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. 
Further, as operators of one of the largest and most interconnected networks in the world, we enable our customers to efficiently and effectively collect, process and move their data seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, public data centers, company-owned data centers and the various work locations of the enterprise, whether in employees' homes or in the office. And I see examples of this in our business every day.  
Turning to Slide 7 for a few examples. One of our customers, a food manufacturing facility, relies on CenturyLink to host their robotics control application. We built wireless connectivity across the factory floor, collect manufacturing data and distribute it in real time to the manufacturer suppliers across the country. All of this is delivered over our network with CenturyLink providing network security for the entire stack of applications on our platform.  
Similarly, we support online gaming customers that require very low latency and great connectivity to end users. Our edge compute capabilities and our deep global Internet peering have made CenturyLink an excellent platform to meet their needs. 
As a final example, a large U.S. retailer leverages our edge platform to move extensive compute resources from each store to our secure edge compute facilities, relying on our extremely low latency fiber network for connectivity, reducing their cost and complexity, while also improving performance of their data processing solutions. One customer has estimated 25% to 30% operational savings as a result.  
Supporting the deployment of 5G networks is another source of demand that we've seen gain traction. We continue to partner with our wireless customers to provide the fiber to run their 5G networks. It's long been obvious the key to effective wireless services is an extensive fiber network and the breadth and depth of our fiber infrastructure supports our ability to meet these needs. We've seen a few wins, but the volume of request is beginning to increase, and we are ramping our own capabilities to support the nationwide deployment to 5G. The alignment of our fiber and other infrastructure assets, the evolving market needs and our team's exceptional execution resulted in a solid quarter for our Enterprise business.  
Turning to consumer. As I said before, where we invest, we will grow, and you can see that in the second quarter broadband revenue, which grew year-over-year and sequentially. We remain disciplined, continuing with our micro-targeting strategy and funding our expansion, while also focusing on better penetration in areas already served. Year-to-date, we've added more than 200,000 new homes patched to our fiber footprint and have approximately 2.2 million homes addressable today.  
During the quarter, we added 42,000 1 gig and above customers, a record for us since we began expanding our Fiber to the Home efforts. I recently read a social media post comparing CenturyLink gigabit services to those of one of our large, very capable cable competitors. The writer got it all right. Our price per bit was lower, the pricing was simpler, and the lack of congestion, better upstream speed and lower latency of our network was better than the cable alternative. Everything about the experience made CenturyLink a clear winner in this writer's analysis.  
While this was a blog on our consumer services, the same benefits extend to our small business customers. We've been clear that our principal strategic focus is our Enterprise business, but we also embrace the consumer opportunity, and are very encouraged by the returns we see in consumer and small business fiber deployments.  
We've all been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, both at home and at work. CenturyLink is no exception, and it certainly has changed how we think about work-from-home and the distributed workforce. What has not changed is our long-term strategy, our long-term focus on the customer or the time lines of our ongoing digital transformation efforts.  
I continue to be impressed by our team members, how they're managing through the pandemic to deliver for our customers. And we remain in the primarily work-from-home environment with roughly 75% of our employees working from home and 25% working from work. We are currently planning a broader return to the office, and we'll follow a phased approach and will be fact-based by location in our decision-making. 
While a few specific employees may return earlier, I've told employees not to expect to return to the office before early fall. Like many of our customers, the crisis has accelerated our digital transformation and changes to our staffing model. Frankly, I don't expect we will ever return to work-from-work approach we had prior to the pandemic. 
Finally, I'll touch on our capital allocation strategy. We believe we have the right balance in investing for growth, reducing leverage and returning more than $1 billion per year in dividends to shareholders. I believe the actions we have taken in the past have put us in a good position for weathering COVID-19 and the economic downturn, and we will continue following the objectives we've laid out for you. We continue investing in the business. We have reduced our leverage to 3.7x and have no significant near-term maturities, and our ability to support our dividend speaks for itself with a payout ratio in the 30s. 
However, I don't believe CenturyLink's current market valuation properly reflects where we are as a company. Although we certainly have legacy businesses, the depth and capabilities of our fiber network, the strong demand for our services across both enterprise and consumer segments, the ongoing efforts to transform and fundamentally change the nature and cost of our service delivery model, the strength of our balance sheet and our relatively low dividend payout ratio makes us excited about our opportunities to transform and grow our business. Our focus is to drive toward that reality.  
In summary, we are pleased with the continued improvement in our revenue trajectory and the positive effects of our transformation into a technology company focused on building a platform for critical digital services. While the ongoing pandemic and economic environment creates near-term uncertainty, we believe our solutions and approach to the market are enabling our success and position us well for long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers embrace the fourth industrial revolution and digitally transform their businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Neel to discuss our financial results."
260149,676142489,2117323,"CenturyLink, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2020",2020-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Lumen Technologies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. We have seen steady improvement in total re",1482,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. 
We have seen steady improvement in total revenue performance over the last 5 quarters, primarily driven by Enterprise, IGAM and our consumer broadband business. We also had strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in our Enterprise segment. We saw continued progress on cost transformation initiatives achieving $110 million of incremental annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings during the quarter and delivered solid EBITDA and free cash flow, especially with higher COVID-related expenses and inefficiencies related to operating in the current environment. 
We made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives and pleased with our resulting interest cost savings. We also continued to lean in to capital spending during the quarter, driven by customer upgrades and supported by strong leading indicators. The connectivity services we provide are critical, and our revenue is largely recurring and highly diversified. Our second quarter results highlight that our business is resilient.  
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, for the second quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.2 billion, compared to a decline of 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.7%. On our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that about $1 billion or 5% of our annualized total revenues are from highly impacted industries. We did not see a material change this quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, in revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM, revenue declined 3.2% and declined 0.7% on a constant currency basis. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 1.8% and was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. In addition to currency headwinds, our international business across Europe, Latin America and Asia experienced reduced levels of activity from COVID-related shutdowns. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 1.7%. This compares to a decline of 1.8% in the second quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew about 1%. During the quarter, we upgraded the network infrastructure for several customers and saw strength in collaboration and related services. 
We see that customers are buying again, mostly focused on their immediate needs as they operate in the current environment. As Jeff mentioned, both IGAM and Enterprise sales orders grew year-over-year. Our sales teams continue to have good discussions with customers, indicating an acceleration of their digital strategies. We are cautiously optimistic and encouraged by the leading indicators for both Enterprise and IGAM.
SMB revenue decreased 6.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. This compares to an average decline of 7.1% over the last 4 quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, the current situation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we are monitoring and working closely with our customers. 
We also noted that SMB had exposure to highly-impacted industries of less than 10%, with approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenue from customers with less than 50 employees. This dynamic is largely unchanged in the second quarter.
Over the long term, we believe SMB represents a growth opportunity for us. We continue to invest in our product capabilities and customer experience improvement initiatives. It's a large addressable market and expect customer propensity to switch and our traction to increase when businesses return.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.3% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7.5% over the last 4 quarters. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1%. With respect to wholesale, we continue to expect these customers to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing some traction with carriers as they invest in 5G.
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2020, revenue declined 5.3% year-over-year compared to 8.1% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.8%, primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice revenue declines, offset by growth in broadband. 
Broadband revenue now represents 55% of our consumer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter 2019. Go forward performance will be largely driven by our execution around our Fiber to the Home investment strategy and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. Broadband revenue for the second quarter 2020 grew 1.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, broadband grew 0.6%. In the second quarter, we saw a net loss of 29,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 68,000 subs. Our customers that are participating in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge have been subtracted from the sub numbers that I just mentioned. 
I'll also note that besides our investments in Fiber to the Home, we are also investing in self-service capabilities as part of our digital transformation efforts. In addition to a better customer experience, these capabilities are a key component of our cost transformation plan.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the second quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.174 billion compared to $2.269 billion in the second quarter 2019 and $2.243 billion in the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, we increased our bad debt expense by $25 million against accounts receivable due to the possible and expected economic implications of the pandemic. We also incurred higher expenses such as overtime as we work to install expedited services for customers. In addition, we experienced some timing delays for cost transformation initiatives early in the quarter.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.9% compared to 42.2% in the year ago quarter. As you think about sequential EBITDA performance, keep in mind that COVID only impacted our first quarter results by 2 or 3 weeks versus a full quarter global impact in the second quarter.  
As of the end of the second quarter, we achieved approximately $620 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $510 million as of the end of the first quarter 2020. As we indicated last quarter, we saw some challenges early in the second quarter. But as the economy reopened, we gained good traction, and we were pleased with the run rate savings we achieved as we exited the quarter.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the second quarter 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $89 million and free cash flow by $63 million.  
For the second quarter 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion. This compares to second quarter 2019 CapEx of $800 million. During the quarter, we augmented capacity for our customers and supported higher traffic on the network. We are leaning in, in continuing to invest in our customers, our capabilities, and long-life fiber infrastructure assets.  
In the second quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $803 million, this compares to free cash flow of $956 million in the second quarter 2019. The year-over-year change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, offset by lower interest expenses. Given our cash flow profile, as I just mentioned, we are investing in the business, supported by positive demand drivers and leading indicators.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. Since announcing our 3-year plan to delever to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, we have reduced net debt by $2.5 billion. During the second quarter, we paid down $500 million in debt obligations and refinanced $1.2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $18 billion over the past 12 months and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $14 billion.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are lowering our GAAP interest expense to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion. We are also updating our cash interest expense to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion from our previous range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of guidance represents a savings of about $450 million relative to 2018 cash interest expense. The reduction is driven by our deleveraging and refinancing activities, coupled with a low interest rate environment.  
To summarize, our results highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. Our customers are accelerating their digital strategies. Our sales funnel is improving, and we're cautiously optimistic about the demand drivers. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year, investing in the business to improve revenue trajectory, returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend, with a payout ratio expected in the 30s and deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25. 
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. Franz, will you please explain the process?"

But the overall indicators are still positive.  
In terms of free cash flow, we still feel good about our payout being in the 30s. If you think about the dividend as a percentage of free cash flow. And so that gives you some sense that we feel that our free cash flow is going to be fairly resilient even in this environment."

We're focused on investing in growth, and you see what we've done with respect to revenue and sales in the second quarter for IGAM and Enterprise and consumer broadband. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. 
You've seen what we've done over the last couple of years in improving our EBITDA performance and making sure that we're investing and providing a great customer experience. And so when I think about the market valuation being wrong, I look at the business that we are. And I think that we're a very strong company, offering exactly what our customers need with -- that they're going to need in the future. It's not just what they need today, but it's also what they need tomorrow. And so we'll continue to focus on executing against that business plan. 
And then we're always open, and I've said this a number of times, but actively consider, are there other ways for us to release the value within CenturyLink. So we'll continue to focus on that, but primarily focused on us growing our business with our customers, investing in our growth and returning a good dividend to our shareholders."

So if you think about the strength we saw in voice and collaboration, you mentioned, that exactly is the point, that you need a lot more connectivity for a higher level of collaboration. So we did see request for a lot of upgrades that helped the quarter.  
We did see strength in collaboration. Over time, customers may meet those needs in different ways, but the key point from our perspective is that we have a broad range of products. And even if, going forward, the customers choose to meet that same collaboration need in a different way, we have the products to support that need.  
In terms of higher expenses, $25 million for bad debt. We also had over -- a fair amount of overtime during the quarter for installing expedited services. And as you can imagine, in this environment, with all the physical constraints, we're not exactly operating in the most efficient way. So I would say there's probably in the low tens of millions of additional cost embedded in the organization operating in this environment."

Fewer office locations? I do think they'll become more distributed. I do think that they will recognize that they need to locate their compute resources in different places, some in the public cloud, some in private data centers, some in our edge compute facilities, but they'll do that based on the application and the performance that they're looking out at out of that application and the network to provide it.
So I do think it will become more widely distributed. What does that mean for our Enterprise business? I think it means good things because our Enterprise business is focused on making sure that we deliver network and network-supported technologies to our customers to support that hybrid networking topology and making sure that we're matching our capabilities to the type of application they have.  
The thing that's most important is connectivity and bandwidth and latency. And so we will -- it will give us opportunities to make sure that we have more places to go to, more ways to use our deeply interconnected network. You can look at every major data center, you can look at public clouds and private clouds and eyeball networks. We operate a very deeply interconnected network, and that's a competitive advantage.  
With respect to SD-WAN, is it growing? Or not growing or VPNs? We think that there is a great opportunity for hybrid WAN. This is not an SD-WAN solution. It's not a VPN solution. It's a hybrid WAN solution, and we're continuing to work with our customers to roll out those capabilities and a more distributed workforce, a more distributed operating environment feeds into that hybrid WAN capability as well."

I don't know if they said about service delivery. I'm very confident in our service delivery. Our team has done a great job through this. I think on the second quarter call, I made a comment either in the prepared remarks or in the questions, about customers putting things on hold, that they're going into the COVID pandemic and they were concerned and basically said, ""Don't mess with the network. Don't touch it. Let's focus on operating, while we figure this out."" 
So things went on hold. We call that long-term customer hold. That has continued to reduce. What we've seen is post that crisis response is our customers not getting back to normal, but moving back that direction. And so we don't see the long-term customer hold. I think our service delivery team is second to none, and they haven't created -- we don't have any particular bottlenecks. They're doing a really good job of turning up capabilities. And so that book-to-bill process for us is pretty typical. 
Now we do still have some long-term customer hold because not everybody has stopped. But I wouldn't have called it out this quarter as an issue like I might have last quarter.  
On the second issue and from work for work and have we estimated for our own transformation? Are there -- what's that mean from a cost savings perspective? We are quite looking at it that way. We look at our transition back-to-work, and we step back from what does the transition look like? And we say, what is work of the future look like? How do we want to do business in CenturyLink? And where do we think it's best and optimized to do so? 
And so right now, we're in the middle of that effort to make sure that we look at what the future of work within CenturyLink looks like, what mix of it should be done in the office, what mix of it should be done remotely, how do we think about that, how do we think about the jobs, did the jobs change as the products and services are evolving? 
And so our transformation efforts are really longer-term looking at how do we think about the business going forward. And we haven't looked right now and said, ""Well, should we change any of our expectations on the existing targets that we put out there?"" We basically said, what are we trying to build as a company? What's the best way to do that? And then how do we transition to that as we move back from a work-from-home environment?  
Now my color in the prepared remarks, so basically, just to say, I don't expect to go back to the way it was. And I don't expect our customers to go back to the way it was.

In terms of your returns, not -- they vary. But in general, I would say, there's a couple of things. One, the returns we see are good because we have a micro-targeting approach, as you've heard Jeff talk about in numerous occasions. We don't really go out and build an entire city. We really go pick the neighborhoods where we can get high returns because it's a function of population density or home density and the cost to build.

So before I wrap up today's call, I want to leave you with a couple of key thoughts -- a few key thoughts. 
As customers increasingly rely on CenturyLink's fast and secure platform, we saw strong improvement in revenue performance and growth in the sales during the quarter. While we still see uncertainties related to COVID-19, we're optimistic about our ability to drive revenue growth in the core areas of our business, and we're focused on reducing costs for the legacy services we provide. 
Our liquidity position is strong, enabling us to invest through this cycle to meet long-term demand where we see opportunities to do so. Our approach to capital allocation is serving us well as we continue to invest in the business, make progress on our deleveraging objectives and support the dividend with comfortable payout ratio in the 30s.  
We continue to drive our transformation initiatives. We see the results in improved customer experience, better alignment with how our customers want to interact with us and lower costs. And as always, we remain very focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term.

On today's call, I'll provide my thoughts on our second quarter results, the market demand we see for dynamic, robust fiber-based services that are at the heart of CenturyLink and how we continue to position the company to grow as we meet that demand. After that, Neel will provide an overview of the quarter, and then we will open it up to your questions.  
I'll start with the solid results we delivered in the second quarter. Our team has done an incredible job of maintaining direct engagement with our enterprise customers. We've begun to see our customers adapt to the new normal of COVID-19 and resume their digital transformation efforts. They see that using next-generation technologies enable them to adapt their business models more rapidly and are working to take advantage of tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning across distributed compute resources and high-performance networking. This translates into greater demand for transport services, hybrid WAN connectivity, network-based security, edge computing and managed services as enterprises adjust to a more data-dependent and distributed operating environment.  
This new normal has also increased consumers' need for digital services and the demand for data shows no signs of slowing. The economic effects of the pandemic create uncertainty for our customers, partners, the company and the market in general. But the pandemic has also highlighted the absolutely essential and durable nature of CenturyLink services and infrastructure in an all-digital world. Now more than ever, businesses realize that to thrive, they must acquire, analyze and act on data and deliver the digital applications and experiences that people need.  
As you can see on Slide 4, we own the critical infrastructure, everything from the extensive fiber network to the deep peering and interconnection relationships required to deliver customers' agile, scalable, secure network infrastructure that is easily and flexibly consumed. 
I'm proud of how responsive our employees have been to customers and how they have delivered with speed and urgency. This agility is key to our strategy and is underpinned by our ongoing transformation from a telecom service provider to a leading technology company, providing network and network-supported technology solutions to today's digital market.  
We all know how well positioned our infrastructure is, but our value proposition is more than having great infrastructure. I frequently talk to employees about how our relationships with customers must be rooted in CenturyLink's capabilities to drive their success rather than the mindset of speeds and feeds and circuits of a typical telecom company. As a technology company, we combine our deep infrastructure strength with a digital operating environment that enables our customers to turn their data and connectivity into a strategic advantage. We integrate network, compute and operational technologies with managed services to simplify their business operation. Capabilities like orchestration services help them control the thousands of widely-distributed devices and digital assets they now have to manage. 
The COVID-19 crisis didn't create this need, but it has certainly amplified and accelerated it. And you can see this in our second quarter results with improving revenue trends, led by revenue growth in Enterprise, solid performance in IGAM on a constant currency basis and growth in consumer broadband.  
In the second quarter, in addition to improved revenue performance, we saw sequential and strong year-over-year growth in sales for both IGAM and Enterprise, somewhat offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and SMB.
While SMB sales haven't been as robust as Enterprise and IGAM, SMB revenue results were in line with prior quarters, demonstrating the resilience and importance of our services to these customers even in the face of the pandemic. We continue to believe we have tremendous opportunity and have made changes in our leadership and go-to-market approach to improve our performance in this segment. 
In the coming months, you will see us expand our efforts to grow our small business customer base, delivering a broader digital experience in our more than 170,000 fiber-fed on-net buildings.
Let me give you some color around our quarterly sales growth and funnel outlook by highlighting a couple of examples. As the pandemic hit the U.S. near the end of the first quarter, the priority for customers, like most of us, was to manage the crisis in front of them. Other than requirements for emergency connectivity, conversations about network expansions or future transformations understandably paused in the early days. 
But as customers have moved beyond the first wave of crisis response, we've seen a marked change in their engagement and increased urgency in their dialogue about longer-term digital transformation of their work environment and data platforms. It's a pivot we have noticed across our customer base and it's one of the key drivers in the growth of our sales funnel.  
These discussions are about more than just network. As I noted earlier, this is about using our technology platform to provide services in new and effective ways to meet the evolving needs of our customers. For example, we recently announced a contract with the State of Arizona to provide network connectivity and managed IT services that will support all state government agencies and transform how the state delivers services to its citizens. 
CenturyLink had previously won an AZNet contract, the type of connectivity contract that telecom companies frequently win. But because of our full range of solutions, we were able to expand our relationship beyond the network to include critical capabilities such as cloud-based integrated security, automation and cloud orchestration. This is the CenturyLink of the future, a company that delivers digital technology solutions to our customers, differentiated through our world-class fiber infrastructure.  
If you consider the increasing demand across all customer verticals to move massive data sets as quickly as possible to widely distributed processing resources, our infrastructure is very well aligned to meet this shift in requirements. By combining just 100-or-so of our existing technical spaces with our deeply distributed fiber network, we can serve around 95% of U.S. Enterprise locations within 5 milliseconds of latency. 
Further, as operators of one of the largest and most interconnected networks in the world, we enable our customers to efficiently and effectively collect, process and move their data seamlessly across public clouds, private clouds, public data centers, company-owned data centers and the various work locations of the enterprise, whether in employees' homes or in the office. And I see examples of this in our business every day.  
Turning to Slide 7 for a few examples. One of our customers, a food manufacturing facility, relies on CenturyLink to host their robotics control application. We built wireless connectivity across the factory floor, collect manufacturing data and distribute it in real time to the manufacturer suppliers across the country. All of this is delivered over our network with CenturyLink providing network security for the entire stack of applications on our platform.  
Similarly, we support online gaming customers that require very low latency and great connectivity to end users. Our edge compute capabilities and our deep global Internet peering have made CenturyLink an excellent platform to meet their needs. 
As a final example, a large U.S. retailer leverages our edge platform to move extensive compute resources from each store to our secure edge compute facilities, relying on our extremely low latency fiber network for connectivity, reducing their cost and complexity, while also improving performance of their data processing solutions. One customer has estimated 25% to 30% operational savings as a result.  
Supporting the deployment of 5G networks is another source of demand that we've seen gain traction. We continue to partner with our wireless customers to provide the fiber to run their 5G networks. It's long been obvious the key to effective wireless services is an extensive fiber network and the breadth and depth of our fiber infrastructure supports our ability to meet these needs. We've seen a few wins, but the volume of request is beginning to increase and we are ramping our own capabilities to support the nationwide deployment to 5G. The alignment of our fiber and other infrastructure assets, the evolving market needs and our team's exceptional execution resulted in a solid quarter for our Enterprise business.  
Turning to consumer. As I said before, where we invest, we will grow, and you can see that in the second quarter broadband revenue, which grew year-over-year and sequentially. We remain disciplined, continuing with our micro-targeting strategy and funding our expansion, while also focusing on better penetration in areas already served. Year-to-date, we've added more than 200,000 new homes patched to our fiber footprint and have approximately 2.2 million homes addressable today.  
During the quarter, we added 42,000 1 gig and above customers, a record for us since we began expanding our Fiber to the Home efforts. I recently read a social media post comparing CenturyLink gigabit services to those of one of our large, very capable cable competitors. The writer got it all right. Our price per bit was lower, the pricing was simpler, and the lack of congestion, better upstream speed and lower latency of our network was better than the cable alternative. Everything about the experience made CenturyLink a clear winner in this writer's analysis.  
While this was a blog on our consumer services, the same benefits extend to our small business customers. We've been clear that our principal strategic focus is our Enterprise business, but we also embrace the consumer opportunity, and are very encouraged by the returns we see in consumer and small business fiber deployments.  
We've all been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, both at home and at work. CenturyLink is no exception, and it certainly has changed how we think about work-from-home and the distributed workforce. What has not changed is our long-term strategy, our long-term focus on the customer or the time lines of our ongoing digital transformation efforts.  
I continue to be impressed by our team members, how they're managing through the pandemic to deliver for our customers. And we remain in the primarily work-from-home environment with roughly 75% of our employees working from home and 25% working from work. We are currently planning a broader return to the office and we'll follow a phased approach and will be fact-based by location in our decision-making. 
While a few specific employees may return earlier, I've told employees not to expect to return to the office before early fall. Like many of our customers, the crisis has accelerated our digital transformation and changes to our staffing model. Frankly, I don't expect we will ever return to work-from-work approach we had prior to the pandemic. 
Finally, I'll touch on our capital allocation strategy. We believe we have the right balance in investing for growth, reducing leverage and returning more than $1 billion per year in dividends to shareholders. I believe the actions we have taken in the past have put us in a good position for weathering COVID-19 and the economic downturn and we will continue following the objectives we've laid out for you. We continue investing in the business. We have reduced our leverage to 3.7x and have no significant near-term maturities and our ability to support our dividend speaks for itself with a payout ratio in the 30s. 
However, I don't believe CenturyLink's current market valuation properly reflects where we are as a company. Although we certainly have legacy businesses, the depth and capabilities of our fiber network, the strong demand for our services across both enterprise and consumer segments, the ongoing efforts to transform and fundamentally change the nature and cost of our service delivery model, the strength of our balance sheet and our relatively low dividend payout ratio makes us excited about our opportunities to transform and grow our business. Our focus is to drive toward that reality.  
In summary, we are pleased with the continued improvement in our revenue trajectory and the positive effects of our transformation into a technology company focused on building a platform for critical digital services. While the ongoing pandemic and economic environment creates near-term uncertainty, we believe our solutions and approach to the market are enabling our success and position us well for long-term growth. We are excited about the opportunity to help our customers embrace the fourth industrial revolution and digitally transform their businesses. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Neel to discuss our financial results."

We have seen steady improvement in total re",1482,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter, especially with the full quarter impact from a global pandemic and economic uncertainty. I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. 
We have seen steady improvement in total revenue performance over the last 5 quarters, primarily driven by Enterprise, IGAM and our consumer broadband business. We also had strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in our Enterprise segment. We saw continued progress on cost transformation initiatives achieving $110 million of incremental annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings during the quarter and delivered solid EBITDA and free cash flow, especially with higher COVID-related expenses and inefficiencies related to operating in the current environment. 
We made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives and pleased with our resulting interest cost savings. We also continued to lean in to capital spending during the quarter, driven by customer upgrades and supported by strong leading indicators. The connectivity services we provide are critical, and our revenue is largely recurring and highly diversified. Our second quarter results highlight that our business is resilient.  
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, for the second quarter 2020, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.2 billion, compared to a decline of 5.6% in the second quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.7%. On our first quarter earnings call, we mentioned that about $1 billion or 5% of our annualized total revenues are from highly impacted industries. We did not see a material change this quarter.
Moving to Slide 9, in revenue by business segment. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM, revenue declined 3.2% and declined 0.7% on a constant currency basis. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 1.8% and was roughly flat on a constant currency basis. In addition to currency headwinds, our international business across Europe, Latin America and Asia experienced reduced levels of activity from COVID-related shutdowns. 
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 1.7%. This compares to a decline of 1.8% in the second quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew about 1%. During the quarter, we upgraded the network infrastructure for several customers and saw strength in collaboration and related services. 
We see that customers are buying again, mostly focused on their immediate needs as they operate in the current environment. As Jeff mentioned, both IGAM and Enterprise sales orders grew year-over-year. Our sales teams continue to have good discussions with customers, indicating an acceleration of their digital strategies. We are cautiously optimistic and encouraged by the leading indicators for both Enterprise and IGAM.
SMB revenue decreased 6.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. This compares to an average decline of 7.1% over the last 4 quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, the current situation is likely to have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we are monitoring and working closely with our customers. 
We also noted that SMB had exposure to highly-impacted industries of less than 10%, with approximately $1.6 billion of annualized revenue from customers with less than 50 employees. This dynamic is largely unchanged in the second quarter.
Over the long term, we believe SMB represents a growth opportunity for us. We continue to invest in our product capabilities and customer experience improvement initiatives. It's a large addressable market and expect customer propensity to switch and our traction to increase when businesses return.  
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.3% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7.5% over the last 4 quarters. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1%. With respect to wholesale, we continue to expect these customers to optimize spending with other vendors in this environment. However, as Jeff mentioned, we are seeing some traction with carriers as they invest in 5G.
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the second quarter of 2020, revenue declined 5.3% year-over-year compared to 8.1% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.8%, primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice revenue declines, offset by growth in broadband. 
Broadband revenue now represents 55% of our consumer revenue, up from 47% in the second quarter 2019. Go forward performance will be largely driven by our execution around our Fiber to the Home investment strategy and driving up penetration of our competitive assets. Broadband revenue for the second quarter 2020 grew 1.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, broadband grew 0.6%. In the second quarter, we saw a net loss of 29,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 68,000 subs. Our customers that are participating in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge have been subtracted from the sub numbers that I just mentioned. 
I'll also note that besides our investments in Fiber to the Home, we are also investing in self-service capabilities as part of our digital transformation efforts. In addition to a better customer experience, these capabilities are a key component of our cost transformation plan.  
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the second quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.174 billion compared to $2.269 billion in the second quarter 2019 and $2.243 billion in the first quarter of 2020. During the quarter, we increased our bad debt expense by $25 million against accounts receivable due to the possible and expected economic implications of the pandemic. We also incurred higher expenses such as overtime as we work to install expedited services for customers. In addition, we experienced some timing delays for cost transformation initiatives early in the quarter.  
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 41.9% compared to 42.2% in the year ago quarter. As you think about sequential EBITDA performance, keep in mind that COVID only impacted our first quarter results by 2 or 3 weeks versus a full quarter global impact in the second quarter.  
As of the end of the second quarter, we achieved approximately $620 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $510 million as of the end of the first quarter 2020. As we indicated last quarter, we saw some challenges early in the second quarter. But as the economy reopened, we gained good traction, and we were pleased with the run rate savings we achieved as we exited the quarter.  
We remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the second quarter 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $89 million and free cash flow by $63 million.  
For the second quarter 2020, capital expenditures were approximately $1 billion. This compares to second quarter 2019 CapEx of $800 million. During the quarter, we augmented capacity for our customers and supported higher traffic on the network. We are leaning in, in continuing to invest in our customers, our capabilities, and long-life fiber infrastructure assets.  
In the second quarter 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $803 million, this compares to free cash flow of $956 million in the second quarter 2019. The year-over-year change in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, offset by lower interest expenses. Given our cash flow profile, as I just mentioned, we are investing in the business, supported by positive demand drivers and leading indicators.  
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. Since announcing our 3-year plan to delever to a target range of 2.75x to 3.25x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, we have reduced net debt by $2.5 billion. During the second quarter, we paid down $500 million in debt obligations and refinanced $1.2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $18 billion over the past 12 months and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $14 billion.  
Turning to Slide 13. We are lowering our GAAP interest expense to $1.7 billion from $1.8 billion. We are also updating our cash interest expense to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion from our previous range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of guidance represents a savings of about $450 million relative to 2018 cash interest expense. The reduction is driven by our deleveraging and refinancing activities, coupled with a low interest rate environment.  
To summarize, our results highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. Our customers are accelerating their digital strategies. Our sales funnel is improving, and we're cautiously optimistic about the demand drivers. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are strong. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year, investing in the business to improve revenue trajectory, returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend, with a payout ratio expected in the 30s and deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25.

So if you think about the strength we saw in voice and collaboration, you mentioned, that exactly is the point, that you need a lot more connectivity for a higher level of collaboration. So we did see request for a lot of upgrades that helped the quarter.  
We did see strength in collaboration. Over time, customers may meet those needs in different ways, but the key point from our perspective is that we have a broad range of products. And even if, going forward, the customers choose to meet that same collaboration need in a different way, we have the products to support that need.  
In terms of higher expenses, $25 million for bad debt. We also had over -- a fair amount of overtime during the quarter for installing expedited services. And as you can imagine, in this environment, with all the physical constraints, we're not exactly operating in the most efficient way. So I would say there's probably in the low tens of millions of additional cost embedded in the organization operating in this environment."

Fewer office locations? I do think they'll become more distributed.

So I do think it will become more widely distributed. What does that mean for our Enterprise business? I think it means good things because our Enterprise business is focused on making sure that we deliver network and network-supported technologies to our customers to support that hybrid networking topology and making sure that we're matching our capabilities to the type of application they have.  
The thing that's most important is connectivity and bandwidth and latency. And so we will -- it will give us opportunities to make sure that we have more places to go to, more ways to use our deeply interconnected network. You can look at every major data center, you can look at public clouds and private clouds and eyeball networks. We operate a very deeply interconnected network, and that's a competitive advantage.  
With respect to SD-WAN, is it growing? Or not growing or VPNs? We think that there is a great opportunity for hybrid WAN. This is not an SD-WAN solution. It's not a VPN solution. It's a hybrid WAN solution, and we're continuing to work with our customers to roll out those capabilities and a more distributed workforce, a more distributed operating environment feeds into that hybrid WAN capability as well."

I don't know if they said about service delivery. I'm very confident in our service delivery. Our team has done a great job through this. I think on the second quarter call, I made a comment either in the prepared remarks or in the questions, about customers putting things on hold, that they're going into the COVID pandemic and they were concerned and basically said, ""Don't mess with the network. Don't touch it. Let's focus on operating, while we figure this out."" 
So things went on hold. We call that long-term customer hold. That has continued to reduce. What we've seen is post that crisis response is our customers not getting back to normal, but moving back that direction. And so we don't see the long-term customer hold. I think our service delivery team is second to none, and they haven't created -- we don't have any particular bottlenecks. They're doing a really good job of turning up capabilities. And so that book-to-bill process for us is pretty typical. 
Now we do still have some long-term customer hold because not everybody has stopped. But I wouldn't have called it out this quarter as an issue like I might have last quarter.  
On the second issue and from work for work and have we estimated for our own transformation? Are there -- what's that mean from a cost savings perspective? We are quite looking at it that way. We look at our transition back-to-work, and we step back from what does the transition look like? And we say, what is work of the future look like? How do we want to do business in CenturyLink? And where do we think it's best and optimized to do so? 
And so right now, we're in the middle of that effort to make sure that we look at what the future of work within CenturyLink looks like, what mix of it should be done in the office, what mix of it should be done remotely, how do we think about that, how do we think about the jobs, did the jobs change as the products and services are evolving? 
And so our transformation efforts are really longer-term looking at how do we think about the business going forward. And we haven't looked right now and said, ""Well should we change any of our expectations on the existing targets that we put out there?"" We basically said, what are we trying to build as a company? What's the best way to do that? And then how do we transition to that as we move back from a work-from-home environment?  
Now my color in the prepared remarks, so basically, just to say, I don't expect to go back to the way it was. And I don't expect our customers to go back to the way it was. And I frankly think that's good for CenturyLink overall, as we look to support our business and we look to support our customers."

In terms of your returns, not -- they vary. But in general, I would say, there's a couple of things. One, the returns we see are good because we have a micro-targeting approach, as you've heard Jeff talk about in numerous occasions. We don't really go out and build an entire city.

But I don't think that -- and there are aspects of our -- helping our customers evolve in digital transformation that could affect those products. But my goal is not only to help CenturyLink -- existing CenturyLink customers go out and transform digitally, but it's my goal to go out and get other companies' customers to digitally transform.

After that, Neel will review our third quarter financial results, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We delivered another solid quarter, improving our year-over-year revenue performance and delivering sequential EBITDA as we continue to transform our business. Customers rely on Lumen to enable their digital transformation, and we're seeing that in our sales trends. Following a strong second quarter, sales for IGAM and enterprise segments were good, and sales for SMB customers were in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the steady demand we see  
[Audio Gap] 
another strong quarter for consumer broadband revenue with both year-over-year and sequential revenue growth. And recorded our 11th consecutive quarter of growth in broadband ARPU. This quarter, we added 46,000 gigabit subscribers, surpassing the record we set last quarter. 
Our results confirm our thesis for the consumer business. We win customers where we invest in fiber, simplify the experience and use micro-targeting in selecting the areas we serve. We believe our consumer fiber offering is the best in the market, and our customer satisfaction results are showing consumers value dedicated and reliable bandwidth. 
As you've heard me say many times, our operational improvements lead to highly satisfied customers, more durable revenue, and they allow us to reduce the cost of our operations. Our relentless focus in these areas is delivering results you can see in 2 ways this quarter. First, despite higher seasonal expenses, we delivered sequential adjusted EBITDA growth. Second, we were recently recognized by Newsweek on their 2021 list of Top Customer Service Brands, scoring the highest of all named Internet service providers. We've made a lot of progress and see additional opportunities to improve. 
Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter. We are focused on improving top line revenue and driving EBITDA growth. 
We also remain committed to the capital allocation strategy summarized on Slide 4 and the leverage targets we set at the beginning of last year. Our first priority is to invest in the business, driving growth, transforming our customer experience and improving our operating costs. Our second objective is to reduce leverage, and we further strengthened the balance sheet this quarter through several capital market transactions continuing to reduce both leverage and interest expense. Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend, and are very comfortable with a dividend payout ratio in the 30s, one of the lowest payout ratios compared to our large peers. 
We believe the balance we achieved through this 3-pronged capital allocation has served us well through the COVID pandemic and the uncertainty in the economy, giving us ample liquidity to continue to invest for growth, reduce debt and return capital through our dividend. Within the company, our mostly work-from-home team continues to excel as a distributed workforce. We have maintained small dedicated teams to drive speed and collaboration on our key product and operational initiatives and continue to use data-oriented technologies to operate at the highest levels in service delivery and service assurance. In fact, we've been using this time and our own experience to understand and develop solutions for the fourth Industrial Revolution and a work-from-anywhere mindset. 
Turning to the launch of Lumen. A couple of years ago, we challenged ourselves to chart a bold vision for what kind of company we wanted to be. During that effort, it became obvious that the company was firmly in a position to successfully help our customers acquire, analyze and act on their data. Lumen does this through the use of applications securely delivered across a hybrid cloud from massive data centers, all the way to the edge. In that moment, Lumen was born with the goal of delivering the fastest, most secure platform for next-gen applications and data. In September, we rebranded to Lumen Technologies to introduce this new vision to the market. Lumen is more than just a new name and logo. In a world that is rapidly changing, it signals a new era for our company, where we combine an all digital delivery model, software-defined networking and one of the very best fiber and network infrastructures into a platform of capabilities designed to drive our customers' success. 
Although we've been in a rapidly changing industry for the past 30 years, with the advent of the fourth Industrial Revolution, the pace of change is accelerating. And I believe Lumen is uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from this rapid change. The Lumen platform, grounded on a broad, fiber-based foundation and delivering virtualized network cloud, security and voice services, continues to be essential to customers as we see them augment their capabilities to support new work environments and emerging technologies. 
Lumen's capabilities lie at the heart of enabling that demand. And as you can see on the Slide 5, the Lumen platform is designed to bring together all of our assets, IP, services and expertise to deliver the world-class experience customers expect from Lumen. We give our customers access to cloud edge facilities, hosting critical applications within 5 milliseconds of digital transactions, enabling IoT and other next-gen use cases; software-defined networks that can create new connections around the world in seconds; network-based threat intelligence that protects our customers' data and proactively stop malicious factors; and massive network infrastructure with long-haul fiber and IP networks providing connectivity to private data centers, public data centers, cloud service providers, 5G operators and the array of global network serving end users. 
As amazing as our capabilities are today, we continue to invest to ensure our platform offers the fastest, most capable and resilient fiber-based services to support our customers' application and data needs. This approach enables us to deliver a continually improving platform that will help improve our revenue trajectory and take advantage of the growing addressable markets for these services. 
I'm also very pleased with the pace at which we are simplifying and digitizing the way businesses purchase and consume their networking, cloud edge and security solutions from us. We are driving a digital-first culture that allows our customers to configure, order and rapidly deploy our services through an all digital, self-service set of tools. 
We are certainly known for our fiber infrastructure, but over that infrastructure, we delivered digital services like Lumen Hyper Land, Lumen Dynamic Connections, Lumen DDoS Mitigation, that are completely transforming how we serve our customers, allowing them to consume our platform services in ways that are flexible and easy. 
Beyond enabling fast, secure connections and simplifying our customer experience, Lumen is also enabling partners to use our platform to deliver best-of-breed capabilities while also speeding our time to market. As an example is our partnership with Zoom. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an explosion in demand for Internet-based collaboration services. Zoom is a market leader in this space as well as a longtime valued customer of Lumen. We are delighted our platform supports the amazing services they provide.  In late September, we announced a new partnership to incorporate Zoom into Lumen's portfolio of voice and collaboration services and are excited by the early commercial traction we've already seen. Long term, we think we can develop enhanced customer experiences by further integrating Zoom's technology with the rich capabilities and deep reach of the Lumen platform. 
The second example is the partnership we announced with VMware, a significant collaboration covering edge compute, networking and security. Utilizing the VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud solution and the recently announced VMware Secure Access Service Edge Platform, we have the ability to integrate VMware services to deliver a work-from-anywhere platform on our global edge infrastructure to create solutions for businesses of all sizes across a variety of industries. 
As I've mentioned, customers need to move processing capabilities from remote data centers or the core of the cloud to the very edge of the network, close to where the data is generated, whether providing bare metal-as-a-service or full-blown edge computing resources, the cloud edge and network-as-a-service capabilities of the Lumen platform are integrated into a single experience for the customer and deliver low latency connectivity to more than 95% of the U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds.  The edge computing market is forecasted to be anywhere from $10 billion to $40 billion over the next several years, and we are very focused on leveraging our widely distributed fiber and edge data facilities to aggressively pursue this opportunity. 
I'm pleased to say that we're already making great progress on our cloud edge plans. We just turned up the first block of cloud edge nodes, and subsequent blocks are well underway. Even before we officially launched the product, a major media company began using our cloud edge platform to deliver live sporting events, and it is providing them exactly the capabilities and performance they hoped. 
A very different type of enterprise customer already deploying on the Lumen cloud edge is CyberReef. CyberReef provides remote learning solutions for public school systems, and the COVID pandemic is driving tremendous growth for their services. CyberReef's kid Internet Defense Shield required highly distributed compute resources, combined with high capacity network connections and deeply tiered Internet infrastructure, placing their security tools close to the school systems they support. In other words, Lumen's cloud edge platform and the Lumen network were a perfect fit to this customer, and a great example of how high-performance networking, combined with distributed compute can deliver next-generation services. 
Lastly, in the quarter, we turned out our Lumen Cloud Edge Experience Center in Denver, where customers, partners and vendors can remotely deploy edge compute technologies on our platform and test them with live networking under real-life conditions. Within a couple of days of the launch of the Experience Center, a major cloud service provider loaded their cloud extension software to begin testing, and we are working with other partners and customers to begin testing their applications as well. As a result, and in partnership with multiple cloud service providers, software-as-a-service providers and other key partners, we expect to deliver capabilities like artificial intelligence, machine learning and distributed analytics for enterprises over the Lumen platform. 
As you can see on Slide 6, we Lumen is the name of our company and our flagship brand for certain enterprise and wholesale markets, we also launched Quantum Fiber. Quantum Fiber is our brand for serving fiber-based services to small business and consumer customers. And just as with Lumen enterprise customers, we're offering our client and customers a simplified, highly digital customer experience with expanded tools for managing their Quantum platform with mass market efficiency. 
As we continue deploying Quantum Fiber services to the small business segment, we intend to utilize our more than 170,000 on-net, fiber-fed buildings as a starting point, targeting small businesses in tens of thousands of existing buildings. We know that bandwidth is critical for these customers. And our simple, resilient, all-digital Quantum services are well positioned to meet those needs. 
While Lumen's primary focus is enterprise, we have a dedicated leadership team whose sole focus is to leverage our Quantum investments to grow the consumer and small business markets. 
Finally, the CenturyLink brand will remain in place for our consumer and small business customers who received traditional services over traditional hybrid fiber copper networks. 
As a quick recap, Lumen is more than just a new name. We are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and the work we've done over the past 2.5 years to capture that opportunity and to launch Lumen. As our customers embrace the fourth Industrial Revolution, the Lumen platform delivers adaptive, secure and resilient capabilities over one of the world's best fiber infrastructures. We are focused on enabling our customers' success in integrating those capabilities within their own operating environment. 
We are very excited about the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel. Neel?"

During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our plan and made substantial progress transforming and positioning the company for the future. As Jeff mentioned, we rebranded Lumen and made a purposeful shift in aggressively going after emerging opportunities with growing addressable markets.  We had solid third quarter results, which highlights the resilience and relevance of the products and services we offer, particularly given the current backdrop of economic uncertainty. 
I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. Total revenue performance improved compared to the year ago quarter. We had another quarter of steady progress on our cost transformation savings initiatives. While we incurred higher costs due to seasonally high utility expenses, a global brand launch and the cost and efficiencies of operating in the current environment, we grew adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis. We continue to invest in the business while delivering solid free cash flow. During the quarter, we also made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives. 
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.167 billion, compared to a decline of 4.8% in the third quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.5%. 
Moving to Slide 9. In revenue by business segment on a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts, or IGAM, revenue declined 3.6% and declined 2.6% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by COVID resurgence and related weakness in our international business. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 1.6% and 2.4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see good demand from a subset of our largest customers whose business models are benefiting from the current environment. However, during the quarter, we saw a reduced level of activity due to COVID in our international business, particularly across Europe and Latin America. 
Moving to our enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by 0.8%. This compares to a 0.9% increase in the third quarter of 2019. On a sequential basis, enterprise grew 0.4%. Both sequential and year-over-year performance benefited from strength in our federal business and installs from sales earlier this year. SMB revenue decreased 5.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we have mentioned before, we expect COVID would likely have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we continue to monitor this closely. In general, while we haven't seen an increase in churn, as you might expect, we have seen a decrease in sales, both year-over-year and sequentially. Additionally, during the quarter, within SMB, we sold our legacy correctional facility communications business. The sale of this business at the end of August impacted revenue by about $5 million in the third quarter and will have a full quarter impact of about $15 million in the fourth quarter. Wholesale revenue decreased 6.7% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7% over the prior 4 quarters. Sequentially, revenue was flat. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we did see a benefit from a carrier settlement of approximately $15 million. In terms of products, this quarter, the trajectory of legacy voice revenue returned to pre-COVID levels. But as expected, customers are meeting that need for higher collaboration by transitioning volume and spend to our other connectivity products and services. 
In summary, across our business groups and as we have all seen across the broader economy, the acceleration of the digital economy is impacting every business. While some are able to lean into it and we are seeing good demand from those customers, others are challenged in this environment and delaying buying decisions. 
Turning to consumer on Slide 10. For the third quarter 2020, revenue declined 4.1% year-over-year compared to 9.7% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.5%, primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice declines, offset by growth in broadband. Broadband revenue for the third quarter 2020 grew 1.7% year-over-year and 0.6% on a sequential basis. In the third quarter, in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 62,000 subs. From a mix perspective, 13% of our total broadband subs now have greater than 100 meg speeds compared to 5% at the beginning of last year. We now have approximately 2.3 million homes passed with fiber, compared to about 2 million at year-end 2019.  As we have mentioned before, we expect that future performance will be largely driven by our execution around our Fiber to the Home investment strategy in driving up penetration of our competitive assets. 
Our revenue performance has been driven by this focus on our competitive assets, where we can support higher speeds, tend to have higher ARPU and generally see lower churn. Moreover, our digital customer experience initiatives will not only improve customer interactions, but are expected to continue to improve the margin profile of our consumer broadband business. We also remain committed to supporting our customers that are working through the current economic uncertainty or who have participated in the Keep Americans Connected collection. As a reminder, those customers have been subtracted from our sub counts, and were the primary driver of the change in low seed sub counts this quarter. 
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the third quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.19 billion, compared to $2.261 billion in the third quarter 2019 and $2.174 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Despite a global brand rollout, seasonally higher utility costs and COVID-related inefficiencies as a result of our focus on profitable revenues and cost transformation initiatives, we grew adjusted EBITDA sequentially. Specific to bad debt, our expense this quarter was down $10 million sequentially and roughly $15 million higher than pre-COVID levels. Our DSOs have been relatively stable, and we continue to work closely with our customers on payment arrangements. Given our current experience, we expect our bad debt expense to continue to decrease sequentially to pre-COVID levels. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 42.4% compared to 42.3% in the year ago quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, we achieved approximately $730 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $620 million as of the end of the previous quarter. Given the challenges related to COVID, we continue to be pleased with the run rate savings we achieved this year. We also remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the third quarter of 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $78 million and free cash flow by $111 million. For the third quarter of 2020, capital expenditures were $988 million. This compares to third quarter 2019 CapEx of $957 million. We are investing in the products and services that support the Lumen platform. We also continue to invest in expanding our fiber footprint in our digital customer and employee experience. In the third quarter of 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $917 million. This compares to free cash flow of $983 million in the third quarter of 2019. 
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. During the third quarter, we paid down $550 million in debt obligations and refinanced $2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $19 billion since we announced the deleveraging plan last year, and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $15 billion. We remain focused on getting to our target leverage ratio of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. 
As we move to our financial outlook on Slide 13, we continue to see uncertainty as the level of impact and buyer behaviors vary widely across our very diverse customer base. Over the long term, we think the demand dynamics and the acceleration of the digital economy is net positive for our business. However, in the short term, we will likely see customers being cautious as they work through their return-to-work plans. Despite the overall market uncertainty, we are optimistic about the resilience of our business. And for the fourth quarter, we expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from $2.19 billion this quarter. Additionally, given continued progress in our deleveraging initiatives and aided by current market conditions, we are lowering and narrowing our cash interest expense to a range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion from our previous range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. Our net cash interest expense this year is expected to be about $500 million lower compared to 2018. 
To summarize, our results continue to highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. We are delivering strong bottom line results while we are leaning in and investing to improve our revenue trajectory. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong and are continually improving. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year. We are investing to position the company for the future, deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25 and returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend with a payout ratio that we continue to expect to be in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow.

We have similarly investment in the brand and investment in our products and services, a lot of which Jeff touched on in his remarks. Utilities will come down, which is seasonal. We expect bad debt to continue to come down. And the remainder will be driven by our performance on revenue.  So at a high level, that's kind of the primary strongest sequential EBITDA performance standpoint.  
From year-over-year, we did see good improvement in revenue, like I mentioned, $3.4 million versus the $4.8 million. We have a good funnel, and we feel good about the quarter. But the only thing that we're a little cautious about, some of the resurgence we're seeing and how that impacts customer activity."

We have hundreds of people dedicated to cloud edge to make sure that we have the right capabilities in place for our customers. So we're investing through this cycle, looking at how to continue to grow the business. And again, we see the Lumen platform as exactly what our customers are needing to help them usher in the fourth industrial revolution, but really deal with the quantity and the amount and the distribution of data. We know that they want the advantages of being able to have compute resources within a few milliseconds of where that data is created, and so our edge compute capabilities. But we also know that they want to be able to transport that data to any cloud service provider, any software-as-a-service provider. And that's where our dynamic connections, which is essentially a network-as-a-service product, but our dynamic connections helps them.

If you look at our -- go back and look at our comments from last quarter, we said that we expect that it wouldn't last because a lot of the ramp up in volume was COVID related as folks started working from home, et cetera. But the key point is the environment that we're in needs more collaboration, and that is more traffic. So when folks there at their traditional voice networks and see a huge spike in volume, they figure out how do we support that in different ways, whether that traffic transitions to Microsoft's Teams or Zoom, et cetera. But there is an underlying need to upgrade their network infrastructure, and that's where we come in with a broad product portfolio. So we've been helping. So you'll see that transition within our portfolio in terms of more connectivity needs that customers need. Now it's not one-for-one, but it definitely drives demand for other products and services. And we will expect that to continue going forward as folks a trip off of legacy voice and into other infrastructure products. 
In terms of transport and infrastructure, there's -- for -- given the broad product portfolio that we have, in any given quarter, we'll see fluctuation in one versus the other. But in general, that sort of products are doing very well for us."

First of all, from this is third-party stuff, so you can take it however you take the third parties. It's estimated -- it's a broad range, but it's estimated to be somewhere between $10 billion and $40 billion worth of opportunity over the coming years. So we think it's big. 
What it means, though, is we've centralized computing for a very long time. Moved it into the cloud, which centralizes it even more. Moved it away from where that data is actually acquired. And what we see from enterprise customers is they need to move that compute resource back closer to where the data is acquired so that they can analyze and act on it faster without having to transport it around and move it around. And so I look at edge and think it gives the benefit of on-premise computing. We're very close. We can serve 95% of the U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds of delay. So we're very close to where that data has actually created and where it needs to be analyzed. So it gives the benefit of on-premise computing with also the benefits of cloud computing because we can move it into a cloud environment. They don't have to have their own data center. We can do it virtually. We can do it on physical machines. And we can do -- we can provide their compute resources in a variety of ways. And so if you look at the presentation on Slide 4, we can orchestrate for our customers and help them control their applications and operate their applications very close to where the data is created in a very efficient and effective way. So that's what edge really means. And our Lumen platform is focused on that. But our Lumen platform is focused on providing those capabilities, whether it's in the edge or in the network itself. So if you think about dynamic connections, dynamic connections is that network-as-a-service capability that I mentioned. If you're an edge compute customer and you want to redirect your compute resources from 1 data center to another, or 1 cloud provider to another, you can use that. If you're not an edge compute customer, but you're using other capabilities of Lumen, you can use that same capability to control your network in a very seamless, very effective way."

So I think your question on consumer broadband, I think what I would say is, if I just step back, we've been really focused on really improving the quality of the overall revenue base for consumer. And you can see that in our revenue numbers. Our revenue has been growing. And as Jeff mentioned, our ARPU has been growing. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that for 100 meg and above, we're now at 13% of the base is at that speed, compared to it was beginning of last year at about 5. So that part of that business where we're investing, and we know that's a very competitive asset, it's growing very fast, and we continue to invest in fiber. If you look at our average ARPU for that entire revenue base, it's in the mid-50s. And the new sales that we have at 100-plus meg is, at the very least, coming at 30% or more higher from a new sales perspective. So we'll continue to focus on improving ARPU. 
You layer on top of that, the CAF II subs that we have where we see a high penetration as we build and penetrate. And you layer on top of that, our rural subs, where there aren't a lot of alternatives. Overall, the quality of the revenue base keeps improving every quarter.

In terms of your question on the last recession, we've gone back and looked at it, but the reality is the environment today is very different.

And so it will be opportunistic from a consumer basis outside of our legacy LEC footprint and then obviously, inside our legacy footprint.

First of all, we believe the Lumen platform, riding on our deep and extensive fiber infrastructure positions us really well to help our customers navigate the fourth industrial revolution. We are investing in growing addressable markets that we believe will improve our revenue trajectory over time. Our capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our balance sheet, produce our interest expense and is aligned with our guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share. Our strong liquidity position enables us to invest through this cycle. And through all of this activity, our dividend remains in a very comfortable position with a payout ratio in the 30s.

After that, Neel will review our third quarter financial results, and then we will open up the call for your questions.
We delivered another solid quarter, improving our year-over-year revenue performance and delivering sequential EBITDA as we continue to transform our business. Customers rely on Lumen to enable their digital transformation, and we're seeing that in our sales trends. Following a strong second quarter, sales for IGAM and Enterprise segments were good, and sales for SMB customers were in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the steady demand we see, but expect sales cycles will continue to be affected by the uncertain environment particularly for SMB customers.
We delivered another strong quarter for consumer broadband revenue with both year-over-year and sequential revenue growth and recorded our 11th consecutive quarter of growth in broadband ARPU. This quarter, we added 46,000 gigabit subscribers, surpassing the record we set last quarter. Our results confirm our thesis for the Consumer business. We win customers where we invest in fiber, simplify the experience and use micro-targeting in selecting the areas we serve. We believe our consumer fiber offering is the best in the market, and our customer satisfaction results are showing consumers value dedicated and reliable bandwidth.
As you've heard me say many times, our operational improvements lead to highly satisfied customers, more durable revenue and they allow us to reduce the cost of our operations. Our relentless focus in these areas is delivering results you can see in 2 ways this quarter. First, despite higher seasonal expenses, we delivered sequential adjusted EBITDA growth. Second, we were recently recognized by Newsweek on their 2021 list of Top Customer Service Brands, scoring the highest of all named Internet service providers. We've made a lot of progress and see additional opportunities to improve.
Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter. We are focused on improving top line revenue and driving EBITDA growth. We also remain committed to the capital allocation strategy summarized on Slide 4 and the leverage targets we set at the beginning of last year.
Our first priority is to invest in the business, driving growth, transforming our customer experience and improving our operating costs. Our second objective is to reduce leverage, and we further strengthened the balance sheet this quarter through several capital market transactions, continuing to reduce both leverage and interest expense. Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and are very comfortable with a dividend payout ratio in the 30s, one of the lowest payout ratios compared to our large peers.
We believe the balance we achieved through this 3-pronged capital allocation has served us well through the COVID pandemic and the uncertainty in the economy, giving us ample liquidity to continue to invest for growth, reduce debt and return capital through our dividend. Within the company, our mostly work-from-home team continues to excel as a distributed workforce. We have maintained small dedicated teams to drive speed and collaboration on our key product and operational initiatives and continue to use data-oriented technologies to operate at the highest levels in service delivery and service assurance. In fact, we've been using this time and our own experience to understand and develop solutions for the fourth Industrial Revolution and a work-from-anywhere mindset.
Turning to the launch of Lumen. A couple years ago, we challenged ourselves to chart a bold vision for what kind of company we wanted to be. During that effort, it became obvious that the company was firmly in a position to successfully help our customers acquire, analyze and act on their data. Lumen does this through the use of applications securely delivered across a hybrid cloud, from massive data centers all the way to the edge. In that moment, Lumen was born with the goal of delivering the fastest, most secure platform for next-gen applications and data.
In September, we rebranded to Lumen Technologies to introduce this new vision to the market. Lumen is more than just a new name and logo. In a world that is rapidly changing, it signals a new era for our company where we combine an all-digital delivery model, software-defined networking and one of the very best fiber and network infrastructures into a platform of capabilities designed to drive our customers' success.
Although we've been in a rapidly changing industry for the past 30 years, with the advent of the fourth Industrial Revolution, the pace of change is accelerating. And I believe Lumen is uniquely positioned to enable and benefit from this rapid change. The Lumen platform, grounded on a broad, fiber-based foundation and delivering virtualized network, cloud, security and voice services, continues to be essential to customers as we see them augment their capabilities to support new work environments and emerging technologies.
Lumen's capabilities lie at the heart of enabling that demand. And as you can see on the Slide 5, the Lumen platform is designed to bring together all of our assets, IP, services and expertise to deliver the world-class experience customers expect from Lumen. We give our customers access to cloud edge facilities, hosting critical applications within 5 milliseconds of digital transactions, enabling IoT and other next-gen use cases; software-defined networks that can create new connections around the world in seconds; network-based threat intelligence that protects our customers' data and proactively stops malicious factors; and massive network infrastructure with long-haul fiber and IP networks, providing connectivity to private data centers, public data centers, cloud service providers, 5G operators and the array of global networks serving end users.
As amazing as our capabilities are today, we continue to invest to ensure our platform offers the fastest, most capable and resilient fiber-based services to support our customers' application and data needs. This approach enables us to deliver a continually improving platform that will help improve our revenue trajectory and take advantage of the growing addressable markets for these services.
I'm also very pleased with the pace at which we are simplifying and digitizing the way businesses purchase and consume their networking, cloud edge and security solutions from us. We are driving a digital-first culture that allows our customers to configure, order and rapidly deploy our services through an all-digital, self-service set of tools. We are certainly known for our fiber infrastructure, but over that infrastructure, we deliver digital services like Lumen Hyper WAN, Lumen Dynamic Connections, Lumen DDoS mitigation, that are completely transforming how we serve our customers, allowing them to consume our platform services in ways that are flexible and easy.
Beyond enabling fast, secure connections and simplifying our customer experience, Lumen is also enabling partners to use our platform to deliver best-of-breed capabilities while also speeding our time to market. As an example is our partnership with Zoom. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an explosion in demand for Internet-based collaboration services. Zoom is a market leader in this space as well as a longtime valued customer of Lumen. We are delighted our platform supports the amazing services they provide. In late September, we announced a new partnership to incorporate Zoom into Lumen's portfolio of voice and collaboration services and are excited by the early commercial traction we've already seen. Long term, we think we can develop enhanced customer experiences by further integrating Zoom's technology with the rich capabilities and deep reach of the Lumen platform.
The second example is the partnership we announced with VMware, a significant collaboration covering edge compute, networking and security. Utilizing the VMware SD-WAN by VeloCloud solution and the recently announced VMware secure access service edge platform, we have the ability to integrate VMware services to deliver a work-from-anywhere platform on our global edge infrastructure to create solutions for businesses of all sizes across a variety of industries.
As I've mentioned, customers need to move processing capabilities from remote data centers or the core of the cloud to the very edge of the network, close to where the data is generated. Whether providing bare metal as a service or full-blown edge computing resources, the cloud edge and network as a service capabilities of the Lumen platform are integrated into a single experience for the customer and deliver low latency connectivity to more than 95% of the U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds.  The edge computing market is forecasted to be anywhere from $10 billion to $40 billion over the next several years, and we are very focused on leveraging our widely distributed fiber and edge data facilities to aggressively pursue this opportunity.
I'm pleased to say that we're already making great progress on our cloud edge plans. We just turned up the first block of cloud edge nodes, and subsequent blocks are well underway. Even before we officially launched the product, a major media company began using our cloud edge platform to deliver live sporting events, and it is providing them exactly the capabilities and performance they hoped.
A very different type of enterprise customer already deploying on the Lumen cloud edge is CyberReef. CyberReef provides remote learning solutions for public school systems, and the COVID pandemic is driving tremendous growth for their services. CyberReef's Kids Internet Defense Shield required highly distributed compute resources combined with high-capacity network connections and deeply tiered Internet infrastructure, placing their security tools close to the school systems they support. In other words, Lumen's cloud edge platform and the Lumen network were a perfect fit for this customer and a great example of how high-performance networking combined with distributed compute can deliver next-generation services.
Lastly, in the quarter, we turned out our Lumen cloud edge experience center in Denver where customers, partners and vendors can remotely deploy edge compute technologies on our platform and test them with live networking under real-life conditions. Within a couple of days of the launch of the experience center, a major cloud service provider loaded their cloud extension software to begin testing, and we are working with other partners and customers to begin testing their applications as well. As a result and in partnership with multiple cloud service providers, software as a service providers and other key partners, we expect to deliver capabilities like artificial intelligence, machine learning and distributed analytics for enterprises over the Lumen platform.
As you can see on Slide 6, while Lumen is the name of our company and our flagship brand for serving enterprise and wholesale markets, we also launched Quantum Fiber. Quantum Fiber is our brand for serving fiber-based services to small business and consumer customers. And just as with Lumen enterprise customers, we're offering our Quantum customers a simplified, highly digital customer experience with expanded tools for managing the Quantum platform with mass market efficiency.
As we continue deploying Quantum Fiber services to the small business segment, we intend to utilize our more than 170,000 on-net, fiber-fed buildings as a starting point, targeting small businesses in tens of thousands of existing buildings. We know that bandwidth is critical for these customers, and our simple, resilient, all-digital Quantum services are well positioned to meet those needs. While Lumen's primary focus is enterprise, we have a dedicated leadership team whose sole focus is to leverage our Quantum investments to grow the consumer and small business markets.
Finally, the CenturyLink brand will remain in place for our consumer and small business customers who receive traditional services over traditional hybrid fiber copper networks.
As a quick recap, Lumen is more than just a new name. We are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and the work we've done over the past 2.5 years to capture that opportunity and to launch Lumen. As our customers embrace the fourth Industrial Revolution, the Lumen platform delivers adaptive, secure and resilient capabilities over one of the world's best fiber infrastructures. We are focused on enabling our customers' success and integrating those capabilities within their own operating environment. We are very excited about the future.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Neel. Neel?"

During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our plan and made substantial progress transforming and positioning the company for the future.

During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our plan and made substantial progress transforming and positioning the company for the future. As Jeff mentioned, we rebranded to Lumen and made a purposeful shift in aggressively going after emerging opportunities with growing addressable markets. We had solid third quarter results, which highlights the resilience and relevance of the products and services we offer particularly given the current backdrop of economic uncertainty.
I'll start with our financial summary on Slide 8. Total revenue performance improved compared to the year ago quarter. We had another quarter of steady progress on our cost transformation savings initiatives. While we incurred higher costs due to seasonally high utility expenses, a global brand launch and the cost and efficiencies of operating in the current environment, we grew adjusted EBITDA on a sequential basis. We continue to invest in the business while delivering solid free cash flow. During the quarter, we also made good progress on our deleveraging and refinancing initiatives.
Turning to revenue. On a year-over-year basis, total revenue declined 3.4% to $5.167 billion compared to a decline of 4.8% in the third quarter of 2019. Sequentially, total revenue declined 0.5%.
Moving to Slide 9. In revenue by business segment on a year-over-year basis, International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue declined 3.6% and declined 2.6% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by COVID resurgence and related weakness in our international business. On a sequential basis, IGAM declined 1.6% and 2.4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see good demand from a subset of our largest customers whose business models are benefiting from the current environment. However, during the quarter, we saw a reduced level of activity due to COVID in our international business, particularly across Europe and Latin America.
Moving to our Enterprise segment. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by 0.8%. This compares to a 0.9% increase in the third quarter of 2019. On a sequential basis, Enterprise grew 0.4%. Both sequential and year-over-year performance benefited from strength in our federal business and installs from sales earlier this year.
SMB revenue decreased 5.8% year-over-year primarily driven by continued declines in legacy voice services. As we have mentioned before, we expect COVID would likely have a disproportionate impact on this segment, and we continue to monitor this closely. In general, while we haven't seen an increase in churn, as you might expect, we have seen a decrease in sales both year-over-year and sequentially. Additionally, during the quarter within SMB, we sold our legacy correctional facility communications business. The sale of this business at the end of August impacted revenue by about $5 million in the third quarter and will have a full quarter impact of about $15 million in the fourth quarter.
Wholesale revenue decreased 6.7% year-over-year. This compares to an average decline of 7% over the prior 4 quarters. Sequentially, revenue was flat. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, we did see a benefit from a carrier settlement of approximately $15 million. In terms of products, this quarter, the trajectory of legacy voice revenue returned to pre-COVID levels. But as expected, customers are meeting that need for higher collaboration by transitioning volume and spend to our other connectivity products and services.
In summary, across our business groups and as we have all seen across the broader economy, the acceleration of the digital economy is impacting every business. While some are able to lean into it and we are seeing good demand from those customers, others are challenged in this environment and delaying buying decisions.
Turning to Consumer on Slide 10. For the third quarter 2020, revenue declined 4.1% year-over-year compared to 9.7% in the year ago quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue declined 0.5% primarily driven by ongoing legacy voice declines offset by growth in broadband.
Broadband revenue for the third quarter 2020 grew 1.7% year-over-year and 0.6% on a sequential basis. In the third quarter, in speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 62,000 subs. From a mix perspective, 13% of our total broadband subs now have greater than 100 meg speeds compared to 5% at the beginning of last year. We now have approximately 2.3 million homes passed with fiber compared to about 2 million at year-end 2019. As we have mentioned before, we expect that future performance will be largely driven by our execution around our fiber to the home investment strategy in driving up penetration of our competitive assets.
Our revenue performance has been driven by this focus on our competitive assets where we can support higher speeds, tend to have higher ARPU and generally see lower churn. Moreover, our digital customer experience initiatives will not only improve customer interactions but are expected to continue to improve the margin profile of our consumer broadband business. We also remain committed to supporting our customers that are working through the current economic uncertainty or who have participated in the Keep Americans Connected Pledge. As a reminder, those customers have been subtracted from our sub counts and were the primary driver of the change in low-speed sub counts this quarter.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 11. For the third quarter 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $2.190 billion compared to $2.261 billion in the third quarter 2019 and $2.174 billion in the second quarter of 2020. Despite a global brand rollout, seasonally higher utility costs and COVID-related inefficiencies, as a result of our focus on profitable revenues and cost transformation initiatives, we grew adjusted EBITDA sequentially.
Specific to bad debt, our expense this quarter was down $10 million sequentially and roughly $15 million higher than pre-COVID levels. Our DSOs have been relatively stable, and we continue to work closely with our customers on payment arrangements. Given our current experience, we expect our bad debt expense to continue to decrease sequentially to pre-COVID levels.
Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 42.4% compared to 42.3% in the year ago quarter. As of the end of the third quarter, we achieved approximately $730 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings compared to $620 million as of the end of the previous quarter.
Given the challenges related to COVID, we continue to be pleased with the run rate savings we achieved this year. We also remain confident in our 3-year transformation plans, and we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings.
Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the third quarter of 2020 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $78 million and free cash flow by $111 million. For the third quarter 2020, capital expenditures were $988 million. This compares to third quarter 2019 CapEx of $957 million.
We are investing in the products and services that support the Lumen platform. We also continue to invest in expanding our fiber footprint and our digital customer and employee experience. In the third quarter of 2020, the company generated free cash flow of $917 million. This compares to free cash flow of $983 million in the third quarter 2019.
Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 12. During the third quarter, we paid down $550 million in debt obligations and refinanced $2 billion of debt at lower rates. We have refinanced $19 billion since we announced the deleveraging plan last year and reduced and extended maturities through 2025 by around $15 billion. We remain focused on getting to our target leverage ratio of 2.75 to 3.25x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.
As we move to our financial outlook on Slide 13, we continue to see uncertainty as the level of impact and buyer behaviors vary widely across our very diverse customer base. Over the long term, we think the demand dynamics and the acceleration of the digital economy is net positive for our business. However, in the short term, we will likely see customers being cautious as they work through their return-to-work plans.
Despite the overall market uncertainty, we are optimistic about the resilience of our business and for the fourth quarter, we expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from $2.19 billion this quarter. Additionally, given continued progress in our deleveraging initiatives and aided by current market conditions, we are lowering and narrowing our cash interest expense to a range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion from our previous range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. Our net cash interest expense this year is expected to be about $500 million lower compared to 2018.
To summarize, our results continue to highlight that our business and the products we sell are resilient. We are delivering strong bottom line results while we are leaning in and investing to improve our revenue trajectory. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong and are continually improving. We continue to execute on our capital allocation policy we laid out early last year. We are investing to position the company for the future, deleveraging to our target leverage range of 2.75 to 3.25x and returning over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend with a payout ratio that we continue to expect to be in the 30s as a percentage of free cash flow.
With that, we'll open it up for your questions. France, will you please explain the process?"

So in terms of fourth quarter, obviously, we've had a good quarter for our cost transformation savings. And so we expect that to continue going into fourth quarter, and offsetting some of that savings are some of the investments that we're making. So we are making -- you've seen us spend a little bit more on capital. We have, similarly, investment in the brand and investment in our products and services, a lot of which Jeff touched on in his remarks. Utilities will come down, which is seasonal. We expect bad debt to continue to come down. And the remainder will be driven by our performance on revenue.  So at a high level, that's kind of the primary drivers from a sequential EBITDA performance standpoint.
From year-over-year, we did see good improvement in revenue, like I mentioned, 3.4% versus the 4.8%. We have a good funnel, and we feel good about the quarter. But the only thing that we're a little cautious about is some of the resurgence we're seeing and how that impacts customer activity."

So we don't really see any limitations in terms of the savings that we can achieve over the next handful of years.
In terms of your question on Keep America Connected -- Americans Connected, what we're doing is really for the non-pay customers, we're working closely with them. We're reserving the revenue, and you don't see it in our units either. So incrementally, it impacted our units by about 35,000 units."

So as we couple the Lumen platform with one of the world's best fiber infrastructures, we think those capabilities are very relevant going forward, very important to our customers. And this near-term uncertainty, we'll get passed."

One of the things that we're very pleased about is, is that as a result of some of the decisions we've made over the last couple of years, we're in a great position to keep investing. So if you look at our cloud edge strategy, we're deeply investing that. Neel referenced in one of his answers a minute ago that we're investing in people. We have hundreds of people dedicated to cloud edge to make sure that we have the right capabilities in place for our customers. So we're investing through this cycle, looking at how to continue to grow the business.
And again, we see the Lumen platform as exactly what our customers are needing to help them usher in the fourth Industrial Revolution, but really deal with the quantity and the amount and the distribution of data. We know that they want the advantages of being able to have compute resources within a few milliseconds of where that data is created, and so our edge compute capabilities. But we also know that they want to be able to transport that data to any cloud service provider, any software as a service provider.
And that's where our Dynamic Connections, which is essentially a network as a service product, but our Dynamic Connections helps them. And so from a going-forward perspective, we think that the products, the capabilities that we're layering on top of the great fiber and network infrastructure that we have in place today really position us to grow revenue, and we'll continue to focus on that."

But the important thing to keep in mind is that as you can see with our sequential EBITDA growth, that these are not net incremental. We're offsetting that with other savings. So similarly, on the branding front, we're not going to slow down. We're going to continue to invest in the brand for next several quarters probably at similar levels, but we'll be offsetting that with savings elsewhere. So that's been our approach.
In terms of the products, it's mostly installs. There's always a little bit of onetimes and settlements in Wholesale and in other -- especially in the Wholesale segment. So there are some fluctuations driven by that."

So when folks stare at their traditional voice networks and see a huge spike in volume, they figure out how to support that in different ways, whether that traffic transitions to Microsoft's Teams or Zoom, et cetera. But there is an underlying need to upgrade their network infrastructure, and that's where we come in with a broad product portfolio.
So we've been helping. So you'll see that transition within our portfolio in terms of more connectivity needs that customers need. Now it's not one-for-one, but it definitely drives demand for other products and services. And we would expect that to continue going forward as folks [ trip off ] of legacy voice and into other infrastructure products. In terms of transport and infrastructure, there's -- for -- given the broad product portfolio that we have, in any given quarter, we'll see fluctuation in one versus the other.

First of all, from -- this is third-party stuff, so you can take it however you take third parties. It's estimated -- it's a broad range, but it's estimated to be somewhere between $10 billion and $40 billion worth of opportunity over the coming yea",393,"Sure. First of all, from -- this is third-party stuff, so you can take it however you take third parties. It's estimated -- it's a broad range, but it's estimated to be somewhere between $10 billion and $40 billion worth of opportunity over the coming years. So we think it's big. What it means, though, is we've centralized computing for a very long time; moved it into the cloud, which centralizes it even more; moved it away from where that data is actually acquired. And what we see from enterprise customers is they need to move that compute resource back closer to where that data is acquired so that they can analyze and act on it faster without having to transport it around and move it around.
And so I look at edge and think it gives the benefit of on-premise computing. We're very close -- we can serve 95% of the U.S. enterprises within 5 milliseconds of delay. So we're very close to where that data is actually created and where it needs to be analyzed. So it gives the benefit of on-premise computing with also the benefits of cloud computing because we can move it into a cloud environment. They don't have to have their own data center. We can do it virtually. We can do it on physical machines. We can do -- we can provide their compute resources in a variety of ways.
And so if you look at the presentation on Slide 4, we can orchestrate for our customers and help them control their applications and operate their applications very close to where the data is created in a very efficient and effective way. So that's what edge really means, and our Lumen platform is focused on that. But our Lumen platform is focused on providing those capabilities, whether it's in an edge or in the network itself.
So if you think about Dynamic Connections, Dynamic Connections is that network as a service capability that I mentioned. If you're an edge compute customer and you want to redirect your compute resources from one data center to another or one cloud provider to another, you can use that. If you're not an edge compute customer but you're using other capabilities of Lumen, you can use that same capability to control your network in a very seamless, very effective way."

So I think your question on consumer broadband, I think what I would say is if I just step back, we've been really focused on really improving the quality of the overall revenue base for consumer.

And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that for 100 meg and above, we're now at 13% of the base is at that speed compared to it was beginning of last year at about 5%. So that part of that business is where we're investing, and we know that's a very competitive asset. It's growing very fast. And we continue to invest in fiber. If you look at our average ARPU for that entire revenue base, it's in the mid-50s. And the new sales that we have at 100-plus meg is, at the very least, coming at 30% or more -- higher from a new sales perspective. So we'll continue to focus on improving ARPU.
You layer on top of that the CAF II subs that we have where we see a high penetration as we build and penetrate and you layer on top of that our rural subs where there aren't a lot of alternatives, overall, the quality of the revenue base keeps improving every quarter. So we'll continue to focus on that and continue to focus on improving the revenue trajectory.

Can you remind us when you expect to be a full taxpayer? And a little bit more high level. As you invest to grow and transform the business, can you provide a bit more color on our starting point for the revenue mix? Do you still look at the current mix today as a certain mix coming from legacy products and will continue to decline, but you are investing in new capabilities which is growing substantially? Where are we in terms of that percent mix difference?
And also, as you look at your new segments, can you talk a little bit about how the network cost will be allocated between these segments? Do they stand on their own? Or do they -- will they have a shared infrastructure?"

Yes, we don't expect to be a material taxpayer for the next 2 to 3 years. So we have the NOLs there. So yes, that's the outlook right now.

So we have the NOLs there. So yes, that's the outlook right now. In terms of revenue mix, the dynamic you described is absolutely right. We will continue to see erosion in legacy products, and that will continue. But what we are doing is given the infrastructure that we have, the fiber and infrastructure that we have, we're investing in products and services with closed affinity to that infrastructure that leverages that infrastructure, all the things that Jeff described with emerging, growing addressable market opportunities that we hope to gain good traction on that will be a different vector in terms of driving our revenue performance going forward. So that then, in essence, is what we're focused on. In terms of the segments, we'll give that more thought in terms of how we report next year, and we'll have more to say on our fourth quarter earnings call."

How big can Quantum get in terms of revenue? What's sort of the TAM there? Is that mostly an ILEC footprint strategy? Or is it also out of footprint?

Without getting into specific TAMs, it's a strategy in footprint and out of footprint, where we have the ability to win and where we have the ability to build infrastructure. So if you think out of footprint for consumer, MDUs are natural for us. We'",308,"Yes. Without getting into specific TAMs, it's a strategy in footprint and out of footprint, where we have the ability to win and where we have the ability to build infrastructure. So if you think out of footprint for consumer, MDUs are natural for us. We've done some work with cities that are outside our footprint to grow networks with them. And so it will be opportunistic from a consumer basis outside of our legacy LEC footprint and then obviously, inside our legacy LEC footprint.
If you look at Quantum from a business -- small business perspective, that's both. That's looking in the legacy LEC networks and the customers that we serve there, and it's looking at the -- all the buildings that we have that are let and could be let to provide services to those customers. So it's a little bit a mixed bag between the 2.
All right. Thanks for the last question. And thank you, everyone, for your questions actually. And before we conclude the call today, I'll summarize with a few thoughts about the future of Lumen.
First of all, we believe the Lumen platform, riding on our deep and extensive fiber infrastructure, positions us really well to help our customers navigate the fourth Industrial Revolution. We are investing in growing addressable markets that we believe will improve our revenue trajectory over time. Our capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our balance sheet, reduce our interest expense and is aligned with our guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share. Our strong liquidity position enables us to invest through this cycle. And through all of this activity, our dividend remains in a very comfortable position with a payout ratio in the 30s.
I appreciate everybody joining the call today, and thank you for your interest in Lumen. Operator, that concludes the call."
