While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you'll have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead. 
Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and, of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. While the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while. 
So now on to the first quarter. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, above the midpoint of guidance. 
Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin, and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500. 
On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority 1 is the efficient use of our capital. The first call on our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D, with more than 90% of the spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here, we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad market and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong, and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders as we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend. 
Priority 2 is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them early in order to solve their toughest challenges. 
And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now. Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, [indiscernible] became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate our A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities while increasing our SAM per vehicle. 
There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving towards electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market, partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. 
In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production, and new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate. 
Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center. Now, today, I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure subsegment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management. Space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. 
While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, it [ commands ] stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next 5 years. 
Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20x. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low earth or real communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecast suggesting that by 2020, over 20,000 will be involved, up from just hundreds today. 
To provide some context, [indiscernible] satellites differ from today's geostationary or geo satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously changed their position relative to the earth and always stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they're on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of [indiscernible] satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being [indiscernible]. So this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. 
And as you can imagine, more channels backed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always connected [indiscernible] network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed, a key system architect. 
So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna bits, combined with power capabilities, to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs as well as the next wave of disruptors. 
All told, we see the [indiscernible] communication satellite plan becoming at least 4x the size of geo over the next 5 years. And with [indiscernible] refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead. 
In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these [indiscernible] networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally, assuring an opportunity from autonomous driving to [indiscernible]. 
So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and, indeed, strong shareholder returns. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. ADI delivered a",1069,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high end of our target range of 7% to 15%. 
The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business. 
Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double digits year-over-year. Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind. 
Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. 
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we've curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past 5 quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx. 
Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. 
All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers. 
We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the [ first ] quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or a free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020. 
Now we'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates. 
So looking ahead to Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid- to high single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications. 
Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08. 
While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism. We are encouraged by near-term trend that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI. 
Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24 gigahertz radar technology is declining probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected and also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investments 3 or 4 years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out, I think, on those headwinds, specific to safety. We have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24 gigahertz radar decline.

We are seeing, as I said, a little earlier on the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on a, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector. 
So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we're -- we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector, and we will get, I think, a decent increase in our top line in industrial during the second quarter. 
On the wireline side of things, our game there is really 2 pieces. We have a very strong -- we have a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the [indiscernible], for example, would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain. And also the cable market, we have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high single digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI. It runs into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company."

As we move forward from here, we see 2 things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix. So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption in our internal manufacturing facilities, that gets better from here on, and that will be a tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial. We expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward. And industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses, so that will also provide tailwind. 
So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the year."

We expect that to begin unwinding in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter. Could it be above normal, that's certainly a possibility, depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that, that is purely a timing shift that, that is not lock demand.

The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here.

While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you'll have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.
Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and, of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. While the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.
So now on to the first quarter. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, above the midpoint of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin, and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.
On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority 1 is the efficient use of our capital. The first call on our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D, with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here, we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad market and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong, and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders and we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.
Priority 2 is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them early in order to solve their toughest challenges.
And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now. Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate our A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities while increasing our SAM per vehicle.
There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving towards electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market, partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production, and new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.
Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center. Now today I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure subsegment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management. Space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, it commands stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next 5 years.
Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20x. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low Earth orbit or LEO communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecasts suggesting that by 2020, over 20,000 will be in orbit, up from just hundreds today.
To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or geo satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously changed their position relative to the earth and only stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they're on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being [ steered ]. So this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always-connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed, a key system architect.
So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits, combined with power capabilities, to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs as well as the next wave of disruptors. All told, we see the LEO communications satellite plan becoming at least 4x the size of geo over the next 5 years. And with LEO's [ shorter ] refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead.
In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally, ushering in opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.
So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and, indeed, strong shareholder returns.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.ADI delivered a",1067,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high end of our target range of 7% to 15%.
The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.
Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double digits year-over-year.
Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind.
Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. 
And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment.
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we've curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past 5 quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx.
Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers.
We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the first quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or a free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.
Now we'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates.
So looking ahead to Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid- to high single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications.
Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08.
While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism. We are encouraged by near-term trends that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.
Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

The 2 growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B, active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general. And of course, BMS has been over the last couple of years, a double-digit growth driver for ADI. I think in the quarter just passed, BMS, which has a route -- a strong route in China that suffered as a result of the virus. And -- but when we look into the second quarter, we expect our -- as I said, our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter.
The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investment 3 or 4 years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out, I think, on those headwinds, specific to safety. We have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24-gigahertz radar decline.
So my sense is in the areas we've picked of powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well positioned to grow those sectors over the next 2, 3, 4 years."

So we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said a little earlier on, the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on a, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector.
So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we're -- we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector, and we will get, I think, a decent increase in our top line in industrial during the second quarter.
On the wireline side of things, our game there is really 2 pieces. We have a very strong -- we have a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the FANGs, for example, would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain and also the cable market. We have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high single digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI. It runs into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company."

As we move forward from here, we see 2 things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix.
So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption in our internal manufacturing facilities, that gets better from here on, and that will be tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial. We expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward. And industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses, so that will also provide tailwind.
So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the year."

We expect that to begin unwinding in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter.
Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility. It depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that, that is purely a timing shift that, that is not lock demand. But as to when that falls back in, it's hard to say, but the order activity certainly suggests that it's not going away."

The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as -- is it caught up in the year or not?

While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you'll have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.
Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and, of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. While the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.
So now on to the first quarter. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, above the midpoint of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin, and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.
On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority 1 is the efficient use of our capital. The first call on our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D, with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here, we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad market and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong, and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders and we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.
Priority 2 is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them early in order to solve their toughest challenges.
And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now. Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate our A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities while increasing our SAM per vehicle.
There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving towards electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market, partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production, and new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.
Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center. Now today I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure subsegment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management. Space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, it commands stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next 5 years.
Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20x. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low Earth orbit or LEO communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecasts suggesting that by 2020, over 20,000 will be in orbit, up from just hundreds today.
To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or geo satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously change their position relative to the earth and only stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they're on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being steered. But so this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always-connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed, a key system architect.
So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits, combined with power capabilities, to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs as well as the next wave of disruptors. All told, we see the LEO communications satellite plan becoming at least 4x the size of geo over the next 5 years. And with LEO's shorter refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead.
In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally, ushering in opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.
So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and, indeed, strong shareholder returns.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."
251411,652312831,1918739,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2020",2020-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.ADI delivered a",1067,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high end of our target range of 7% to 15%.
The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.
Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double digits year-over-year.
Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind.
Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. 
And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment.
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we've curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past 5 quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx.
Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers.
We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the first quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or a free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.
Now we'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates.
So looking ahead to Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid- to high single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications.
Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08.
While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism. We are encouraged by near-term trends that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.
Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

The 2 growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B, active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general. And of course, BMS has been, over the last couple of years, a double-digit growth driver for ADI. I think in the quarter just passed, BMS, which has a route -- a strong route in China, suffered as a result of the virus. And -- but when we look into the second quarter, we expect our -- as I said, our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter.
The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investment 3 or 4 years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out, I think, on those headwinds, specific to safety. We have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24-gigahertz radar decline.
So my sense is in the areas we've picked of powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well positioned to grow those sectors over the next 2, 3, 4 years."

So we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said a little earlier on, the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector.
So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we're -- we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector, and we will get, I think, a decent increase in our top line in industrial during the second quarter.
On the wireline side of things, our game there is really 2 pieces. We have a very strong -- we have a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the FANGs, for example, would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain and also the cable market, we have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high single digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI. It runs into the region of $400 million annually in terms of sales at the present time. So I view that very much, Ambrish, as a tailwind for the company."

As we move forward from here, we see 2 things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix.
So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption in our internal manufacturing facilities, that gets better from here on, and that will be tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial. We expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward. And industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses, so that will also provide tailwind.
So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the year."

We expect that to begin unwinding in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter.
Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility. It depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that, that is purely a timing shift that, that is not lock demand. But as to when that falls back in, it's hard to say, but the order activity certainly suggests that it's not going away."

The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as -- is it caught up in the year or not?

While our first quarter results were in line with our expectations, as you'll have seen, importantly, we managed our operating costs and working capital effectively to position ourselves to deliver margin expansion in the quarters ahead.
Before I discuss the quarterly highlights, I'd like to address the coronavirus outbreak. First and foremost, our top priority is the health and safety of those affected and, of course, our employees. We're doing everything we can to provide our customers with the support they need to minimize disruption to their businesses. While the situation remains fluid, we are monitoring it closely. Prashanth will expand on the financial implications in just a while.
So now on to the first quarter. Revenue was $1.3 billion, down versus the prior year, but in line with our expectations. Operating margin was approximately 37%, a decline versus last year due to lower revenue and our decision to lower utilization. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, above the midpoint of guidance. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated approximately $2 billion of free cash flow, equating to a 35% free cash flow margin, and this continues to place us in the top 10% of the S&P 500.
On our call last quarter, we shared our priorities for 2020, and I'd like to give you an update on our progress so far. Priority 1 is the efficient use of our capital. The first call on our capital is funding new product development activities. In the first quarter, we invested over $250 million in R&D, with more than 90% of this spend targeting the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. For example, an area of increased focus for ADI is our power franchise. Here, we've been increasing R&D to enhance our strong position in the broad market and to extend into new opportunities across areas like data center, automotive and 5G infrastructure. Our power design win momentum remains strong, and we expect to double the LTC historical revenue growth rates in the years ahead of us. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering strong shareholder returns. In the first quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders and we just announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend.
Priority 2 is deepening customer centricity. As I've shared before, the combination of our broad product portfolio, domain expertise and manufacturing capabilities sets ADI apart. We're always anticipating the technology needs of our customers and engaging with them early in order to solve their toughest challenges.
And I'd like to share just a few examples specific to our automotive segment with you now. Our A2B platform continues to gain traction in the cabin electronics ecosystem. By leveraging our platform portfolio, we're opening up new applications for our customers such as active noise cancellation. In the quarter, Hyundai became the 14th auto manufacturer to incorporate our A2B technology. And together, we announced the industry's first all-digital road noise cancellation system. With the rise of active noise cancellation, we're creating stickier customer relationships due to the integration of our hardware and software capabilities while increasing our SAM per vehicle.
There's also a lot of intensity and urgency in OEMs moving towards electric powertrains. We were an early player in the market, partnering with industry leaders to improve the efficiency of the battery in electric vehicles. As a result, our BMS solutions are delivering greater miles per charge and monitoring battery health more accurately. In the U.S. electric vehicle market, we're benefiting from near-term strength as customers ramp production, and new design wins across future models will help us to deliver on our long-term objective of growing BMS revenue at a double-digit rate.
Priority 3 is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. We've previously discussed with you key secular trends across our company such as 5G, electric vehicles, factory automation and data center. Now today I'd like to spend some time on the space market, perhaps a more obscure subsegment of our industrial sector. Our space customers' challenges are not just around RF, signal processing and power management. Space solutions must also perform under extreme cosmic radiation and conditions of high temperatures. We solve these challenges through the combination of our comprehensive product portfolio and the passive knowledge base built over many decades of serving this market. While space represents a couple of percent of ADI's total revenue today, it commands stellar margins, and we see potential to double the business over the next 5 years.
Now let me share a little more with you about why this sector is exciting to us. The space market is rapidly evolving. Over the last decade, unprecedented levels of capital have gravitated towards this vertical, thereby increasing the number of privately funded space companies by 20x. Therefore, new technologies and capabilities are emerging that are leading to new opportunities for ADI. This includes the advent of low Earth orbit or LEO communication satellites. These satellites are becoming the new frontier in space with forecasts suggesting that by 2020, over 20,000 will be in orbit, up from just hundreds today.
To provide some context, LEO satellites differ from today's geostationary or geo satellites. Technologically, they provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, which enable real-time communication. Operationally, they continuously change their position relative to the earth and only stay connected with a given terminal for approximately 10 minutes. As a result, the number of terrestrial terminals that communicate with these satellites, whether they're on the ground or in the air, will grow into the millions with the proliferation of LEO satellites. To succeed in creating this network, both satellites and terminals must be capable of being steered. But so this requires an exponential increase in channel count enabled through phased array antennas, an architecture that is used in 5G networks already today. And as you can imagine, more channels packed into smaller form factors is increasing thermal and power hurdles. To help solve the engineering challenges of creating this ubiquitous and always-connected LEO network, our customers are increasingly turning to ADI, looking to us to not only be a supplier, but indeed, a key system architect.
So we're engaging with customers early in their design process to develop end-to-end solutions from antenna to bits, combined with power capabilities, to deliver the required performance and, of course, robustness. Our ability to provide a comprehensive portfolio of space-grade solutions across the entire analog spectrum from RF and signal chain to power is unique. And this cannot be completely replicated by any of our competitors, making ADI the go-to supplier for our traditional OEMs as well as the next wave of disruptors. All told, we see the LEO communications satellite plan becoming at least 4x the size of geo over the next 5 years. And with LEO's shorter refresh cycle compared to today's satellites, we expect our space business to deliver a steadier stream of revenue in the years ahead.
In summary, space has the potential to be a meaningful growth driver and unlock value across other verticals as well. Once fully operational, these LEO networks will provide real-time, reliable high-speed connections globally, ushering in opportunities from autonomous driving to telesurgery.
So in closing, and speaking broadly about ADI, I believe demand for our solutions will be unprecedented as technological innovation underpinned by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale and edge computing and pervasive connectivity continues to grow rapidly. And as I look ahead, I believe we're very well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and, indeed, strong shareholder returns.
So with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.ADI delivered a",1067,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses, will be on an adjusted basis which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
ADI delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue came in line with our outlook as we meaningfully reduced channel inventory. And through our disciplined spending, operating margin and EPS were above the midpoint of guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.62, an increase of 15%, the high end of our target range of 7% to 15%.
The dividend is the cornerstone of our capital allocation policy, and this represents the 17th increase over the last 16 years. These consistent increases reflect our commitment to strong shareholder returns as well as our optimism about the long-term prospects for our business.
Before getting into the income statement, let me first cover the end markets. In line with our expectations, our first quarter B2B revenue declined 15% year-over-year as better-than-expected industrial demand was balanced by softer communications activity. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, declined 7% year-over-year. As we forecasted, most applications within this highly diversified business declined, while aerospace and defense once again grew double digits year-over-year.
Communications, which represents 18% of revenue during the quarter, decreased 31% year-over-year as wireless and wired both declined. While communications is an inherently lumpy market, our position has never been stronger or more balanced across the ecosystem. We are at the early stages of the global 5G rollout, which we continue to expect will be a multiyear tailwind.
Our auto business, which represented 16% of revenues during the quarter, declined 16% year-over-year due to weakness across all applications. As Vince highlighted, we remain confident in auto due to our strong pipeline of customer wins, especially in our infotainment platform and our market-leading BMS position. 
And lastly, consumer, which represents 13% of revenue during the first quarter, declined 20% due to portable applications. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment.
Now on to the P&L. Gross margin came in at 68.5%, up slightly sequentially and down 180 basis points year-over-year as favorable mix was offset by lower utilization. As a reminder, fab utilization was near trough levels this quarter in order to reduce our balance sheet and our channel inventories. OpEx in the quarter was $412 million, down 4% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. In light of the softer revenue environment, we've curtailed spending and have delivered sequential OpEx declines in each of the past 5 quarters. As a reminder, we plan to exit fiscal 2020 with $50 million of annualized savings across cost of goods sold and OpEx.
Operating margin finished at approximately 37%, above the guided midpoint. Non-op expenses were $47 million, down $3 million sequentially and $9 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 12%. All told, first quarter adjusted EPS came in above the midpoint of guide at $1.03.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. As we planned, inventory was reduced by about $20 million or 4% sequentially. Despite this reduction, our inventory days increased to 133 due to the lower level of revenue. Recall that our target for inventory days is 115 to 125. But during the process of closing 2 legacy LTC facilities, we do expect to carry an additional 5 to 10 days of bridge inventory to support our customers.
We also reduced channel inventory by approximately $40 million in the first quarter and plan to reduce channel inventory in the second quarter again but to a lesser degree. CapEx in the quarter was $55 million or about 4% of revenue, and we expect to end fiscal 2020 slightly below our 4% long-term target. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $2 billion or a free cash flow margin of about 35%. Over this period, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after debt repayments. We paid approximately $200 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million of our stock in the first quarter. We still plan to pay down between $300 million to $500 million of debt in fiscal 2020.
Now we'll provide some context on our recent business trends and our current view on the coronavirus. In the first quarter, we saw signs of stabilization as we expected. Orders trended better throughout the quarter and have overall remained relatively resilient into the second quarter. However, unsurprisingly, we have begun to see weaker demand in China related to the extended Chinese New Year and ongoing business disruption. As such, our outlook assumes that China demand for industrial, automotive and consumer is minimal for all of February before returning to a more normal level in the last 2 months of our second quarter. And we are assuming an impact on our communications business due to the high likelihood of a delay in the 5G rollout. So while forecasting business dynamics in China is very difficult today, our guidance reflects our best estimates.
So looking ahead to Q2, revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $50 million. This includes an approximately $70 million revenue reduction due to the near-term risks with -- associated with the coronavirus. And as I said earlier, we expect to reduce channel inventory again but to a much lesser degree than in the first quarter. At the midpoint of $1.35 billion, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase mid- to high single digits sequentially with growth across all of our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications.
Based on the midpoint of guidance, op margin is expected to be up sequentially to approximately 37.5%. We are planning for our tax rate to be between 10% and 12% for the quarter, and we are improving our fiscal 2020 outlook to between 11% and 13%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.10, plus or minus $0.08.
While we are mindful of the uncertainty around this, I echo Vince's optimism. We are encouraged by near-term trends that point to a stabilization and improvement across end markets, and we are extremely confident in the long-term growth opportunities for ADI.
Let me give it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

And also, I pointed out that wireline for ADI in general, whether it's data center, whether it's metro or long-haul networks, is doing quite well. So as we've come into the second quarter, our book-to-bill has been -- is well above 1, and that gives us the confidence in the growing strength of that business through the second quarter here."

The 2 growth drivers for ADI in the automotive sector are the infotainment area, A2B, active noise cancellation, audio signal processing in general.

I think in the quarter just passed, BMS, which has a route -- a strong route in China, suffered as a result of the virus. And -- but when we look into the second quarter, we expect our -- as I said, our second quarter has better trends in North America and Europe. So we're expecting modest growth in the second quarter.
The headwind for ADI has really been the safety sector where our 24-gigahertz radar technology is declining, probably at a rate a little faster than I had expected. And also in the area of MEMS, more of the kind of the passive safety MEMS where we withdrew investment 3 or 4 years ago. So I think we'll begin to bottom out, I think, on those headwinds, specific to safety. We have a new safety modality in 77 gigahertz, which is, by all accounts, very, very exciting for our customers. We will see bottoming, I think, of the MEMS and the 24-gigahertz radar decline.
So my sense is in the areas we've picked of powertrain, infotainment, we're very, very well positioned to grow those sectors over the next 2, 3, 4 years."

So we are seeing our aerospace and defense business continue to grow at double-digit rates annually. We are seeing, as I said a little earlier on, the factory automation side of things outside of Asia is on, I'd say, a solid improvement in its demand pattern. I think inventory hangover has largely been taken out of the equation in the industrial sector.
So I think when you look -- when we look at the impact of the virus in China, we're not expecting really anything in the industrial sector in terms of shipments there for the month of February. But all that said, we're -- we have a very solid book-to-bill in the industrial sector, and we will get, I think, a decent increase in our top line in industrial during the second quarter.
On the wireline side of things, our game there is really 2 pieces. We have a very strong -- we have a strong leadership position in optical control systems for data centers. So all of the FANGs, for example, would use our technology in their data centers for control of the optical signal chain and also the cable market, we have a good position there in infrastructure systems. So wireline business has been growing high single digits now for several years, and I don't see any decline in that. I think that will be a decent growth driver for ADI.

As we move forward from here, we see 2 things that are going to be impacting margins, both utilization and mix.
So Q1 represented the trough level of our utilization expectations for the year. So a fair amount of under absorption in our internal manufacturing facilities, that gets better from here on, and that will be tailwind to margins. And also as some of the questions that were asked, Vince mentioned the strength in industrial. We expect industrial to continue to be growing as we move forward. And industrial, in general, is one of our highest margin businesses, so that will also provide tailwind.
So we -- I would expect that you could see sequential improvement in gross margins through the balance of this year likely getting back to our model margins in the second half, maybe towards the end of the year."

We expect that to begin unwinding in the subsequent months and certainly be back to normal in the third quarter.
Could it be above normal? That's certainly a possibility. It depends on the timing of how that $70 million comes back. It's our current view that, that is purely a timing shift that, that is not lock demand.

The sequential increase is below our initial expectations because of the -- a lot of that was related to 5G timing in China. So I think everything is moving a little bit to the right here. So it's hard for us to say at this point whether the timing of that recovery is still going to put us up year-on-year, but I think we'll have to see how quickly this demand recovers and whether the installations happen as -- is it caught up in the year or not?

Thank you also very, very much. 
When we had our last earnings call in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depths of the COVID-19 impact in China. And since then, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, putting tremendous stress in society and, of course, the global economy. 
To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity, whenever that may be. While our sector is not immune to the rent operating environment, it's my belief that technology will be what modifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still, we've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position. And we are learning from this challenging period and adapting quickly while still investing to ensure that we are well positioned in the recovery and for the long term. 
Our team has embraced the challenges with many of our employees working from home, but obviously, not everyone can work remotely, and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees who've continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing and enhanced sanitization. And we provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time. 
Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our health care solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our health care customers. And I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we've shown in rising to this critical challenge. 
Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multimillion-dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. But our work goes beyond financial contributions. We're also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions, such as rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical-grade patient monitoring that leverage our technologies. 
So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted, and to date, we have seen a deterioration in demand within our automotive, broad-based industrial and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis, to that end, health care demand at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed, wireline sectors. We're also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business. 
Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high performance analog, power and RF and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets. 
So now let me move to the other side of the equation and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted when many governments ordered shelter-in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end test and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly, yet responsibly to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world. 
Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original rate we provided on our first quarter earnings call, underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop. 
Now as we've mobilized preserve ADI strength in the near term, we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long term. Our team remains focused on our 3 strategic priorities, let me provide you with a brief update on each. 
First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. 
Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several black swan events successfully by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. 
We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns, with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs. And while COVID-19 has brought new challenges, it has also reviewed new opportunities in a reordered world. 
During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to reimagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high-performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle. 
And in our instrumentation test business for data center compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog mixed-signal and power micromodule portfolios. These solutions deliver 4x the channel density while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just 2 examples, there are many more across all of our markets. It's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic. 
Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common. That is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and activity more than ever. And new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. ADI, where the data is born, is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities. And I wanted to share some thoughts with you today. 
As I noted earlier, our health care business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast-track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, health care systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing and cloud capabilities is going to be required, and we believe that ADI's technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation. 
The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, and more people work remotely, transact business more digitally and consume media from everywhere. Here, ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required for an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next-generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size and power needs, positioning us to gain share and to capture additional value. 
Another secular trend we're benefiting from is the rise of Industry 4.0. Now while this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' minds. It's clear that post pandemic, supply chains will be reimagined, and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated and perhaps sovereign. To serve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain and power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software IO, depth sensing, condition-based monitoring and robust connectivity. 
Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive corporate responsibility report entitled Engineering Good. And I can assure you there will be more to come as I'm deeply committed to ADI's leadership here. 
So in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very, very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today, this unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We're embracing these short-term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talent, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.",1240,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Back in March, we withdrew our guidance for the second quarter as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However, we acted quickly and decisively, and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance, with revenue of $1.32 billion, operating margin of 38% and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings or approximately $50 million higher. 
So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets, while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19, performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially. And if not for supply constraints, we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid- to high single digits sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by $60 million in the quarter. 
Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our health care, memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period. 
Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially, and given the tough compare, decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long term, will be a high-growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems. 
Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly, our auto business was impacted by low vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. 
Lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. 
Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin came in at 67.7%, down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize $100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021 through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. 
OpEx was $390 million, down 5% sequentially, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to the pandemic, as well as our continued focus on cost management. Operating margin finished at 38%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $49 million, up sequentially but down over $10 million compared to last year.  Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11%. And and all told, second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08. 
So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever green bond. And as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and about $5.6 million in total debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.9x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than $2 billion of liquidity, easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021. Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell-through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about $60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around $100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our 7- to 8-week range. 
So finishing on cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from ops was $429 million, and CapEx was $60 million. We expect CapEx to decline meaningfully in the second half and finish the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately $230 million in dividends and repurchased $114 million of our stock. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period, we reduced debt by roughly $400 million and returned around $830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional $500 million via repurchases. 
As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow. 
Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Health care is very strong, and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business where we sell high-performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. 
And lastly, defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrops. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year. From an applied standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable, and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world. 
And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at $1.32 billion, plus or minus $70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately $50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comms, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3, plus or minus 150 bps. Planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08, plus or minus $0.11. 
As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around this. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas.

Vince, I guess the question that I'm getting this morning from investors is just relative to your July quarter guidance. Most of your peers have been guiding anywhere from 10 to 15 percentage points below seasonal. You guys are guiding about 5 percentage points below seasonal. And I guess the question that's being asked is, to what extent are you just not being as conservative as your peers? To what extent are there some idiosyncratic drivers? Could you help us parse that out?"

So I think, first and foremost, we've seen tremendous strength in our health care business over the last quarter, and we expect that -- that will also continue. Also, generally speaking, with virtualized commerce, work from home, we're seeing, again, very, very strong demand for the communications products. The optical cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well. And of course, 5G, especially in China and Asia, the 5G build-out is moving at pace. So what we're seeing -- what we're predicting looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen. And whatever -- what others are predicting, we feel comfortable based on the strike in the areas I've just mentioned. Our defense business continues quite strong. Also, businesses attached to, let's say, the buildout of data centers and cloud, like advanced instrumentation test systems for memory, storage and so on and so forth, are also doing particularly well. So our -- the overall industrial business holds in there, as Prashanth said, probably see a modest decline or seasonal decline in the third quarter. So overall, they are the drivers. And as Prashanth said, we expect a steep decline in the automotive business. But when you look at the puts and takes, that's how we see the quarter shaping up."

So very quickly, kind of, as expected, Feb was weak. March came back very strong, largely driven by China, but also some pretty strong demand outside from customer concerns, and then it began to correct. So April was soft, continued into May. We finished with kind of book-to-bill above 1.0 in all of our markets, except auto. So as we thought about the outlook, we -- we built our outlook on the expectation that orders are going to continue to slow through the quarter or best case stabilize. The guide that we have out there is built on 100% backlog coverage, which is much higher than we would normally use when we're at this point in the quarter. We're working terms with our customers, and we're enforcing them pretty stringently. So any customers or disty orders are noncancelable within a 35-day window, unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations. So all in, I think to be the assumptions are reasonable given the amount of uncertainty. And we did put a little bit wider range on there, plus or minus 70 to reflect the uncertainty. You follow that, John."

As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the concept of Industry 4.0 has been around for a while, but it does seem like COVID has the potential of actually shining a spotlight on that in a way that we have it. And I guess, in my mind, that probably also helps the 5G build because it's hard to have an intelligent factory floor without that 5G backbone. But I was hoping maybe you could help us define that market opportunity for you. When you look at sort of the intelligent factory floor what percent of your industrial business is it today?

I would say today, what we would consider to be Industry 4.0 with a highly cloud connected industrial sector is quite small. I think today, it's probably less than 10% of the total installations of factory automation and process commute systems. But the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that there are 2 things driving the need for the redeployment of industry -- probably 3 things. One, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that assumes automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter -- shorter robust connectivity. I think also the -- we're seeing the fragility of the supply chain globally. And customers are telling us they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the regionalization or the subornation of supply chains, and we can see the pressures there globally. And not to mention the demographics. Many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think it's a long way to go, John. We're in the early innings. Of the Industrial 4.0, the adoption of that."

So right now, it's a very, very hard market to read, both in terms of demand and, of course, supply. I think automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So we see, I would say, the 2 areas of most interest to us story are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging, for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing, audio signal processing in general. Adding, for example, active noise cancellation to the portfolio, and we're deploying that -- starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole infotainment side of things is an important part of the go ahead, and that's a place where we've a lot of heritage and we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space. 
In the electric vehicle area, I think it's got a long, long road ahead of it. As the electrification today, the powertrain, the -- as a portion of overall car sales, it's only about 1 -- certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go, and that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth -- our fifth generation of technology node product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas, we are actually increasing investments. 
Power is another area, the cross connective power into our business, particularly in Europe and the U.S., that's an important initiative. And we're seeing some very good green shoots there in terms of early-stage production of designs -- of power designs that we've attached to the single processing portfolio. I think it's also true to say, Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, partly in MEMS. You'll recall 3, 4 years ago, we withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic, infotainment and electric powertrain more strategic."

So right, in the near term, how we think about cost, and you've seen it in the OpEx results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already proven hiring we've essentially got travel at 0. We've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors. And perhaps most impactful is we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2% to 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about $35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November, and we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take, and we have taken in the past, such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008, 2009. It would certainly put activities like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items we'll think about. 
The -- on the manufacturing side, I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are, we feel, at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet as well as in the channel. So overall, I think we're well positioned if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe, Vince, do you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term?"

So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI gets stronger with with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future. So look, overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray.

So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers is with -- it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for, and that's how we're planning essentially the factory loadings to support this particular area. So I don't think -- I mean you asked about are we seeing double ordering and so on and so forth. What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many, many years is that you get generations. When a set of contracts are coming due, you see some level of, I would say, core need and a certain amount of redundancy built in, but it's pretty typical.

We're not going to let that go. 
In terms of how to think about the capital allocation. Our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business and whether that is organic or inorganic. And then after that, it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We're still intending to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million in this fiscal year. And then -- everything after that goes back to shareholders either through dividend or share repo.

But that's how we're viewing it. So the area that we feel kind of most conviction around in terms of demand will be for electric vehicles where our portfolio is making very strong headway, which was originally centered really in China into Europe and, of course, America as well. So very, very hard to read, I would say. But my sense is that remainder of this year will be tough, and we start to see off a pretty poultry bottom, I think, some recovery in the first half '21."

Overall, in the quarter just gone, we saw a modest decline, I would say, in our BMS revenues, but our design and hit rates are very, very strong.

Overall, in the quarter just gone, we saw a modest decline, I would say, in our BMS revenues, but our design and hit rates are very, very strong. We're set to -- at the present time, we have somewhere in the region of 45% -- 40% to 45% market share in BMS. And we believe that, that share will grow above 50% given the design pipeline that we have and the commitments that we have from customers across the globe. As I mentioned, in the previous answer there, we've managed to take what was a very channel-centric BMS business. We've been taking it across the globe. And that's for essentially the nonwireless set of things. The wireless battery, we're expecting to see our first production of that particular product happened in the kind of, I think, the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We're in a great position, I think, right now in North America, China, and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan. And Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption at any kind of meaningful level, and I feel good about where we are there. So our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there. But when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge, we got more than 20% gain in that -- along that metric. So overall, it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next 5, 10 years. And we're in a very, very good position to see the tailwinds from that as time plays out here."

Thank you all so very, very much.  
When we had our last earnings call in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depths of the COVID-19 impact in China, and since then, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, putting tremendous stress in society and, of course, the global economy.  
To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity, whenever that may be. While our sector is not immune to the turbulent operating environment, it's my belief that technology will be what modifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still; we've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position. And we are learning from this challenging period and adapting quickly while still investing to ensure that we are well positioned in the recovery and for the long term.  
Our team has embraced the challenges with many of our employees working from home, but obviously, not everyone can work remotely, and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees who've continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing and enhanced sanitization. And we provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time.  
Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our health care solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our health care customers. And I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we've shown in rising to this critical challenge.  
Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multimillion-dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. But our work goes beyond financial contributions. We're also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions, such as rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical-grade patient monitoring that leverage our technologies.  
So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted, and to date, we have seen a deterioration in demand within our automotive, broad-based industrial and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis. To that end, health care demand is at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed, wireline sectors. We're also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business.  
Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high performance analog, power and RF and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets.  
So now let me move to the other side of the equation and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted when many governments ordered shelter-in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end tests and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly, yet responsibly to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world.  
Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original range we provided on our first quarter earnings call, underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop.  
Now as we've mobilized preserve ADI strength in the near term, we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long term. Our team remains focused on our 3 strategic priorities, so let me provide you with a brief update on each.  
First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500.  
Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several black swan events successfully by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets.  
We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns, with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs, and while COVID-19 has brought new challenges, it has also revealed new opportunities in a reordered world.  
During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to reimagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high-performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle.  
And in our instrumentation test business for data center compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog mixed-signal and power micromodule portfolios. These solutions deliver 4x the channel density while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just 2 examples, there are many more across all of our markets. It's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic.  
Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common, that is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever, and new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. ADI, where the data is born, is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities, and I wanted to share some thoughts with you today.  
As I noted earlier, our health care business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast-track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, health care systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing and cloud capabilities is going to be required, and we believe that ADI's technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation.  
The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, as more people work remotely, transact business more digitally and consume media from everywhere. Here, ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required for an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next-generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size and power needs, positioning us to gain share and to capture additional value.  
Another secular trend we're benefiting from is the rise of Industry 4.0. Now while this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' minds. It's clear that post pandemic, supply chains will be reimagined, and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated and perhaps sovereign. To serve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain and power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software IO, depth sensing, condition-based monitoring and robust connectivity.  
Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive corporate responsibility report entitled Engineering Good, and I can assure you there will be more to come as I'm deeply committed to ADI's leadership here.  
So in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very, very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today, this unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We're embracing these short-term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talent, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.",1239,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Back in March, we withdrew our guidance for the second quarter as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However, we acted quickly and decisively, and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance, with revenue of $1.32 billion, operating margin of 38% and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings or approximately $50 million higher. 
So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets, while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19, performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially, and if not for supply constraints, we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid- to high single digits sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by $60 million in the quarter. 
Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our health care, memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period. 
Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially, and given the tough compare, decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long term, will be a high-growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems. 
Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly, our auto business was impacted by low vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. 
Lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. 
Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin came in at 67.7%, down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize $100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021 through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. 
OpEx was $390 million, down 5% sequentially, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to the pandemic, as well as our continued focus on cost management. Operating margin finished at 38%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $49 million, up sequentially but down over $10 million compared to last year.  Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11%, and all told, second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08. 
So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever green bond, and as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and about $5.6 million in total debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.9x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than $2 billion of liquidity, easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021. Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell-through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about $60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around $100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our 7- to 8-week range. 
So finishing on cash flow for the quarter, cash flow from ops was $429 million, and CapEx was $60 million. We expect CapEx to decline meaningfully in the second half and finish the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately $230 million in dividends and repurchased $114 million of our stock. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period, we reduced debt by roughly $400 million and returned around $830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional $500 million via repurchases. 
As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow. 
Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Health care is very strong, and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business where we sell high-performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. 
And lastly, defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrops. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year. From a supply standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable, and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world. 
And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at $1.32 billion, plus or minus $70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately $50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comms, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3%, plus or minus 150 bps, planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08, plus or minus $0.11. 
As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around this. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas.

The optical cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well. And of course, 5G, especially in China and Asia, the 5G build-out is moving at pace. So what we're seeing -- what we're predicting looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen. And whatever -- what others are predicting, we feel comfortable based on the strength in the areas I've just mentioned. Our defense business continues quite strong. Also, businesses attached to, let's say, the build-out of data centers and cloud, like advanced instrumentation test systems for memory, storage and so on and so forth, are also doing particularly well. So our -- the overall industrial business holds in there, as Prashanth said, probably see a modest decline or seasonal decline in the third quarter. So overall, they are the drivers. And as Prashanth said, we expect a steep decline in the automotive business. But when you look at the puts and takes, that's how we see the quarter shaping up."

So very quickly, kind of, as expected, Feb was weak. March came back very strong, largely driven by China, but also some pretty strong demand outside from customer concerns, and then it began to correct. So April was soft, continued into May. We finished with kind of book-to-bill above 1.0 in all of our markets, except auto. So as we thought about the outlook, we -- we built our outlook on the expectation that orders are going to continue to slow through the quarter or best case, stabilize. The guide that we have out there is built on 100% backlog coverage, which is much higher than we would normally use when we're at this point in the quarter. We're working terms with our customers, and we're enforcing them pretty stringently. So any customers or disty orders are noncancelable within a 35-day window, unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations. So all in, I think the assumptions are reasonable given the amount of uncertainty. And we did put a little bit wider range on there, plus or minus 70 to reflect the uncertainty. You follow that, John?"

And then, Vince, just as my follow-up. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the concept of Industry 4.0 has been around for a while, but it does seem like COVID has the potential of actually shining a spotlight on that in a way that we have it. And I guess, in my mind, that probably also helps the 5G build-out because it's hard to have an intelligent factory floor without that 5G backbone. But I was hoping maybe you could help us define that market opportunity for you. When you look at sort of the intelligent factory floor, what percent of your industrial business is it today? And how should we think about potential growth rates 3 to 5 years out, if this really starts to accelerate?"

I would say today, what we would consider to be Industry 4.0 with a highly cloud connected industrial sector is quite small. I think today, it's probably less than 10% of the total installations of factory automation and process control systems. But the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that there are 2 things driving the need for the deployment of industry -- probably 3 things. One, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that assumes automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter -- shorter robust connectivity. I think also the -- we're seeing the fragility of the supply chain globally. And customers are telling us they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the regionalization or the suburbanization of supply chains, and we can see the pressures there globally. And not to mention the demographics. Many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think it's a long way to go, John. We're in the early innings of the Industrial 4.0, the adoption of that."

So right now, it's a very, very hard market to read, both in terms of demand and, of course, supply. I think automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So we see, I would say, the 2 areas of most interest to us, Tore, are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging, for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing and audio signal processing in general adding, for example, active noise cancellation to the portfolio, and we're deploying that -- starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole infotainment side of things is an important part of the go ahead, and that's a place where we've a lot of heritage and where we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space. 
In the electric vehicle area, I think it's got a long, long road ahead of it. As the electrification today, the powertrain, the -- as a portion of overall car sales, it's only about 1 -- certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go, and that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth -- our fifth generation of technology node product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas, we are actually increasing investments. 
Power is another area, the cross connective power into our business, particularly in Europe and the U.S., that's an important initiative. And we're seeing some very good green shoots there in terms of early-stage production of designs -- of power designs that we've attached to the single processing portfolio. I think it's also true to say, Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, particularly in MEMS, you'll recall 3, 4 years ago, we withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic, infotainment and electric powertrain more strategic."

So right, in the near term, how we think about cost, and you've seen it in the OpEx results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already frozen hiring, we've essentially got travel at 0, we've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors. And perhaps most impactful is we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2% to 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about $35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November, and we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take, and we have taken in the past, such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008, 2009. It would certainly put activities like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items we'll think about. 
The -- on the manufacturing side, I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are, we feel, at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet as well as in the channel. So overall, I think we're well positioned if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe, Vince, do you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term?"

So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI gets stronger with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future. So look, overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray. And while -- I think Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we're preparing for the worst, but we're executing aggressively for the future."

So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about the deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers is with -- it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for, and that's how we're planning essentially the factory loadings to support this particular area. So I don't think -- I mean you asked about are we seeing double ordering and so on and so forth. What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many, many years is that you get generations. When a set of contracts are coming due, you see some level of, I would say, core need and a certain amount of redundancy built in, but it's pretty typical.

So I wouldn't run this level of OpEx out too long, but I think you've seen that we have been incredibly diligent with managing our OpEx over the last 1.5 years, and that's a muscle that ADI has built, and we're not going to let that go. 
In terms of how to think about the capital allocation, our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business and whether that is organic or inorganic. And then after that, it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We're still intending to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million in this fiscal year. And then everything after that goes back to shareholders either through dividend or share repo. So I would expect that we would be if business holds out that we would be reactivating the share repo in the coming quarters."

We're set to -- at the present time, we have somewhere in the region of 45% -- 40% to 45% market share in BMS. And we believe that, that share will grow above 50% given the design pipeline that we have and the commitments that we have from customers across the globe. As I mentioned, in the previous answer there, we've managed to take what was a very channel-centric BMS business. We've been taking it across the globe. And that's for essentially the nonwireless set of things. The wireless battery, we're expecting to see our first production of that particular product happened in the kind of, I think, the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We're in a great position, I think, right now in North America, China, and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan. And Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption at any kind of meaningful level, and I feel good about where we are there. So our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there. But when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge, we got more than 20% gain in that -- along that metric. So overall, it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next 5, 10 years. And we're in a very, very good position to see the tailwinds from that as time plays out here."

Thank you all so very, very much. 
When we had our last earnings call in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depths of the COVID-19 impact in China, and since then, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, putting tremendous stress in society and, of course, the global economy. 
To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity, whenever that may be. While our sector is not immune to the turbulent operating environment, it's my belief that technology will be what modifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still; we've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position. And we are learning from this challenging period and adapting quickly while still investing to ensure that we are well positioned in the recovery and for the long term. 
Our team has embraced the challenges with many of our employees working from home, but obviously, not everyone can work remotely, and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees who've continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing and enhanced sanitization. And we provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time. 
Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our health care solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our health care customers. And I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we've shown in rising to this critical challenge. 
Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multimillion-dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. But our work goes beyond financial contributions. We're also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions, such as rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical-grade patient monitoring that leverage our technologies. 
So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted, and to date, we have seen a deterioration in demand within our automotive, broad-based industrial and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis. To that end, health care demand is at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed, wireline sectors. We're also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business. 
Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high performance analog, power and RF and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets. 
So now let me move to the other side of the equation and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted when many governments ordered shelter-in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end tests and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly, yet responsibly to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world. 
Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original range we provided on our first quarter earnings call, underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop. 
Now as we've mobilized preserve ADI strength in the near term, we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long term. Our team remains focused on our 3 strategic priorities, so let me provide you with a brief update on each. 
First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. 
Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several black swan events successfully by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. 
We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns, with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs, and while COVID-19 has brought new challenges, it has also revealed new opportunities in a reordered world. 
During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to reimagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high-performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle. 
And in our instrumentation test business for data center compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog mixed-signal and power micromodule portfolios. These solutions deliver 4x the channel density while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just 2 examples, there are many more across all of our markets. It's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic. 
Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common, that is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever, and new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. ADI, where the data is born, is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities, and I wanted to share some thoughts with you today. 
As I noted earlier, our health care business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast-track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, health care systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing and cloud capabilities is going to be required, and we believe that ADI's technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation. 
The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, as more people work remotely, transact business more digitally and consume media from everywhere. Here, ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required for an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next-generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size and power needs, positioning us to gain share and to capture additional value. 
Another secular trend we're benefiting from is the rise of Industry 4.0. Now while this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' minds. It's clear that post pandemic, supply chains will be reimagined, and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated and perhaps sovereign. To serve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain and power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software IO, depth sensing, condition-based monitoring and robust connectivity. 
Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive corporate responsibility report entitled Engineering Good, and I can assure you there will be more to come as I'm deeply committed to ADI's leadership here. 
So in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very, very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today, this unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We're embracing these short-term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talent, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.",1239,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Back in March, we withdrew our guidance for the second quarter as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However, we acted quickly and decisively, and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance, with revenue of $1.32 billion, operating margin of 38% and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings or approximately $50 million higher. 
So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets, while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19, performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially, and if not for supply constraints, we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid- to high single digits sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by $60 million in the quarter. 
Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our health care, memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period. 
Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially, and given the tough compare, decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long term, will be a high-growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems. 
Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly, our auto business was impacted by low vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. 
Lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. 
Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin came in at 67.7%, down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize $100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021 through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. 
OpEx was $390 million, down 5% sequentially, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to the pandemic, as well as our continued focus on cost management. Operating margin finished at 38%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $49 million, up sequentially but down over $10 million compared to last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11%, and all told, second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08. 
So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever green bond, and as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and about $5.6 million in total debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.9x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than $2 billion of liquidity, easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021. Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell-through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about $60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around $100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our 7- to 8-week range. 
So finishing on cash flow for the quarter, cash flow from ops was $429 million, and CapEx was $60 million. We expect CapEx to decline meaningfully in the second half and finish the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately $230 million in dividends and repurchased $114 million of our stock. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period, we reduced debt by roughly $400 million and returned around $830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional $500 million via repurchases. 
As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow. 
Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Health care is very strong, and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business where we sell high-performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. 
And lastly, defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrops. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year. From a supply standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable, and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world. 
And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at $1.32 billion, plus or minus $70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately $50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comms, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3%, plus or minus 150 bps, planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08, plus or minus $0.11. 
As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around this. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas.

So I think, first and foremost, we've seen tremendous strength in our health care business over the last quarter, and we expect that -- that will also continue. Also, generally speaking, with virtualized commerce, work from home, we're seeing, again, very, very strong demand for the communications products. The optical cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well. And of course, 5G, especially in China and Asia, the 5G build-out is moving at pace. So what we're seeing -- what we're predicting looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen. And whatever -- what others are predicting, we feel comfortable based on the strength in the areas I've just mentioned. Our defense business continues quite strong.

We're working terms with our customers, and we're enforcing them pretty stringently. So any customers or disty orders are noncancelable within a 35-day window, unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations. So all in, I think the assumptions are reasonable given the amount of uncertainty. And we did put a little bit wider range on there, plus or minus 70 to reflect the uncertainty. You follow that, John?"

And then, Vince, just as my follow-up. As you mentioned in your prepared comments, the concept of Industry 4.0 has been around for a while, but it does seem like COVID has the potential of actually shining a spotlight on that in a way that we have it. And I guess, in my mind, that probably also helps the 5G build-out because it's hard to have an intelligent factory floor without that 5G backbone. But I was hoping maybe you could help us define that market opportunity for you. When you look at sort of the intelligent factory floor, what percent of your industrial business is it today? And how should we think about potential growth rates 3 to 5 years out, if this really starts to accelerate?"

I would say today, what we would consider to be Industry 4.0 with a highly cloud connected industrial sector is quite small. I think today, it's probably less than 10% of the total installations of factory automation and process control systems. But the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that there are 2 things driving the need for the deployment of industry -- probably 3 things. One, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that assumes automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter -- shorter robust connectivity. I think also the -- we're seeing the fragility of the supply chain globally. And customers are telling us they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the regionalization or the suburbanization of supply chains, and we can see the pressures there globally. And not to mention the demographics. Many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think it's a long way to go, John. We're in the early innings of the Industrial 4.0, the adoption of that."

So right now, it's a very, very hard market to read, both in terms of demand and, of course, supply. I think automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So we see, I would say, the 2 areas of most interest to us, Tore, are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging, for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing and audio signal processing in general adding, for example, active noise cancellation to the portfolio, and we're deploying that -- starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole infotainment side of things is an important part of the go ahead, and that's a place where we've a lot of heritage and where we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space. 
In the electric vehicle area, I think it's got a long, long road ahead of it. As the electrification today, the powertrain, the -- as a portion of overall car sales, it's only about 1 -- certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go, and that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth -- our fifth generation of technology node product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas, we are actually increasing investments. 
Power is another area, the cross connective power into our business, particularly in Europe and the U.S., that's an important initiative. And we're seeing some very good green shoots there in terms of early-stage production of designs -- of power designs that we've attached to the single processing portfolio. I think it's also true to say, Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, particularly in MEMS, you'll recall 3, 4 years ago, we withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic, infotainment and electric powertrain more strategic."

So right, in the near term, how we think about cost, and you've seen it in the OpEx results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already frozen hiring, we've essentially got travel at 0, we've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors. And perhaps most impactful is we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2% to 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about $35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November, and we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take, and we have taken in the past, such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008, 2009. It would certainly put activities like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items we'll think about. 
The -- on the manufacturing side, I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are, we feel, at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet as well as in the channel. So overall, I think we're well positioned if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe, Vince, do you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term?"

So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI gets stronger with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future. So look, overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray. And while -- I think Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we're preparing for the worst, but we're executing aggressively for the future."

So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about the deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers is with -- it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for, and that's how we're planning essentially the factory loadings to support this particular area. So I don't think -- I mean you asked about are we seeing double ordering and so on and so forth. What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many, many years is that you get generations.

Some of that is clearly actively managing the spend levels down, but some of it is also the result of this COVID situation where travel is at a freeze. I think it's reasonable to expect that as businesses reopen and customer expectations start to change, and we need to get back in front of folks that some of that is going to climb and as well as some other discretionary spend will come back in. So I wouldn't run this level of OpEx out too long, but I think you've seen that we have been incredibly diligent with managing our OpEx over the last 1.5 years, and that's a muscle that ADI has built, and we're not going to let that go. 
In terms of how to think about the capital allocation, our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business and whether that is organic or inorganic. And then after that, it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We're still intending to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million in this fiscal year. And then everything after that goes back to shareholders either through dividend or share repo. So I would expect that we would be if business holds out that we would be reactivating the share repo in the coming quarters."

As I mentioned, in the previous answer there, we've managed to take what was a very channel-centric BMS business. We've been taking it across the globe. And that's for essentially the nonwireless set of things. The wireless battery, we're expecting to see our first production of that particular product happened in the kind of, I think, the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We're in a great position, I think, right now in North America, China, and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan. And Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption at any kind of meaningful level, and I feel good about where we are there. So our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there. But when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge, we got more than 20% gain in that -- along that metric. So overall, it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next 5, 10 years.

Thank you all so very, very much. 
When we had our last earnings call in mid-February, we were just beginning to understand the depths of the COVID-19 impact in China, and since then, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, putting tremendous stress in society and, of course, the global economy. 
To counterbalance this, we've seen an unprecedented response from governments with the deployment of fiscal and monetary policies to soften the downturn and restart economic activity, whenever that may be. While our sector is not immune to the turbulent operating environment, it's my belief that technology will be what modifies the current weakness and drives new demand and business models post pandemic. That's not to say that we're standing still; we've taken actions to curtail spending and reinforce our cash position. And we are learning from this challenging period and adapting quickly while still investing to ensure that we are well positioned in the recovery and for the long term. 
Our team has embraced the challenges with many of our employees working from home, but obviously, not everyone can work remotely, and I want to acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees who've continued to perform at exceptional levels and deliver for our customers. For these employees supporting our critical operations, we've implemented safeguards to protect them, including more PPE, increasing social distancing and enhanced sanitization. And we provided them with additional incentives and benefits to allow for continuity during this very difficult time. 
Our team has also done an excellent job staying close to our customers. We moved quickly to pivot manufacturing lines and prioritize our health care solutions that are needed in the fight against COVID-19. This has allowed us to expedite supply used in products such as ventilators, respirators, imaging systems and patient monitors to our health care customers. And I'm incredibly proud of the resourcefulness and commitment that we've shown in rising to this critical challenge. 
Additionally, through the ADI Foundation, we've made multimillion-dollar donations to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. But our work goes beyond financial contributions. We're also partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions, such as rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests and clinical-grade patient monitoring that leverage our technologies. 
So now I'd like to discuss the current operating environment a bit. Given the reach and depth of the current crisis, global business activity has been disrupted, and to date, we have seen a deterioration in demand within our automotive, broad-based industrial and consumer businesses. However, our business is proving more resilient than during the global financial crisis. To that end, health care demand is at record levels and communications demand is robust across wireless and indeed, wireline sectors. We're also seeing strength in portions of our industrial instrumentation business and steadiness in our defense business. 
Now this success is no accident. Through our organic investments and acquisitions of Hittite and LTC, ADI is a very different company than we were a decade ago with more diversity, a broader portfolio across high performance analog, power and RF and higher exposure to more profitable and durable end markets. 
So now let me move to the other side of the equation and talk a little bit about supply. Across the world, supply chains were disrupted when many governments ordered shelter-in-place mandates and closed their borders. For ADI, capacity was reduced at our back-end tests and assembly sites in mid-March across the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore. Once granted essential status, we acted quickly, yet responsibly to ensure employee safety and improve our capacity. And today, I'm glad to say we're operating at normal capacity levels. This demonstrates the agility of our global operations and the dedication of ADI's employees around the world. 
Despite the fluid and uncertain demand and supply environment, we delivered revenue of $1.32 billion and EPS of $1.08. This was in line with the original range we provided on our first quarter earnings call, underscoring the resiliency and flexibility of our business model in any economic backdrop. 
Now as we've mobilized preserve ADI strength in the near term, we're capitalizing on the many opportunities we see to fortify and expand our market position for the long term. Our team remains focused on our 3 strategic priorities, so let me provide you with a brief update on each. 
First is the efficient use of capital. Importantly, ADI has ample financial liquidity to meet the needs of our business across critical investments, dividend payments and servicing our debt. Despite the current macro environment, we've generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 32% of sales over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. 
Throughout our 55-year history, we've encountered and navigated several black swan events successfully by taking a disciplined and balanced approach to financial management. Specifically, the first call on our capital is funding new product development. This means investing smartly in both our people and technologies to ensure we continue to deliver disruptive innovation. In the quarter just passed, we invested 19% of revenue in R&D, spending 95% on the most attractive opportunities across our B2B markets. 
We also remain committed to strong shareholder returns, with our dividend as the cornerstone. In the quarter, we returned over $340 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
So let me turn to our second priority, which is about maximizing customer impact. We are continuously innovating to stay ahead of customer needs, and while COVID-19 has brought new challenges, it has also revealed new opportunities in a reordered world. 
During the quarter, our customer engagement didn't slow down. We hosted hundreds of virtual seminars with thousands of customers in attendance, training them on new solutions and new technologies. These interactions were very productive. We saw increased design activity on new product development across markets and customers. For example, we partnered with a key electric vehicle customer to reimagine how audio is rendered across their fleet. As a result of this increased and focused collaboration, we added our high-performance audio digital signal processors to our A2B platform, more than doubling our content per vehicle. 
And in our instrumentation test business for data center compute, we continue to work with customers on reducing their system complexity and getting to market faster. Our innovative solutions combine our analog mixed-signal and power micromodule portfolios. These solutions deliver 4x the channel density while simultaneously increasing throughput. While these are just 2 examples, there are many more across all of our markets. It's this current flurry of design activity that positions ADI to accelerate post pandemic. 
Our third priority is capitalizing on secular trends to expand our addressable markets and drive diversified growth. While every downturn has its own unique characteristics, they all seem to have one thing in common, that is they drive tremendous change. Industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever, and new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. ADI, where the data is born, is at the center of these exciting secular growth opportunities, and I wanted to share some thoughts with you today. 
As I noted earlier, our health care business is providing several of the technologies that are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. Taking a step back, ADI has been committed to this market for many years, as we anticipated the opportunity for innovation to deliver better patient outcomes. Now this crisis will challenge us to rethink and hopefully fast-track the accessibility, affordability and wellness focus of global healthcare. To achieve this, health care systems are going to need to be upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring will need to be extended from the hospital right down to the patient's home. Massive adoption of sensing, computing and cloud capabilities is going to be required, and we believe that ADI's technologies will be at the forefront of this transformation. 
The communications market is moving at a rapid pace to keep up with the strains put on bandwidth and latency, as more people work remotely, transact business more digitally and consume media from everywhere. Here, ADI is playing a critical role in building out the infrastructure required for an always connected world. Our integrated transceiver, power and optical control portfolios are enabling customers to economically scale their investments to build the next-generation networks. We continue to innovate to meet future performance, size and power needs, positioning us to gain share and to capture additional value. 
Another secular trend we're benefiting from is the rise of Industry 4.0. Now while this trend isn't so new, the pandemic is moving it to the forefront of our customers' minds. It's clear that post pandemic, supply chains will be reimagined, and new ones will be built, ones that are more flexible, automated and perhaps sovereign. To serve the economic burden that comes with this, customers will further automate their businesses with intelligent and connected factory floors and the increased use of robots, cobots and analytics. This creates additional demand for our precision signal chain and power franchises and extends ADI into new areas like software IO, depth sensing, condition-based monitoring and robust connectivity. 
Outside of these secular growth trends, I'm also personally inspired by the tremendous sustainability benefits that we've seen in a short amount of time. For example, we've seen sizable decreases in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide. I believe that ADI and the industry at large can and should be leveraging its creative brainpower to be better stewards of the planet. We recently published our comprehensive corporate responsibility report entitled Engineering Good, and I can assure you there will be more to come as I'm deeply committed to ADI's leadership here. 
So in closing, the shape of the economic recovery is still very, very uncertain and dependent on many variables. While we're confident in our outlook provided today, this unprecedented macro backdrop will continue to influence supply and demand dynamics for some time to come. We're embracing these short-term challenges and by leveraging the collective power of our talent, our technology and customer engagements, I'm very confident we will emerge stronger. 
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Prashanth."

Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.",1239,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments today, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
Back in March, we withdrew our guidance for the second quarter as the spread of COVID created an enormous amount of uncertainty and impacted our supply chain. However, we acted quickly and decisively, and I'm pleased to say that our second quarter results were within our original guidance, with revenue of $1.32 billion, operating margin of 38% and EPS of $1.08. Without those capacity limitations, we believe revenue would have been above our original midpoint provided at our first quarter earnings or approximately $50 million higher. 
So let's get into the market results. Our B2B markets, while very volatile intra-quarter due to COVID-19, performed relatively in line with our expectations. B2B revenue increased 3% sequentially, and if not for supply constraints, we would have delivered on our outlook of growing mid- to high single digits sequentially. Notably, we achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by $60 million in the quarter. 
Industrial, which represented 54% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 4% sequentially and declined 8% year-over-year. While we experienced broad-based weakness across most applications, our health care, memory test and energy verticals all grew from the year ago period. 
Communications, which accounted for 21% of revenue, finished up 15% sequentially, and given the tough compare, decreased 24% year-over-year with weakness across both wireless and wired. This market is and will remain lumpy, but over the long term, will be a high-growth market for ADI, given our positioning in 5G and optical control systems. 
Automotive, which represented 14% of revenue, down 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, with declines across all major applications. Not surprisingly, our auto business was impacted by low vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many customers were required to suspend their operations in response to COVID-19. 
Lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially and 5% year-over-year as lower consumer spending impacted both portables and prosumer. Notably, we continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer segment. 
Let's go to the P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin came in at 67.7%, down both sequentially and year-over-year related to low utilizations from reduced production levels and the factory closures I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we expect to realize $100 million of cost of goods savings exiting fiscal 2021 through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. 
OpEx was $390 million, down 5% sequentially, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of decline. This was driven by a combination of the quick aggressive measures we took in response to the pandemic, as well as our continued focus on cost management. Operating margin finished at 38%, up over 100 basis points sequentially and down year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $49 million, up sequentially but down over $10 million compared to last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11%, and all told, second quarter adjusted EPS came in at $1.08. 
So now let's go to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we proactively bolstered our strong liquidity position. We retired a $300 million bond and subsequently raised $400 million from the semiconductor industry's first ever green bond, and as a cautionary measure, we also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway through the quarter. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and about $5.6 million in total debt. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.9x on a trailing 12-month basis. 
Between cash on our balance sheet and the commitments under our revolving credit facility, ADI has more than $2 billion of liquidity, easily eclipsing our annual dividend payment and the debt due in January of 2021. Inventory was essentially flat from the first quarter. However, days of inventory fell to 126 from 133. Our sell-in revenue was well below our sell-through revenue at distributors. As I mentioned, we reduced channel inventory by about $60 million in the second quarter. This brings our total channel reduction to around $100 million in the first half of fiscal 2020. Channel inventory currently sits comfortably at the low end of our 7- to 8-week range. 
So finishing on cash flow for the quarter, cash flow from ops was $429 million, and CapEx was $60 million. We expect CapEx to decline meaningfully in the second half and finish the year below our normal target range of 4% of revenue. In the quarter, ADI paid approximately $230 million in dividends and repurchased $114 million of our stock. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow finished at $1.8 billion or 32% of revenue. Over this period, we reduced debt by roughly $400 million and returned around $830 million to shareholders via dividends and an additional $500 million via repurchases. 
As a reminder, our capital return policy is to return all free cash flow after debt reduction to shareholders. In fiscal 2020, we expect to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million and return 100% of the remaining free cash flow. 
Before moving to our outlook, I want to highlight what we are seeing in terms of demand and supply. As Vince mentioned earlier, our business is performing quite well under the current macro backdrop. Health care is very strong, and we expect this strength to persist into the back half of the year. We are seeing robust demand in communications across both wireless from 5G deployments and wireline from data center and networking upgrades. This strength is benefiting our industrial instrumentation business where we sell high-performance solutions used in both memory and 5G testing. 
And lastly, defense is typically a steady business against all economic backdrops. All told, these markets represent almost half of ADI's revenue over the last year. From a supply standpoint, we enter our fiscal third quarter at normal capacity levels. This is quite remarkable, and I want to echo Vince's appreciation for the dedicated manufacturing teams across the world. 
And that brings us to our third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially at $1.32 billion, plus or minus $70 million, which is a wider range than usual to account for the uncertain environment. This outlook includes approximately $50 million of revenue that was pushed from second quarter due to capacity constraints. We are assuming no change in channel inventory in this plan. We anticipate robust sequential growth in comms, modest sequential declines in industrial and consumer and a sharp sequential decline in automotive. All told, B2B should increase slightly sequentially and decline just under 10% year-over-year. We anticipate op margins to be approximately 38.3%, plus or minus 150 bps, planning for the tax rate in the quarter to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08, plus or minus $0.11. 
As Vince said, we are confident in our third quarter outlook, but we are mindful of the tremendous uncertainty around this. Our operating model is to plan conservatively and execute aggressively to preserve free cash flow in the near term. At the same time, we remain focused on the long term, continuing to invest to capture and create value across several exciting secular growth areas. 
Let me pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

So I think, first and foremost, we've seen tremendous strength in our health care business over the last quarter, and we expect that -- that will also continue. Also, generally speaking, with virtualized commerce, work from home, we're seeing, again, very, very strong demand for the communications products. The optical cable portfolios of ADI are doing particularly well. And of course, 5G, especially in China and Asia, the 5G build-out is moving at pace. So what we're seeing -- what we're predicting looking ahead is based on the order streams that we've seen. And whatever -- what others are predicting, we feel comfortable based on the strength in the areas I've just mentioned. Our defense business continues quite strong. Also, businesses attached to, let's say, the build-out of data centers and cloud, like advanced instrumentation test systems for memory, storage and so on and so forth, are also doing particularly well. So our -- the overall industrial business holds in there, as Prashanth said, probably see a modest decline or seasonal decline in the third quarter. So overall, they are the drivers.

So very quickly, kind of, as expected, Feb was weak.

We finished with kind of book-to-bill above 1.0 in all of our markets, except auto. So as we thought about the outlook, we -- we built our outlook on the expectation that orders are going to continue to slow through the quarter or best case, stabilize. The guide that we have out there is built on 100% backlog coverage, which is much higher than we would normally use when we're at this point in the quarter. We're working terms with our customers, and we're enforcing them pretty stringently. So any customers or disty orders are noncancelable within a 35-day window, unless we agree to grant an exception. So that's helping to kind of clean through the backlog and limit order cancellations. So all in, I think the assumptions are reasonable given the amount of uncertainty. And we did put a little bit wider range on there, plus or minus 70 to reflect the uncertainty. You follow that, John?"

But the intelligence we're getting from many of our customers now is that there are 2 things driving the need for the deployment of industry -- probably 3 things. One, the need for them to understand how to gather and utilize data analytics to improve the outcomes for their customers. So that assumes automatically that you deploy 5G, you deploy optical connectivity, many forms of shorter -- shorter robust connectivity. I think also the -- we're seeing the fragility of the supply chain globally. And customers are telling us they're expecting to bring more machine capability into managing the supply chain. And I think thirdly is the regionalization or the suburbanization of supply chains, and we can see the pressures there globally. And not to mention the demographics. Many of the societies that are producing lots of capital goods and consumer good outputs like Germany, China and as America begins to regionalize supply chain, we're likely to see the adoption of cobotics and more robotics technologies in general. So I think it's a long way to go, John. We're in the early innings of the Industrial 4.0, the adoption of that."

So right now, it's a very, very hard market to read,",367,"Well, we've actually been ramping, Tore, our investments in automotive, particularly in the infotainment, the power side of things, and also the electrification of the vehicle, the electric powertrain. So right now, it's a very, very hard market to read, both in terms of demand and, of course, supply. I think automotive has been extremely hard hit by the closures globally. So we see, I would say, the 2 areas of most interest to us, Tore, are the infotainment, the car experience, leveraging, for example, our A2B technology, our heritage and digital signal processing and audio signal processing in general adding, for example, active noise cancellation to the portfolio, and we're deploying that -- starting to deploy that now. So I think the whole infotainment side of things is an important part of the go ahead, and that's a place where we've a lot of heritage and where we're actually increasing investment. We just acquired a company actually during the quarter to enable us to bring more signal processing to the audio space. 
In the electric vehicle area, I think it's got a long, long road ahead of it. As the electrification today, the powertrain, the -- as a portion of overall car sales, it's only about 1 -- certainly less than 2% of total car sales. So a long, long way to go, and that's an area where we have strong position. We're on our fourth -- our fifth generation of technology node product delivery to that sector. So I'd say in those areas, we are actually increasing investments. 
Power is another area, the cross connective power into our business, particularly in Europe and the U.S., that's an important initiative. And we're seeing some very good green shoots there in terms of early-stage production of designs -- of power designs that we've attached to the single processing portfolio. I think it's also true to say, Tore, that probably on the safety side of things, we've been decreasing our investments over the last several years, particularly in MEMS, you'll recall 3, 4 years ago, we withdrew most of our investments in that area. So I would say safety is more opportunistic, infotainment and electric powertrain more strategic."

So right, in the near term, how we think about cost, and you've seen it in the OpEx results already. We have a variable comp structure that is intended to act as a shock absorber and that unwinds as revenue falls. On the discretionary side, we've already frozen hiring, we've essentially got travel at 0, we've exited consultants and any discretionary contractors. And perhaps most impactful is we've deferred our merit increase, which is usually 2% to 3% year-over-year. We are on track to realize about $35 million of synergies that we announced last year in November, and we still have $100 million of cost synergies that will come through by the end of 2021. So there are some more permanent actions that we can take, and we have taken in the past, such as furloughing employees until demand returns. We did this back in 2008, 2009. It would certainly put activities like temporary actions on the table. So there are all items we'll think about. 
The -- on the manufacturing side, I would emphasize that our utilizations are fairly low right now. So we're kind of at the trough levels. Inventories are, we feel, at a good position. So I don't think we have kind of the same inventory exposure that we would have had at the same time last year. We've reduced on the balance sheet as well as in the channel. So overall, I think we're well positioned if this breaks up or should it break down. Maybe, Vince, do you want to talk a bit more about kind of longer term?"

So we also believe very strongly in the persistence and the pervasiveness of our technologies. So I believe that the story for ADI gets stronger with the tailwinds that we have and the portfolio that we have for the future. So look, overall, our goal is to take advantage of the disarray. And while -- I think Prashanth said in his prepared remarks, we're preparing for the worst, but we're executing aggressively for the future."

So it's pretty clear what the carriers are saying about the deployment of 5G globally right now. Our reconciliation in terms of how we balance the demand of the carriers is with -- it is very tightly tied to our supply. So we have a good sense for what the carriers are looking for, and that's how we're planning essentially the factory loadings to support this particular area. So I don't think -- I mean you asked about are we seeing double ordering and so on and so forth. What is characteristic in the base station infrastructure market over many, many years is that you get generations. When a set of contracts are coming due, you see some level of, I would say, core need and a certain amount of redundancy built in, but it's pretty typical.

Some of that is clearly actively managing the spend levels down, but some of it is also the result of this COVID situation where travel is at a freeze. I think it's reasonable to expect that as businesses reopen and customer expectations start to change, and we need to get back in front of folks that some of that is going to climb and as well as some other discretionary spend will come back in. So I wouldn't run this level of OpEx out too long, but I think you've seen that we have been incredibly diligent with managing our OpEx over the last 1.5 years, and that's a muscle that ADI has built, and we're not going to let that go. 
In terms of how to think about the capital allocation, our framework really hasn't changed. The first call is to invest in the business and whether that is organic or inorganic. And then after that, it's really 100% return of free cash flow after debt repayments. So the plan for 2020, we increased the dividend by 15%. We're still intending to reduce debt by $300 million to $500 million in this fiscal year. And then everything after that goes back to shareholders either through dividend or share repo. So I would expect that we would be if business holds out that we would be reactivating the share repo in the coming quarters."

So I would say we think it will be tough going for the remainder of this year in automotive. And perhaps, we'll start to see a recovery in the first half of the coming year. But that's how we're viewing it. So the area that we feel kind of most conviction around in terms of demand will be for electric vehicles where our portfolio is making very strong headway, which was originally centered really in China into Europe and, of course, America as well. So very, very hard to read, I would say. But my sense is that remainder of this year will be tough, and we start to see off a pretty paltry bottom, I think, some recovery in the first half of '21."

As I mentioned, in the previous answer there, we've managed to take what was a very channel-centric BMS business. We've been taking it across the globe. And that's for essentially the nonwireless set of things. The wireless battery, we're expecting to see our first production of that particular product happened in the kind of, I think, the second half of 2021. So that's how we see it. We're in a great position, I think, right now in North America, China, and we're also beginning to penetrate Japan. And Europe, I think, is in the early stages of adoption at any kind of meaningful level, and I feel good about where we are there. So our portfolio is highly differentiated. There are many pretenders out there. But when it comes to optimizing the miles per charge, we got more than 20% gain in that -- along that metric. So overall, it's a 1% to 2% penetration of the car sector. It will probably go to 25% over the next 5, 10 years.

I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time. 
So I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on our priorities. This includes additional insight, of course, into our recently announced acquisition of Maxim Integrated. 
ADI executed exceptionally well in the third quarter despite the highly uncertain environment. Demand was resilient, surpassing our expectations, leading to stronger-than-expected results. We saw continued strength in communications across both wireless and wireline applications. Healthcare saw record demand and other parts of our industrial portfolio such as instrumentation tests also performed well. Unsurprisingly, the main area of weakness was automotive, driven by global factory shutdown, slower vehicle sales. 
Turning to supply. We're operating at normal capacity, which helped us clear backlog and bring supply and demand into a better balance. Our team delivered third quarter results above the midpoint of our revised guide with revenue at $1.46 billion and EPS at $1.36. B2B revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially and both gross and operating margins returned within the range of our financial model at 70% and 42%, respectively. We also generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. These results further underscore the strength and flexibility of our business model against any economic backdrop, and I'm proud of how the ADI team continues to deliver for our customers. 
Now I'll turn to an update on our strategic priorities. We're focused on spending our capital efficiently, and the first call is funding new product development. During the quarter, we invested approximately $260 million in R&D, with more than 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This continued reinvestment in our business is leading to excellent customer engagements, and let me provide you now with a couple of examples. 
In our communications business, we announced the collaboration with Intel to create a flexible radial platform that will enable customers to scale their 5G networks more quickly and more economically. The high-performance Oran compliance solution leverages our market-leading software-defined transceiver technologies. This positions ADI to expand our market leadership. 
In automotive, our new road noise counseling solution is gaining traction. Since announcing our initial win with Hyundai in February, we've added 5 more customers, including the North American leader in electric vehicles. This innovative solution reduces the car weights by almost 100 pounds and energy requirements by about 3%, while potentially doubling our content opportunity per vehicle. We're seeing great design momentum across our diversified industrial market also. For example, in factory automation, customers are rethinking supply chains to make them more flexible with faster response times. And to quicken the pace of adoption, we have formed an alliance of partners to develop an open source architecture. I'm excited to announce a Fortune 500 health care customer is teaming with ADI to help upgrade its manufacturing capabilities using more connected robotics, thereby doubling our addressable market. 
And in space, we have design wins going to production this year with traditional aerospace companies and new emerging disruptors that enable the proliferation of next-generation communication satellites. These satellites continuously change their position to earth and require space grade phased array and beam forming technology to create an uninterrupted connection. And we're using this strong position in RF to attach power technologies, thereby increasing our addressable market by 1/3. ADI also remains committed to strong shareholder returns. This quarter, we returned approximately $230 million through dividends. Recall that we paused share buybacks due to the pandemic. This has helped us further solidify our balance sheet with a cash balance of more than $1 billion. 
At this point, I'd be remiss to not discuss our M&A strategy in the light of the Maxim acquisition. ADI selectively uses M&A to expand both our scale and our scope in order to better address the future needs of our customers and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And while cost synergies are an important element in evaluating any acquisition, from our perspective, the most compelling benefits come from combining technology portfolios to capture new addressable markets and drive on term revenue synergies. This really takes time to realize, given the nature of the analog business, but our products deliver recurring revenue streams and cash flow for decades. Therefore, we strive to achieve our return objective within approximately 5 years. This time frame allows us to not only achieve the stated cost savings but also begin to capture the early revenue synergies. And I think the acquisition of LTC illustrates the benefits of our strategy. 
Our top priorities there were harmonizing the 2 organizations to create an entity that is better than the sum of its parts. To that end, I'm proud to say that we've retained and invested in LTC's exceptional engineering talent. Together, we've created an exciting road map of high-performance analog and power solutions combined. We're exceeding our original $150 million cost synergy target, and we're on track to realize the next $100 million exiting fiscal '21. 
And from a revenue perspective, we've more than doubled our pipeline value, and we have over $500 million of lifetime revenue coming to market this year, increasing our confidence in doubling LTC's historical growth rate. With LTC complete, we pursued the acquisition of Maxim to strengthen our leadership in the analog industry, better positioning ADI to capitalize on secular growth trends. 
Over the last 5 years, Maxim has shifted its business strategy to focus on B2B markets while enhancing profitability. As a result, Maxim has increased its B2B revenue mix to approximately 80% of total from 55%, expanded its gross margins by more than 500 basis points and increased its free cash flow margin by over 600 basis points during this period. Combined, we're confident we will continue to improve Maxim's performance. This will be driven by our cadre of engineering talent, complementary technologies and breadth of market applications that I'd like to expand on a little here. The cultures of ADI and Maxim are very aligned. Both companies share a commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. With a combined team of more than 10,000 engineers and $1.5 billion of annual R&D investment, we will continue to be the destination for the world's best analog talent. And with 3x the field technical resources, we'll be better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support. 
In the area of power management, Maxim's application focused offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. Together, we will have a more comprehensive power portfolio with approximately $2 billion of revenue. This is particularly important as power is the largest and fastest-growing analog subsegment and with increasing design complexity and the need for better efficiency, the system power challenges that our customers must overcome continue to rise and rise. 
In automotive, Maxim has one of the premier franchisees, increasing revenue at a mid-teens rate over the last 5 years. They're a leader in high-speed data connectivity for cameras, radars and processors with serial link technology while ADI is a leader in audio solutions with our A2B platform, and both companies are well positioned in vehicle electrification, enabling us to better address automakers EV requirements, which continuously evolve. Together, we will capture more of the increasing system content per vehicle and enable a better experience for the consumer. 
Taking a step back, the combined company will have unique positioning with 85% exposure to highly profitable long life B2B markets. Maxim's strengths in the automotive and data center markets will complement ADI's strengths across the industrial, communications and digital health care markets. Additionally, the combined company will have increased financial strength. We expect the combination to be accretive to adjusted EPS within 18 months post close, with targeted cost synergies of $275 million by the end of the second year. We also expect to maintain an industry-leading financial profile. As always, we are committed to generating robust free cash flow, and our goal is to reach the high end of our margin range of 40%. 
With our lower leverage ratio at close, we'll also have the opportunity to deliver enhanced cash returns to our shareholders. And I believe that together, we can grow revenue at mid-single digits due to our alignment with important secular growth trends, such as Industry 4.0, digital health care, next-generation communication systems and vehicle electrification as examples. 
So in closing, we're seeing promising evidence that a broad-based recovery is underway. However, we recognize that the recovery is highly dependent on the future impacts of the pandemic. We've used this unprecedented time to better align our organization and investments into the most important areas. We believe will emerge stronger and are better positioned to drive profitable growth. And as I've shared today, we're very excited about the combination with Maxim, which will drive the next wave of disruptive innovation and deliver significant benefits for all stakeholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Prashanth to go through the financial details."

Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. When",1266,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and non-op expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. 
When we provided quarterly guidance in May, we were facing tremendous uncertainty, just returning to normal capacity levels and experiencing volatile demand patterns across end markets. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand that resulted in less cancellations and higher-than-anticipated backlog conversion. With that as context, our results came in above the midpoint of our revised outlook, with revenue of $1.46 billion, operating margins over 42% and EPS of $1.36. 
Let me start now with the end market color. Our B2B revenue was up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year as strength across industrial and communications offset a sharp decline in automotive. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 3% year-over-year. We experienced robust growth in health care, instrumentation test and energy applications. This strength was moderated by weaker trends across our broad market and automation businesses. Communications, which accounted for 25% of revenue, achieved a record quarter. Revenue finished up 14% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases across both wireless and wireline. This strength came from our leadership position in 5G wireless systems and our solid position in optical connectivity used in carrier networks and data centers. 
Automotive, which represented 11% of revenue, decreased 29% year-over-year, with all applications declining due to global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. And while no business is immune to the current environment, our BMS and A2B solutions fared quite well. BMS revenue increased sequentially and was down just modestly year-over-year due to our strong penetration across the ecosystem and increasing consumer preference for electric vehicles. And given the continued adoption of our A2B audio platform, A2B revenue has increased over 70% year-to-date despite lower vehicle sales. 
Consumer, which also represented 11% of revenue, was down 13% year-over-year. Relatively flat portable revenue was more than offset by double-digit declines in prosumer due to the pandemic related softness. We continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer business. In addition to the end market commentary, we wanted to provide some insight by geography as we believe it is helpful to investors in this current climate. Most geographies declined year-over-year. We saw double-digit declines in Europe and Japan, while the decline in North America was less pronounced. The rest of Asia increased and China increased double digits year-over-year, largely driven by the robust growth in communications, given our solid position as well as strength in industrial. 
Now moving on to the P&L. Gross margins returned to our model at approximately 70%, down modestly year-over-year from lower fab utilization. We've accelerated the planned LTC factory closings and have started to realize these benefits in the third quarter. We expect additional savings in the fourth quarter and we'll exit fiscal 2020 with nearly half of the $100 million savings in our run rate. 
OpEx was $402 million, up 3% sequentially, yet down 8% year-over-year. We maintained a focus on controlling expenses, which included a 1-week global shutdown during the quarter. OP margins finished at 42.3%, the highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Non-op expenses were $46 million, down $3 million sequentially and more than $10 million year-over-year, driven by lower levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11.5%, and all told, third quarter EPS came in at $1.36. 
Now moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and about $5.6 billion in total debt. This resulted in a leverage ratio of 1.8x on a trailing 12-month basis. Inventory dollars increased $22 million sequentially, but declined year-over-year. Days of inventory remained basically unchanged at 125. Channel inventory remains lean and is below the low end of our 7 to 8-week target range. Cash from operations was $557 million, and CapEx was only $21 million as we proactively reduced CapEx spend in the current environment. This resulted in free cash flow of $536 million, up 8% year-over-year. 
Our long-term CapEx target remains the same at approximately 4% of sales. And as Vince mentioned, on a trailing 12, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Over the same period, we've returned around $860 million to shareholders via dividends and additional $410 million via buybacks. This equates to a free cash flow return after debt reduction of nearly 80%, which is below our 100% return target as we paused our buyback program. 
Now I'd like to expand on Vince's commentary and discuss how our combination with Maxim will further enhance our financial profile. At deal announcement, ADI and Maxim had a combined pro forma leverage ratio of 1.2x, which will decrease between today and deal close. The main driver being Maxim, which is in cash accumulation phase. They will pay one more quarterly dividend before suspending it for 4 quarters, and their buyback is on pause. Said another way, all the cash generation for the 12 months beginning in the second quarter of their fiscal 2021 will be added to the balance sheet. And for reference, over a trailing 12-month period, Maxim generated $730 million of free cash flow. ADI plans to continue to pay and grow our dividend. And as I mentioned earlier, our buyback program was paused during the height of COVID-19 and will remain on hold for now. When circumstances permit our intentions to reinstate the program, which has nearly $2 billion remaining under authorization. 
Also, as we previously outlined, we plan on repaying $300 million to $500 million of debt in 2020. This quarter, we intend to honor that commitment by retiring our $450 million January 2021 note. This will save $13 million of annual interest expense. We believe the stronger balance sheet provides us with flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long-term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent buybacks and entire aggregated acquisitions. 
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion, plus or minus $70 million. This outlook considers our current understanding of the impact related to the recent legislation enacted on Monday. It's important to remember that this customer's revenue has been significantly reduced over the last year to a low single-digit percent of total sales. We anticipate B2B revenue to decrease modestly for the third quarter, strong growth in automotive as well as growth in industrial is more than offset by a decline in communications. This decline in communications is related to a slowdown of deployment as we forecasted in the last call and the limited impact from the recent legislation. 
On a year-over-year basis, B2B revenue is forecasted to increase low to mid-single digits. We anticipate our operating margin to be approximately 42%, plus or minus 100 bps. We're planning for the tax rate to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus $0.10. 
So now I'll close my remarks by stating that third quarter proved better than our expectations, largely driven by our conservative planning and aggressive execution. As we move through the integration planning process with Maxim, we remain fully committed to driving sustainable growth through cutting-edge innovation and a focus on our customer success. 
I'm going to pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

So at this point in time, the largest 5G customer there in China used to be is no longer part of the planning or the -- either in the short-term or the long term. I'd say as well what we've seen in terms of the strength in China that Prashanth referred to is really is the fact that China was the first, they go into the pandemic. First to come out. It's an economy that's growing very, very rapidly and has been up for several years now. So I think there's been a very good balance, I believe, between supply and demand across all the sectors. I mean, we've seen growth in all markets with the exception of automotive. So I think what we're seeing in terms of the strength in China is more about the match between the strength in our business and the economy than anything else."

Like are we really contemplating a world where Huawei is not going to be a player at all in 5G deployment? And if there is such a world, does it still mean that 5G deployments globally can actually happen at the pace people were thinking about before? Any perspective would be very useful."

In terms of the amount of decline that we are expecting in the communications business, this is a lumpy business. We've said that consistently. It's growth measured in years and lumpy by quarter. We don't give forward guidance on an end market basis by quarter anymore. We haven't done that for a little bit of time. So we don't want to start that now. But take it to understand that the movement in the communications business from third to fourth quarter was very much in normal operating lumpiness of the communications business is not exacerbated in any way by what happened on Monday or Tuesday's announcement.

And if you look at 4G, specifically, just to give you a bit of perspective here, we grew albeit a very, very lumpy business, as we always say, but we grew over the entire era of its build out by mid-single digits we had more content than we had in the prior generations. We took more share. And we're actually even better positioned in 5G because it's a more complex radio problem fundamentally. We have a lot more technology put into the space from microwave and RF, right down to the mixed signal. And now we're attaching power also. So another factor that we're beginning to see the emergence of. So today, 5G has really been about giving more bandwidth to the consumer, more throughput to the consumer. The future is about, I think, B2B more so than the consumer. And we're beginning to see, I believe, the early adoption of 5G in the factory automation area. In fact, I have verified that with some of our industrial automation customers as well. So 3Q is definitely likely the highest revenue quarter this year, but there are lots of drivers at the secular level and the company level to keep us in good stead for growth over the long term."

So we saw strong May, some slowdown in June, which was expected. July was sort of a stable month-over-month, and that was better than we expected. Through August, relatively stable, and August is typically a lower seasonal month. So we have lower backlog in third quarter as we enter the quarter and a good balance between supply and demand. This quarter, as we look forward to our guide, we have -- we've got stronger coverage from backlog than we typically do. And if we converted -- if you recall, in the third quarter, we said that we had about $50 million of products that we couldn't ship in the second quarter that we caught up with in the third quarter. That actually came in a little bit higher because we had fewer cancellations. So we probably had maybe $100 million all in of revenue in third quarter that really related to backlog from second quarter. So I think that through fourth quarter, we're going to get supply and demand back in balance. Backlog has come down and will be more back to normal levels. As we have guided for the fourth quarter, we've taken into consideration the stronger backlog, but we've also taken into consideration that at an ADI level, our book-to-bill for the fourth quarter is now below parity."

This is a question I get a lot and I scratch my head on this, too. Because of you bought linear and then Maxim also on the power side. So the question -- and you did provide us with some details on linear. A couple of questions tied to that. With respect to Hittite, you have given us the growth in Hittite versus what it used to grow and how you have been able to grow that versus prior to acquisition. So the question is, how has Linear done with respect to the core business? And I don't expect you to answer it every quarter, but I think it's a pertinent question in light of the Maxim acquisition. So kind of 2-part question. One, how has Linear done since you bought it? And then this was the year that we were supposed to get revenue synergy. Now this is a very topsy turvy year, so we all understand that. But should we expect revenue synergies to start showing up from Linear with all the efforts that have been going on?"

So we're over 100 basis points of additive growth right now. And if you look at our pipeline, I referred to it in the prepared remarks, we have got a design win pipeline of over $500 million thus far. We have seen wins in communications, both on the wireless side as well as the data center side. Infotainment in automotive, infotainment, radar and, of course, BMS. We're seeing tremendous uptake for some of our more integrated products in areas like instrumentation tests using our micromodule technologies. And I'm quite pleased, given the turmoil in the global markets right now that we continue to see good traction on the design win rates, and I'm confident that we can get from 3% to 4% growth rates in the past to more -- a higher -- mid- to high single-digit level in the future and do it sustainably. So I think we have emerging evidence that we're on good track to do that."

Actually, our book-to-bill was greater than unity across all regions over the last month or so. And we believe that our third quarter represents the bottom of the cycle for us. So I think the near-term recovery and the demand that we're seeing relates to factories coming back on line and also a slow improvement in SAAR. So I think the shape of the recovery really depends on the demand, the end demand for cars and how SAAR actually grows. And we'll -- that will need -- we'll need to see continued vehicle demand to get back to the pre COVID level. So it's not there yet. So factories are coming back on line. Demand is slowly increasing. So hard to call the exact shape, but somewhere between V and U, I guess, or maybe already a U, and we're seeing the upsurge. I would say electric vehicles in general have held up better in this market. As we said in the prepared remarks, there's a strong consumer preference for electric vehicles. It's the fastest-growing sector at this point in time. And we're continuing to gain share in the market. We've seen growth quarter-on-quarter in that space. And we're also very pleased with our performance. A2B actually grew about, I think it was 70% year-to-date. So the adoption, the the design wins that we had gotten last year across most of the OEMs beginning to turn into serious revenue now. And on top of that, we're also overlaying this road noise cancellation technology that uses our digital signal processors, algorithmic technology and different analog support technologies on the input and output there. So those are the major areas. And I think, as I said, I believe we're in a slow recovery phase in automotive. And I think, in general, very hard to call the next quarter, the next 2 quarters. But my sense is '21 will be a growth year for the industry and a growth year for ADI. And I mean that's how I viewed at this point in time. So we're seeing a gentle recovery in general across all our market spaces."

And I would also say that we -- when we look back at the demand activity over the last quarter or 2, we feel very good that, that was driven by very kind of real demand based on conversations with customers. But there was probably some level of inventory building that was going on in there given that the inventory levels at our end customers were so low. Coming into this pandemic, they had taken end customers really at the industrial level, had taken their inventory levels down pretty significantly in 2019. And then the pandemic hit. And so I think some of the strength that the industry is seeing now has a little bit of that renormalizing that. So as we kind of look forward into fourth quarter, there is a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that the new order activity remains good, overdues are declining. So it's -- I think we'll have to let another quarter or 2 rollout. We don't have enough visibility, I think, to tell you what the future portends.

The biggest portion of our Aerospace & Defense business is defense, and that business is holding up well as well as the space business, which continues to grow nicely.

I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.
So I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on our priorities. This includes additional insight, of course, into our recently announced acquisition of Maxim Integrated.
ADI executed exceptionally well in the third quarter despite the highly uncertain environment. Demand was resilient, surpassing our expectations, leading to stronger-than-expected results. We saw continued strength in communications across both wireless and wireline applications, health care saw record demand and other parts of our industrial portfolio such as instrumentation tests also performed well. Unsurprisingly, the main area of weakness was automotive, driven by global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales.
Turning to supply. We're operating at normal capacity, which helped us clear backlog and bring supply and demand into a better balance. Our team delivered third quarter results above the midpoint of our revised guide with revenue at $1.46 billion and EPS at $1.36. B2B revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially, and both gross and operating margins returned within the range of our financial model at 70% and 42%, respectively. We also generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. These results further underscore the strength and flexibility of our business model against any economic backdrop, and I'm proud of how the ADI team continues to deliver for our customers.
Now I'll turn to an update on our strategic priorities. We're focused on spending our capital efficiently, and the first call is funding new product development. During the quarter, we invested approximately $260 million in R&D, with more than 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This continued reinvestment in our business is leading to excellent customer engagements, and let me provide you now with a couple of examples.
In our communications business, we announced the collaboration with Intel to create a flexible radio platform that will enable customers to scale their 5G networks more quickly and more economically. The high-performance ORAN compliance solution leverages our market-leading software-defined transceiver technologies. This positions ADI to expand our market leadership.
In automotive, our new road noise canceling solution is gaining traction. Since announcing our initial win with Hyundai in February, we've added 5 more customers, including the North American leader in electric vehicles. This innovative solution reduces the car weights by almost 100 pounds and energy requirements by about 3%, while potentially doubling our content opportunity per vehicle. We're seeing great design momentum across our diversified industrial market also. For example, in factory automation, customers are rethinking supply chains to make them more flexible with faster response times. And to quicken the pace of adoption, we have formed an alliance of partners to develop an open source architecture. I'm excited to announce a Fortune 500 health care customer is teaming with ADI to help upgrade its manufacturing capabilities using more connected robotics, thereby doubling our addressable market.
And in space, we have design wins going to production this year with traditional aerospace companies and new emerging disruptors that enable the proliferation of next-generation communication satellites. These satellites continuously change their position to earth and require space grade phased array and beam forming technology to create an uninterrupted connection. And we're using this strong position in RF to attach power technologies, thereby increasing our addressable market by 1/3.
ADI also remains committed to strong shareholder returns. This quarter, we returned approximately $230 million through dividends. Recall that we paused share buybacks due to the pandemic. This has helped us further solidify our balance sheet with a cash balance of more than $1 billion.
At this point, I'd be remiss to not discuss our M&A strategy in the light of the Maxim acquisition. ADI selectively uses M&A to expand both our scale and our scope in order to better address the future needs of our customers and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And while cost synergies are an important element in evaluating any acquisition, from our perspective, the most compelling benefits come from combining technology portfolios to capture new addressable markets and drive on term revenue synergies. This revenue takes time to realize, given the nature of the Analog business, but our products deliver recurring revenue streams and cash flow for decades. Therefore, we strive to achieve our return objective within approximately 5 years. This time frame allows us to not only achieve the stated cost savings but also begin to capture the early revenue synergies. And I think the acquisition of LTC illustrates the benefits of our strategy.
Our top priorities there were harmonizing the 2 organizations to create an entity that is better than the sum of its parts. To that end, I'm proud to say that we've retained and invested in LTC's exceptional engineering talent. Together, we've created an exciting road map of high-performance analog and power solutions combined. We're exceeding our original $150 million cost synergy target, and we're on track to realize the next $100 million exiting fiscal '21.
And from a revenue perspective, we've more than doubled our pipeline value, and we have over $500 million of lifetime revenue coming to market this year, increasing our confidence in doubling LTC's historical growth rate. With LTC complete, we pursued the acquisition of Maxim to strengthen our leadership in the analog industry, better positioning ADI to capitalize on secular growth trends.
Over the last 5 years, Maxim has shifted its business strategy to focus on B2B markets while enhancing profitability. As a result, Maxim has increased its B2B revenue mix to approximately 80% of total from 55%, expanded its gross margins by more than 500 basis points and increased its free cash flow margin by over 600 basis points during this period. Combined, we're confident we will continue to improve Maxim's performance. This will be driven by our cadre of engineering talent, complementary technologies and breadth of market applications that I'd like to expand on a little here. The cultures of ADI and Maxim are very aligned. Both companies share a commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. With a combined team of more than 10,000 engineers and $1.5 billion of annual R&D investment, we will continue to be the destination for the world's best analog talent. And with 3x the field technical resources, we'll be better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support.
In the area of power management, Maxim's application-focused offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. Together, we will have a more comprehensive power portfolio with approximately $2 billion of revenue. This is particularly important as power is the largest and fastest-growing Analog subsegment and with increasing design complexity and the need for better efficiency, the system power challenges that our customers must overcome continue to rise and rise.
In automotive, Maxim has one of the premier franchisees, increasing revenue at a mid-teens rate over the last 5 years. They're a leader in high-speed data connectivity for cameras, radars and processors with serial link technology while ADI is a leader in audio solutions with our A2B platform, and both companies are well positioned in vehicle electrification, enabling us to better address automakers' EV requirements, which continuously evolve. Together, we will capture more of the increasing system content per vehicle and enable a better experience for the consumer.
Taking a step back, the combined company will have unique positioning with 85% exposure to highly profitable long life B2B markets. Maxim's strengths in the automotive and data center markets will complement ADI's strengths across the industrial, communications and digital health care markets. Additionally, the combined company will have increased financial strength. We expect the combination to be accretive to adjusted EPS within 18 months post close, with targeted cost synergies of $275 million by the end of the second year. We also expect to maintain an industry-leading financial profile. As always, we are committed to generating robust free cash flow, and our goal is to reach the high end of our margin range of 40%.
With our lower leverage ratio at close, we'll also have the opportunity to deliver enhanced cash returns to our shareholders. And I believe that together, we can grow revenue at mid-single digits due to our alignment with important secular growth trends, such as Industry 4.0, digital health care, next-generation communication systems and vehicle electrification as examples.
So in closing, we're seeing promising evidence that a broad-based recovery is underway. However, we recognize that the recovery is highly dependent on the future impacts of the pandemic. We've used this unprecedented time to better align our organization and investments into the most important areas. We believe we'll emerge stronger and are better positioned to drive profitable growth. And as I've shared today, we're very excited about the combination with Maxim, which will drive the next wave of disruptive innovation and deliver significant benefits for all stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Prashanth to go through the financial details and outlook."

Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.When we",1267,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
When we provided quarterly guidance in May, we were facing tremendous uncertainty, just returning to normal capacity levels and experiencing volatile demand patterns across end markets. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand that resulted in less cancellations and higher-than-anticipated backlog conversion. With that as context, our results came in above the midpoint of our revised outlook, with revenue of $1.46 billion, operating margins over 42% and EPS of $1.36.
Let me start now with the end market color. Our B2B revenue was up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year as strength across industrial and communications offset a sharp decline in automotive. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 3% year-over-year. We experienced robust growth in health care, instrumentation test and energy applications. This strength was moderated by weaker trends across our broad market and automation businesses. Communications, which accounted for 25% of revenue, achieved a record quarter. Revenue finished up 14% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases across both wireless and wireline. This strength came from our leadership position in 5G wireless systems and our solid position in optical connectivity used in carrier networks and data centers.
Automotive, which represented 11% of revenue, decreased 29% year-over-year, with all applications declining due to global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. And while no business is immune to the current environment, our BMS and A2B solutions fared quite well. BMS revenue increased sequentially and was down just modestly year-over-year due to our strong penetration across the ecosystem and increasing consumer preference for electric vehicles. And given the continued adoption of our A2B audio platform, A2B revenue has increased over 70% year-to-date despite lower vehicle sales.
Consumer, which also represented 11% of revenue, was down 13% year-over-year. Relatively flat portable revenue was more than offset by double-digit declines in prosumer due to the pandemic-related softness. We continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer business.
In addition to the end market commentary, we wanted to provide some insight by geography as we believe it is helpful to investors in this current climate. Most geographies declined year-over-year. We saw double-digit declines in Europe and Japan, while the decline in North America was less pronounced. The rest of Asia increased and China increased double digits year-over-year, largely driven by the robust growth in communications, given our solid position as well as strength in industrial.
Now moving on to the P&L. Gross margins returned to our model at approximately 70%, down modestly year-over-year from lower fab utilization. We've accelerated the planned LTC factory closings and have started to realize these benefits in the third quarter. We expect additional savings in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit fiscal 2020 with nearly half of the $100 million savings in our run rate.
OpEx was $402 million, up 3% sequentially, yet down 8% year-over-year. We maintained a focus on controlling expenses, which included a 1-week global shutdown during the quarter. OP margins finished at 42.3%, the highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Nonop expenses were $46 million, down $3 million sequentially and more than $10 million year-over-year, driven by lower levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11.5%, and all told, third quarter EPS came in at $1.36.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and about $5.6 billion in total debt. This resulted in a leverage ratio of 1.8x on a trailing 12-month basis. Inventory dollars increased $22 million sequentially, but declined year-over-year. Days of inventory remained basically unchanged at 125. Channel inventory remains lean and is below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target range. Cash from operations was $557 million, and CapEx was only $21 million as we proactively reduced CapEx spend in the current environment. This resulted in free cash flow of $536 million, up 8% year-over-year.
Our long-term CapEx target remains the same at approximately 4% of sales. And as Vince mentioned, on a trailing 12, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Over the same period, we've returned around $860 million to shareholders via dividends and additional $410 million via buybacks. This equates to a free cash flow return after debt reduction of nearly 80%, which is below our 100% return target as we paused our buyback program. 
Now I'd like to expand on Vince's commentary and discuss how our combination with Maxim will further enhance our financial profile. At deal announcement, ADI and Maxim had a combined pro forma leverage ratio of 1.2x, which will decrease between today and deal close. The main driver being Maxim, which is in cash accumulation phase. They will pay one more quarterly dividend before suspending it for 4 quarters, and their buyback is on pause. Said another way, all the cash generation for the 12 months beginning in the second quarter of their fiscal 2021 will be added to the balance sheet. And for reference, over a trailing 12-month period, Maxim generated $730 million of free cash flow. ADI plans to continue to pay and grow our dividend. And as I mentioned earlier, our buyback program was paused during the height of COVID-19 and will remain on hold for now. When circumstances permit, our intention is to reinstate the program, which has nearly $2 billion remaining under authorization.
Also, as we previously outlined, we plan on repaying $300 million to $500 million of debt in 2020. This quarter, we intend to honor that commitment by retiring our $450 million January 2021 note. This will save $13 million of annual interest expense. We believe the stronger balance sheet provides us with flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent buybacks and entire aggregated acquisitions.
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion, plus or minus $70 million. This outlook considers our current understanding of the impact related to the recent legislation enacted on Monday. It's important to remember that this customer's revenue has been significantly reduced over the last year to a low single-digit percent of total sales. We anticipate B2B revenue to decrease modestly for the third quarter. Strong growth in automotive as well as growth in industrial is more than offset by a decline in communications. This decline in communications is related to a slowdown of deployment as we forecasted in the last call and the limited impact from the recent legislation.
On a year-over-year basis, B2B revenue is forecasted to increase low to mid-single digits. We anticipate our operating margin to be approximately 42%, plus or minus 100 bps. We're planning for the tax rate to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus $0.10.
So now I'll close my remarks by stating that third quarter proved better than our expectations, largely driven by our conservative planning and aggressive execution. As we move through the integration planning process with Maxim, we remain fully committed to driving sustainable growth through cutting-edge innovation and a focus on our customer success.
I'm going to pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

It has been a low single-digit customer over the past few quarters. So we have factored also, by the way, the latest regulatory upheaval into our numbers. So at this point in time, the largest 5G customer there in China that used to be is no longer part of the planning or the -- either in the short term or the long term. I'd say as well what we've seen in terms of the strength in China that Prashanth referred to is really -- is the fact that China was the first to go into the pandemic. First to come out. It's an economy that's growing very, very rapidly and has been up for several years now. So I think there's been a very good balance, I believe, between supply and demand across all the sectors. I mean, we've seen growth in all markets with the exception of automotive. So I think what we're seeing in terms of the strength in China is more about the match between the strength in our business and the economy than anything else."

Like, are we really contemplating a world where Huawei is not going to be a player at all in 5G deployment? And if there is such a world, does it still mean that 5G deployments globally can actually happen at the pace people were thinking about before? Any perspective would be very useful."

In terms of the amount of decline that we are expecting in the communications business, this is a lumpy business. We've said that consistently. It's growth measured in years and lumpy by quarter. We don't give forward guidance on an end market basis by quarter anymore. We haven't done that for a little bit of time. So we don't want to start that now. But take it to understand that the movement in the communications business from third to fourth quarter was very much in normal operating lumpiness of the communications business is not exacerbated in any way by what happened on Monday or Tuesday's announcement.

And if you look at 4G, specifically, just to give you a bit of perspective here, we grew, albeit a very, very lumpy business, as we always say, but we grew over the entire era of its build out by mid-single digits. We had more content than we had in the prior generations. We took more share. And we're actually even better positioned in 5G because it's a more complex radio problem fundamentally. We have a lot more technology to put into the space from microwave and RF, right down to the mixed signal. And now we're attaching power also. So another factor that we're beginning to see the emergence of. So today, 5G has really been about giving more bandwidth to the consumer, more throughput to the consumer. The future is about, I think, B2B more so than the consumer. And we're beginning to see, I believe, the early adoption of 5G in the factory automation area. In fact, I have verified that with some of our industrial automation customers as well. So 3Q is definitely likely the highest revenue quarter this year, but there are lots of drivers at the secular level and the company level to keep us in good stead for growth over the long term."

So we saw strong May, some slowdown in June, which was expected. July was sort of a stable month-over-month, and that was better than we expected. Through August, relatively stable, and August is typically a lower seasonal month. So we have lower backlog in third quarter as we enter the quarter and a good balance between supply and demand. This quarter, as we look forward to our guide, we've got stronger coverage from backlog than we typically do. And if we converted -- if you recall, in the third quarter, we said that we had about $50 million of products that we couldn't ship in the second quarter that we caught up with in the third quarter. That actually came in a little bit higher because we had fewer cancellations. So we probably had maybe $100 million all in of revenue in third quarter that really related to backlog from second quarter. So I think that through fourth quarter, we're going to get supply and demand back in balance. Backlog has come down and will be more back to normal levels. As we have guided for the fourth quarter, we've taken into consideration the stronger backlog, but we've also taken into consideration that at an ADI level, our book-to-bill for the fourth quarter is now below parity."

With respect to Hittite, you have given us the growth in Hittite versus what it used to grow and how you have been able to grow that versus prior to acquisition. So the question is, how has Linear done with respect to the core business? And I don't expect you to answer it every quarter, but I think it's a pertinent question in light of the Maxim acquisition. So kind of 2-part question. One, how has Linear done since you bought it?
And then this was the year that we were supposed to get revenue synergy. Now this is a very topsy-turvy year, so we all understand that. But should we expect revenue synergies to start showing up from Linear with all the efforts that have been going on?"

So we're over 100 basis points of additive growth right now.
And if you look at our pipeline, I referred to it in the prepared remarks, we have got a design win pipeline of over $0.5 billion thus far. We have seen wins in communications, both on the wireless side as well as the data center side. Infotainment in automotive, infotainment, radar and, of course, BMS. We're seeing tremendous uptake for some of our more integrated products in areas like instrumentation tests using our micromodule technologies. And I'm quite pleased, given the turmoil in the global markets right now that we continue to see good traction on the design win rates, and I'm confident that we can get from 3% to 4% growth rates in the past to more -- a higher -- mid- to high single-digit level in the future and do it sustainably.

Actually, our book-to-bill was greater than unity across all regions over the last month or so. And we believe that our third quarter represents the bottom of the cycle for us. So I think the near-term recovery and the demand that we're seeing relates to factories coming back online and also a slow improvement in SAAR. So I think the shape of the recovery really depends on the demand -- the end demand for cars and how SAAR actually grows. And we'll -- that will need -- we'll need to see continued vehicle demand to get back to the pre-COVID level. So it's not there yet. So factories are coming back online. Demand is slowly increasing. So hard to call the exact shape, but somewhere between a V and a U, I guess, or maybe already a U, and we're seeing the upsurge.
I would say electric vehicles in general have held up better in this market. As we said in the prepared remarks, there's a strong consumer preference for electric vehicles. It's the fastest-growing sector at this point in time. And we're continuing to gain share in the market. We've seen growth quarter-on-quarter in that space. And we're also very pleased with our performance. A2B actually grew about, I think it was 70% year-to-date. So the adoption, the design wins that we had gotten last year across most of the OEMs beginning to turn into serious revenue now. And on top of that, we're also overlaying this road noise cancellation technology that uses our digital signal processors, algorithmic technology and different analog support technologies on the input and output there. So those are the major areas. And I think, as I said, I believe we're in a slow recovery phase in automotive. And I think, in general, very hard to call the next quarter, the next 2 quarters, but my sense is '21 will be a growth year for the industry and a growth year for ADI. And -- I mean that's how I viewed at this point in time. So we're seeing a gentle recovery in general across all our market spaces."

The -- so I would say that certainly, the communications business is a piece of that. And I would also say that we -- when we look back at the demand activity over the last quarter or 2, we feel very good that, that was driven by very kind of real demand based on conversations with customers. But there was probably some level of inventory building that was going on in there given that the inventory levels at our end customers were so low. Coming into this pandemic, they had taken -- end customers really at the industrial level, had taken their inventory levels down pretty significantly in 2019. And then the pandemic hit. And so I think some of the strength that the industry is seeing now has a little bit of that renormalizing that. So as we kind of look forward into fourth quarter, there is a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that the new order activity remains good, overdues are declining. So it's -- I think we'll have to let another quarter or 2 roll out. We don't have enough visibility, I think, to tell you what the future portends. But we're not seeing a sharp decline in order activity, but it is below 1."

I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.
So I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on our priorities. This includes additional insight, of course, into our recently announced acquisition of Maxim Integrated.
ADI executed exceptionally well in the third quarter despite the highly uncertain environment. Demand was resilient, surpassing our expectations, leading to stronger-than-expected results. We saw continued strength in communications across both wireless and wireline applications, health care saw record demand and other parts of our industrial portfolio such as instrumentation tests also performed well. Unsurprisingly, the main area of weakness was automotive, driven by global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales.
Turning to supply. We're operating at normal capacity, which helped us clear backlog and bring supply and demand into a better balance. Our team delivered third quarter results above the midpoint of our revised guide with revenue at $1.46 billion and EPS at $1.36. B2B revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially, and both gross and operating margins returned within the range of our financial model at 70% and 42%, respectively. We also generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. These results further underscore the strength and flexibility of our business model against any economic backdrop, and I'm proud of how the ADI team continues to deliver for our customers.
Now I'll turn to an update on our strategic priorities. We're focused on spending our capital efficiently, and the first call is funding new product development. During the quarter, we invested approximately $260 million in R&D, with more than 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This continued reinvestment in our business is leading to excellent customer engagements, and let me provide you now with a couple of examples.
In our communications business, we announced the collaboration with Intel to create a flexible radio platform that will enable customers to scale their 5G networks more quickly and more economically. The high-performance O-RAN compliant solution leverages our market-leading software-defined transceiver technologies. This positions ADI to expand our market leadership.
In automotive, our new road noise canceling solution is gaining traction. Since announcing our initial win with Hyundai in February, we've added 5 more customers, including the North American leader in electric vehicles. This innovative solution reduces the car weights by almost 100 pounds and energy requirements by about 3%, while potentially doubling our content opportunity per vehicle. We're seeing great design momentum across our diversified industrial market also. For example, in factory automation, customers are rethinking supply chains to make them more flexible with faster response times. And to quicken the pace of adoption, we have formed an alliance of partners to develop an open source architecture. I'm excited to announce a Fortune 500 health care customer is teaming with ADI to help upgrade its manufacturing capabilities using more connected robotics, thereby doubling our addressable market.
And in space, we have design wins going to production this year with traditional aerospace companies and new emerging disruptors that enable the proliferation of next-generation communication satellites. These satellites continuously change their position to earth and require space grade phased array and beam forming technology to create an uninterrupted connection. And we're using this strong position in RF to attach power technologies, thereby increasing our addressable market by 1/3.
ADI also remains committed to strong shareholder returns. This quarter, we returned approximately $230 million through dividends. Recall that we paused share buybacks due to the pandemic. This has helped us further solidify our balance sheet with a cash balance of more than $1 billion.
At this point, I'd be remiss to not discuss our M&A strategy in the light of the Maxim acquisition. ADI selectively uses M&A to expand both our scale and our scope in order to better address the future needs of our customers and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And while cost synergies are an important element in evaluating any acquisition, from our perspective, the most compelling benefits come from combining technology portfolios to capture new addressable markets and drive on term revenue synergies. This revenue takes time to realize, given the nature of the Analog business, but our products deliver recurring revenue streams and cash flow for decades. Therefore, we strive to achieve our return objective within approximately 5 years. This time frame allows us to not only achieve the stated cost savings but also begin to capture the early revenue synergies. And I think the acquisition of LTC illustrates the benefits of our strategy.
Our top priorities there were harmonizing the 2 organizations to create an entity that is better than the sum of its parts. To that end, I'm proud to say that we've retained and invested in LTC's exceptional engineering talent. Together, we've created an exciting road map of high-performance analog and power solutions combined. We're exceeding our original $150 million cost synergy target, and we're on track to realize the next $100 million exiting fiscal '21.
And from a revenue perspective, we've more than doubled our pipeline value, and we have over $500 million of lifetime revenue coming to market this year, increasing our confidence in doubling LTC's historical growth rate. With LTC complete, we pursued the acquisition of Maxim to strengthen our leadership in the analog industry, better positioning ADI to capitalize on secular growth trends.
Over the last 5 years, Maxim has shifted its business strategy to focus on B2B markets while enhancing profitability. As a result, Maxim has increased its B2B revenue mix to approximately 80% of total from 55%, expanded its gross margins by more than 500 basis points and increased its free cash flow margin by over 600 basis points during this period. Combined, we're confident we will continue to improve Maxim's performance. This will be driven by our cadre of engineering talent, complementary technologies and breadth of market applications that I'd like to expand on a little here. The cultures of ADI and Maxim are very aligned. Both companies share a commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. With a combined team of more than 10,000 engineers and $1.5 billion of annual R&D investment, we will continue to be the destination for the world's best analog talent. And with 3x the field technical resources, we'll be better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support.
In the area of power management, Maxim's application-focused offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. Together, we will have a more comprehensive power portfolio with approximately $2 billion of revenue. This is particularly important as power is the largest and fastest-growing Analog subsegment and with increasing design complexity and the need for better efficiency, the system power challenges that our customers must overcome continue to rise and rise.
In automotive, Maxim has one of the premier franchisees, increasing revenue at a mid-teens rate over the last 5 years. They're a leader in high-speed data connectivity for cameras, radars and processors with serial link technology while ADI is a leader in audio solutions with our A2B platform, and both companies are well positioned in vehicle electrification, enabling us to better address automakers' EV requirements, which continuously evolve. Together, we will capture more of the increasing system content per vehicle and enable a better experience for the consumer.
Taking a step back, the combined company will have unique positioning with 85% exposure to highly profitable long life B2B markets. Maxim's strengths in the automotive and data center markets will complement ADI's strengths across the industrial, communications and digital health care markets. Additionally, the combined company will have increased financial strength. We expect the combination to be accretive to adjusted EPS within 18 months post close, with targeted cost synergies of $275 million by the end of the second year. We also expect to maintain an industry-leading financial profile. As always, we are committed to generating robust free cash flow, and our goal is to reach the high end of our margin range of 40%.
With our lower leverage ratio at close, we'll also have the opportunity to deliver enhanced cash returns to our shareholders. And I believe that together, we can grow revenue at mid-single digits due to our alignment with important secular growth trends, such as Industry 4.0, digital health care, next-generation communication systems and vehicle electrification as examples.
So in closing, we're seeing promising evidence that a broad-based recovery is underway. However, we recognize that the recovery is highly dependent on the future impacts of the pandemic. We've used this unprecedented time to better align our organization and investments into the most important areas. We believe we'll emerge stronger and are better positioned to drive profitable growth. And as I've shared today, we're very excited about the combination with Maxim, which will drive the next wave of disruptive innovation and deliver significant benefits for all stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Prashanth to go through the financial details and outlook."

Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
When we provided quarterly guidance in May, we were facing tremendous uncertainty, just returning to normal capacity levels and experiencing volatile demand patterns across end markets. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand that resulted in less cancellations and higher-than-anticipated backlog conversion. With that as context, our results came in above the midpoint of our revised outlook, with revenue of $1.46 billion, operating margins over 42% and EPS of $1.36.
Let me start now with the end market color. Our B2B revenue was up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year as strength across industrial and communications offset a sharp decline in automotive. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 3% year-over-year. We experienced robust growth in health care, instrumentation test and energy applications. This strength was moderated by weaker trends across our broad market and automation businesses. Communications, which accounted for 25% of revenue, achieved a record quarter. Revenue finished up 14% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases across both wireless and wireline. This strength came from our leadership position in 5G wireless systems and our solid position in optical connectivity used in carrier networks and data centers.
Automotive, which represented 11% of revenue, decreased 29% year-over-year, with all applications declining due to global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. And while no business is immune to the current environment, our BMS and A2B solutions fared quite well. BMS revenue increased sequentially and was down just modestly year-over-year due to our strong penetration across the ecosystem and increasing consumer preference for electric vehicles. And given the continued adoption of our A2B audio platform, A2B revenue has increased over 70% year-to-date despite lower vehicle sales.
Consumer, which also represented 11% of revenue, was down 13% year-over-year. Relatively flat portable revenue was more than offset by double-digit declines in prosumer due to the pandemic-related softness. We continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer business.
In addition to the end market commentary, we wanted to provide some insight by geography as we believe it is helpful to investors in this current climate. Most geographies declined year-over-year. We saw double-digit declines in Europe and Japan, while the decline in North America was less pronounced. The rest of Asia increased and China increased double digits year-over-year, largely driven by the robust growth in communications, given our solid position as well as strength in industrial.
Now moving on to the P&L. Gross margins returned to our model at approximately 70%, down modestly year-over-year from lower fab utilization. We've accelerated the planned LTC factory closings and have started to realize these benefits in the third quarter. We expect additional savings in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit fiscal 2020 with nearly half of the $100 million savings in our run rate.
OpEx was $402 million, up 3% sequentially, yet down 8% year-over-year. We maintained a focus on controlling expenses, which included a 1-week global shutdown during the quarter. OP margins finished at 42.3%, the highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Nonop expenses were $46 million, down $3 million sequentially and more than $10 million year-over-year, driven by lower levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11.5%, and all told, third quarter EPS came in at $1.36.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and about $5.6 billion in total debt. This resulted in a leverage ratio of 1.8x on a trailing 12-month basis. Inventory dollars increased $22 million sequentially, but declined year-over-year. Days of inventory remained basically unchanged at 125. Channel inventory remains lean and is below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target range. Cash from operations was $557 million, and CapEx was only $21 million as we proactively reduced CapEx spend in the current environment. This resulted in free cash flow of $536 million, up 8% year-over-year.
Our long-term CapEx target remains the same at approximately 4% of sales. And as Vince mentioned, on a trailing 12, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Over the same period, we've returned around $860 million to shareholders via dividends and additional $410 million via buybacks. This equates to a free cash flow return after debt reduction of nearly 80%, which is below our 100% return target as we paused our buyback program. 
Now I'd like to expand on Vince's commentary and discuss how our combination with Maxim will further enhance our financial profile. At deal announcement, ADI and Maxim had a combined pro forma leverage ratio of 1.2x, which will decrease between today and deal close. The main driver being Maxim, which is in cash accumulation phase. They will pay one more quarterly dividend before suspending it for 4 quarters, and their buyback is on pause. Said another way, all the cash generation for the 12 months beginning in the second quarter of their fiscal 2021 will be added to the balance sheet. And for reference, over a trailing 12-month period, Maxim generated $730 million of free cash flow. ADI plans to continue to pay and grow our dividend. And as I mentioned earlier, our buyback program was paused during the height of COVID-19 and will remain on hold for now. When circumstances permit, our intention is to reinstate the program, which has nearly $2 billion remaining under authorization.
Also, as we previously outlined, we plan on repaying $300 million to $500 million of debt in 2020. This quarter, we intend to honor that commitment by retiring our $450 million January 2021 note. This will save $13 million of annual interest expense. We believe the stronger balance sheet provides us with flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion, plus or minus $70 million. This outlook considers our current understanding of the impact related to the recent legislation enacted on Monday. It's important to remember that this customer's revenue has been significantly reduced over the last year to a low single-digit percent of total sales. We anticipate B2B revenue to decrease modestly for the third quarter. Strong growth in automotive as well as growth in industrial is more than offset by a decline in communications. This decline in communications is related to a slowdown of deployment as we forecasted in the last call and the limited impact from the recent legislation.
On a year-over-year basis, B2B revenue is forecasted to increase low to mid-single digits. We anticipate our operating margin to be approximately 42%, plus or minus 100 bps. We're planning for the tax rate to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus $0.10.
So now I'll close my remarks by stating that third quarter proved better than our expectations, largely driven by our conservative planning and aggressive execution. As we move through the integration planning process with Maxim, we remain fully committed to driving sustainable growth through cutting-edge innovation and a focus on our customer success.
I'm going to pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

So we have pretty much discounted our top -- what used to be our #1 customer in China to pretty much 0 in our long-term planning thinking. It has been a low single-digit customer over the past few quarters. So we have factored also, by the way, the latest regulatory upheaval into our numbers. So at this point in time, the largest 5G customer there in China that used to be is no longer part of the planning or the -- either in the short term or the long term. I'd say as well what we've seen in terms of the strength in China that Prashanth referred to is really -- is the fact that China was the first to go into the pandemic. First to come out. It's an economy that's growing very, very rapidly and has been up for several years now. So I think there's been a very good balance, I believe, between supply and demand across all the sectors. I mean we've seen growth in all markets with the exception of automotive. So I think what we're seeing in terms of the strength in China is more about the match between the strength in our business and the economy than anything else."

And I was hoping, Vince, if you could help us quantify how much communications could perhaps decline sequentially? And what are you baking in from this Department of Commerce regulation? And then I think that the bigger question there is that as we look forward to next year, do you think global 5G deployments can stay on track if Huawei doesn't get access to U.S. technology? Like, are we really contemplating a world where Huawei is not going to be a player at all in 5G deployment? And if there is such a world, does it still mean that 5G deployments globally can actually happen at the pace people were thinking about before? Any perspective would be very useful."

We don't give forward guidance on an end market basis by quarter anymore. We haven't done that for a little bit of time. So we don't want to start that now. But take it to understand that the movement in the communications business from third to fourth quarter was very much in normal operating lumpiness of the communications business is not exacerbated in any way by what happened on Monday or Tuesday's announcement.

So Vivek, I've been in this business a long, long time actually since 2 -- the inception of 2G, all those years ago back in the late 80s, early 90s and what I can tell you is that the patterns we're seeing in 5G are no different to what we've seen in 2G, 3G or 4G. And if you look at 4G, specifically, just to give you a bit of perspective here, we grew, albeit a very, very lumpy business, as we always say, but we grew over the entire era of its build out by mid-single digits. We had more content than we had in the prior generations. We took more share. And we're actually even better positioned in 5G because it's a more complex radio problem fundamentally. We have a lot more technology to put into the space from microwave and RF, right down to the mixed signal. And now we're attaching power also. So another factor that we're beginning to see the emergence of. So today, 5G has really been about giving more bandwidth to the consumer, more throughput to the consumer. The future is about, I think, B2B more so than the consumer. And we're beginning to see, I believe, the early adoption of 5G in the factory automation area. In fact, I have verified that with some of our industrial automation customers as well. So 3Q is definitely likely the highest revenue quarter this year, but there are lots of drivers at the secular level and the company level to keep us in good stead for growth over the long term."

So we saw strong May, some slowdown in June, which was expected. July was sort of a stable month-over-month, and that was better than we expected. Through August, relatively stable, and August is typically a lower seasonal month. So we have lower backlog in third quarter as we enter the quarter and a good balance between supply and demand. This quarter, as we look forward to our guide, we've got stronger coverage from backlog than we typically do. And if we converted -- if you recall, in the third quarter, we said that we had about $50 million of products that we couldn't ship in the second quarter that we caught up with in the third quarter. That actually came in a little bit higher because we had fewer cancellations. So we probably had maybe $100 million all in of revenue in third quarter that really related to backlog from second quarter. So I think that through fourth quarter, we're going to get supply and demand back in balance. Backlog has come down and will be more back to normal levels. As we have guided for the fourth quarter, we've taken into consideration the stronger backlog, but we've also taken into consideration that at an ADI level, our book-to-bill for the fourth quarter is now below parity."

This is a question I get a lot and I scratch my head on this too because of you bought Linear and then Maxim also on the power side. So the question -- and you did provide us with some details on Linear. A couple of questions tied to that. With respect to Hittite, you have given us the growth in Hittite versus what it used to grow and how you have been able to grow that versus prior to acquisition. So the question is, how has Linear done with respect to the core business? And I don't expect you to answer it every quarter, but I think it's a pertinent question in light of the Maxim acquisition. So kind of 2-part question. One, how has Linear done since you bought it?
And then this was the year that we were supposed to get revenue synergy. Now this is a very topsy-turvy year, so we all understand that. But should we expect revenue synergies to start showing up from Linear with all the efforts that have been going on?"

I would say, at this point in time, we've put more than 100 basis points of growth on the base Linear growth rate to date. We have -- I think the greatest indicator for what things are likely to be in the future, I've said before that I believe that we can double the growth rate of LT over the longer term, and just given the markets in which we play and the design cycles, the product cycles, it takes 3 years minimum, and then you begin to see the real benefits, I think, after 5 years. So we're over 100 basis points of additive growth right now.
And if you look at our pipeline, I referred to it in the prepared remarks, we have got a design win pipeline of over $0.5 billion thus far. We have seen wins in communications, both on the wireless side as well as the data center side. Infotainment in automotive, infotainment, radar and, of course, BMS. We're seeing tremendous uptake for some of our more integrated products in areas like instrumentation tests using our micromodule technologies. And I'm quite pleased, given the turmoil in the global markets right now that we continue to see good traction on the design win rates, and I'm confident that we can get from 3% to 4% growth rates in the past to more -- a higher -- mid- to high single-digit level in the future and do it sustainably. So I think we have emerging evidence that we're on good track to do that."

Actually, our book-to-bill was greater than unity across all regions over the last month or so. And we believe that our third quarter represents the bottom of the cycle for us. So I think the near-term recovery and the demand that we're seeing relates to factories coming back online and also a slow improvement in SAAR. So I think the shape of the recovery really depends on the demand -- the end demand for cars and how SAAR actually grows. And we'll -- that will need -- we'll need to see continued vehicle demand to get back to the pre-COVID level. So it's not there yet. So factories are coming back online. Demand is slowly increasing. So hard to call the exact shape, but somewhere between a V and a U, I guess, or maybe already a U, and we're seeing the upsurge.
I would say electric vehicles in general have held up better in this market. As we said in the prepared remarks, there's a strong consumer preference for electric vehicles. It's the fastest-growing sector at this point in time. And we're continuing to gain share in the market. We've seen growth quarter-on-quarter in that space. And we're also very pleased with our performance. A2B actually grew about, I think it was 70% year-to-date. So the adoption, the design wins that we had gotten last year across most of the OEMs beginning to turn into serious revenue now. And on top of that, we're also overlaying this road noise cancellation technology that uses our digital signal processors, algorithmic technology and different analog support technologies on the input and output there. So those are the major areas. And I think, as I said, I believe we're in a slow recovery phase in automotive. And I think, in general, very hard to call the next quarter, the next 2 quarters, but my sense is '21 will be a growth year for the industry and a growth year for ADI. And -- I mean that's how I viewed at this point in time. So we're seeing a gentle recovery in general across all our market spaces."

The -- so I would say that certainly, the communications business is a piece of that. And I would also say that we -- when we look back at the demand activity over the last quarter or 2, we feel very good that, that was driven by very kind of real demand based on conversations with customers. But there was probably some level of inventory building that was going on in there given that the inventory levels at our end customers were so low. Coming into this pandemic, they had taken -- end customers really at the industrial level, had taken their inventory levels down pretty significantly in 2019. And then the pandemic hit. And so I think some of the strength that the industry is seeing now has a little bit of that renormalizing that. So as we kind of look forward into fourth quarter, there is a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that the new order activity remains good, overdues are declining. So it's -- I think we'll have to let another quarter or 2 roll out. We don't have enough visibility, I think, to tell you what the future portends.

The biggest portion of our aerospace and defense business is defense, and that business is holding up well as well as the space business, which continues to grow nicely.
I would say as well, automation is holding better than we had thought.

I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.So I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on",1542,"Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.
So I'll start my remarks today on our quarterly results and the current operating environment before providing you with an update on our priorities. This includes additional insight, of course, into our recently announced acquisition of Maxim Integrated.
ADI executed exceptionally well in the third quarter despite the highly uncertain environment. Demand was resilient, surpassing our expectations, leading to stronger-than-expected results. We saw continued strength in communications across both wireless and wireline applications, health care saw record demand and other parts of our industrial portfolio such as instrumentation tests also performed well. Unsurprisingly, the main area of weakness was automotive, driven by global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales.
Turning to supply. We're operating at normal capacity, which helped us clear backlog and bring supply and demand into a better balance. Our team delivered third quarter results above the midpoint of our revised guide with revenue at $1.46 billion and EPS at $1.36. B2B revenue was flat year-over-year and increased 11% sequentially, and both gross and operating margins returned within the range of our financial model at 70% and 42%, respectively. We also generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue over the trailing 12 months. This continues to place ADI in the top 10% of the S&P 500. These results further underscore the strength and flexibility of our business model against any economic backdrop, and I'm proud of how the ADI team continues to deliver for our customers.
Now I'll turn to an update on our strategic priorities. We're focused on spending our capital efficiently, and the first call is funding new product development. During the quarter, we invested approximately $260 million in R&D, with more than 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This continued reinvestment in our business is leading to excellent customer engagements, and let me provide you now with a couple of examples.
In our communications business, we announced the collaboration with Intel to create a flexible radio platform that will enable customers to scale their 5G networks more quickly and more economically. The high-performance O-RAN compliant solution leverages our market-leading software-defined transceiver technologies. This positions ADI to expand our market leadership.
In automotive, our new road noise canceling solution is gaining traction. Since announcing our initial win with Hyundai in February, we've added 5 more customers, including the North American leader in electric vehicles. This innovative solution reduces the car weights by almost 100 pounds and energy requirements by about 3%, while potentially doubling our content opportunity per vehicle. We're seeing great design momentum across our diversified industrial market also. For example, in factory automation, customers are rethinking supply chains to make them more flexible with faster response times. And to quicken the pace of adoption, we have formed an alliance of partners to develop an open source architecture. I'm excited to announce a Fortune 500 health care customer is teaming with ADI to help upgrade its manufacturing capabilities using more connected robotics, thereby doubling our addressable market.
And in space, we have design wins going to production this year with traditional aerospace companies and new emerging disruptors that enable the proliferation of next-generation communication satellites. These satellites continuously change their position to earth and require space grade phased array and beam forming technology to create an uninterrupted connection. And we're using this strong position in RF to attach power technologies, thereby increasing our addressable market by 1/3.
ADI also remains committed to strong shareholder returns. This quarter, we returned approximately $230 million through dividends. Recall that we paused share buybacks due to the pandemic. This has helped us further solidify our balance sheet with a cash balance of more than $1 billion.
At this point, I'd be remiss to not discuss our M&A strategy in the light of the Maxim acquisition. ADI selectively uses M&A to expand both our scale and our scope in order to better address the future needs of our customers and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And while cost synergies are an important element in evaluating any acquisition, from our perspective, the most compelling benefits come from combining technology portfolios to capture new addressable markets and drive on term revenue synergies. This revenue takes time to realize, given the nature of the Analog business, but our products deliver recurring revenue streams and cash flow for decades. Therefore, we strive to achieve our return objective within approximately 5 years. This time frame allows us to not only achieve the stated cost savings but also begin to capture the early revenue synergies. And I think the acquisition of LTC illustrates the benefits of our strategy.
Our top priorities there were harmonizing the 2 organizations to create an entity that is better than the sum of its parts. To that end, I'm proud to say that we've retained and invested in LTC's exceptional engineering talent. Together, we've created an exciting road map of high-performance analog and power solutions combined. We're exceeding our original $150 million cost synergy target, and we're on track to realize the next $100 million exiting fiscal '21.
And from a revenue perspective, we've more than doubled our pipeline value, and we have over $500 million of lifetime revenue coming to market this year, increasing our confidence in doubling LTC's historical growth rate. With LTC complete, we pursued the acquisition of Maxim to strengthen our leadership in the analog industry, better positioning ADI to capitalize on secular growth trends.
Over the last 5 years, Maxim has shifted its business strategy to focus on B2B markets while enhancing profitability. As a result, Maxim has increased its B2B revenue mix to approximately 80% of total from 55%, expanded its gross margins by more than 500 basis points and increased its free cash flow margin by over 600 basis points during this period. Combined, we're confident we will continue to improve Maxim's performance. This will be driven by our cadre of engineering talent, complementary technologies and breadth of market applications that I'd like to expand on a little here. The cultures of ADI and Maxim are very aligned. Both companies share a commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. With a combined team of more than 10,000 engineers and $1.5 billion of annual R&D investment, we will continue to be the destination for the world's best analog talent. And with 3x the field technical resources, we'll be better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support.
In the area of power management, Maxim's application-focused offerings are highly complementary with ADI's more general purpose or catalog power portfolio. Together, we will have a more comprehensive power portfolio with approximately $2 billion of revenue. This is particularly important as power is the largest and fastest-growing Analog subsegment and with increasing design complexity and the need for better efficiency, the system power challenges that our customers must overcome continue to rise and rise.
In automotive, Maxim has one of the premier franchisees, increasing revenue at a mid-teens rate over the last 5 years. They're a leader in high-speed data connectivity for cameras, radars and processors with serial link technology while ADI is a leader in audio solutions with our A2B platform, and both companies are well positioned in vehicle electrification, enabling us to better address automakers' EV requirements, which continuously evolve. Together, we will capture more of the increasing system content per vehicle and enable a better experience for the consumer.
Taking a step back, the combined company will have unique positioning with 85% exposure to highly profitable long life B2B markets. Maxim's strengths in the automotive and data center markets will complement ADI's strengths across the industrial, communications and digital health care markets. Additionally, the combined company will have increased financial strength. We expect the combination to be accretive to adjusted EPS within 18 months post close, with targeted cost synergies of $275 million by the end of the second year. We also expect to maintain an industry-leading financial profile. As always, we are committed to generating robust free cash flow, and our goal is to reach the high end of our margin range of 40%.
With our lower leverage ratio at close, we'll also have the opportunity to deliver enhanced cash returns to our shareholders. And I believe that together, we can grow revenue at mid-single digits due to our alignment with important secular growth trends, such as Industry 4.0, digital health care, next-generation communication systems and vehicle electrification as examples.
So in closing, we're seeing promising evidence that a broad-based recovery is underway. However, we recognize that the recovery is highly dependent on the future impacts of the pandemic. We've used this unprecedented time to better align our organization and investments into the most important areas. We believe we'll emerge stronger and are better positioned to drive profitable growth. And as I've shared today, we're very excited about the combination with Maxim, which will drive the next wave of disruptive innovation and deliver significant benefits for all stakeholders.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Prashanth to go through the financial details and outlook."

As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.When we",1266,"Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, my comments, with the exception of revenue and nonop expenses will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
When we provided quarterly guidance in May, we were facing tremendous uncertainty, just returning to normal capacity levels and experiencing volatile demand patterns across end markets. As we progressed through the quarter, we saw stronger-than-anticipated demand that resulted in less cancellations and higher-than-anticipated backlog conversion. With that as context, our results came in above the midpoint of our revised outlook, with revenue of $1.46 billion, operating margins over 42% and EPS of $1.36.
Let me start now with the end market color. Our B2B revenue was up 11% sequentially and flat year-over-year as strength across industrial and communications offset a sharp decline in automotive. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue during the quarter, finished up 3% year-over-year. We experienced robust growth in health care, instrumentation test and energy applications. This strength was moderated by weaker trends across our broad market and automation businesses. Communications, which accounted for 25% of revenue, achieved a record quarter. Revenue finished up 14% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases across both wireless and wireline. This strength came from our leadership position in 5G wireless systems and our solid position in optical connectivity used in carrier networks and data centers.
Automotive, which represented 11% of revenue, decreased 29% year-over-year, with all applications declining due to global factory shutdowns and lower vehicle sales. And while no business is immune to the current environment, our BMS and A2B solutions fared quite well. BMS revenue increased sequentially and was down just modestly year-over-year due to our strong penetration across the ecosystem and increasing consumer preference for electric vehicles. And given the continued adoption of our A2B audio platform, A2B revenue has increased over 70% year-to-date despite lower vehicle sales.
Consumer, which also represented 11% of revenue, was down 13% year-over-year. Relatively flat portable revenue was more than offset by double-digit declines in prosumer due to the pandemic-related softness. We continue to expect 2020 to be the bottom for our consumer business.
In addition to the end market commentary, we wanted to provide some insight by geography as we believe it is helpful to investors in this current climate. Most geographies declined year-over-year. We saw double-digit declines in Europe and Japan, while the decline in North America was less pronounced. The rest of Asia increased and China increased double digits year-over-year, largely driven by the robust growth in communications, given our solid position as well as strength in industrial.
Now moving on to the P&L. Gross margins returned to our model at approximately 70%, down modestly year-over-year from lower fab utilization. We've accelerated the planned LTC factory closings and have started to realize these benefits in the third quarter. We expect additional savings in the fourth quarter, and we'll exit fiscal 2020 with nearly half of the $100 million savings in our run rate.
OpEx was $402 million, up 3% sequentially, yet down 8% year-over-year. We maintained a focus on controlling expenses, which included a 1-week global shutdown during the quarter. OP margins finished at 42.3%, the highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Nonop expenses were $46 million, down $3 million sequentially and more than $10 million year-over-year, driven by lower levels of debt and lower interest rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 11.5%, and all told, third quarter EPS came in at $1.36.
Now moving on to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of cash and about $5.6 billion in total debt. This resulted in a leverage ratio of 1.8x on a trailing 12-month basis. Inventory dollars increased $22 million sequentially, but declined year-over-year. Days of inventory remained basically unchanged at 125. Channel inventory remains lean and is below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target range. Cash from operations was $557 million, and CapEx was only $21 million as we proactively reduced CapEx spend in the current environment. This resulted in free cash flow of $536 million, up 8% year-over-year.
Our long-term CapEx target remains the same at approximately 4% of sales. And as Vince mentioned, on a trailing 12, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Over the same period, we've returned around $860 million to shareholders via dividends and additional $410 million via buybacks. This equates to a free cash flow return after debt reduction of nearly 80%, which is below our 100% return target as we paused our buyback program. 
Now I'd like to expand on Vince's commentary and discuss how our combination with Maxim will further enhance our financial profile. At deal announcement, ADI and Maxim had a combined pro forma leverage ratio of 1.2x, which will decrease between today and deal close. The main driver being Maxim, which is in cash accumulation phase. They will pay one more quarterly dividend before suspending it for 4 quarters, and their buyback is on pause. Said another way, all the cash generation for the 12 months beginning in the second quarter of their fiscal 2021 will be added to the balance sheet. And for reference, over a trailing 12-month period, Maxim generated $730 million of free cash flow. ADI plans to continue to pay and grow our dividend. And as I mentioned earlier, our buyback program was paused during the height of COVID-19 and will remain on hold for now. When circumstances permit, our intention is to reinstate the program, which has nearly $2 billion remaining under authorization.
Also, as we previously outlined, we plan on repaying $300 million to $500 million of debt in 2020. This quarter, we intend to honor that commitment by retiring our $450 million January 2021 note. This will save $13 million of annual interest expense. We believe the stronger balance sheet provides us with flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
And now on to the fourth quarter outlook. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $1.44 billion, plus or minus $70 million. This outlook considers our current understanding of the impact related to the recent legislation enacted on Monday. It's important to remember that this customer's revenue has been significantly reduced over the last year to a low single-digit percent of total sales. We anticipate B2B revenue to decrease modestly for the third quarter. Strong growth in automotive as well as growth in industrial is more than offset by a decline in communications. This decline in communications is related to a slowdown of deployment as we forecasted in the last call and the limited impact from the recent legislation.
On a year-over-year basis, B2B revenue is forecasted to increase low to mid-single digits. We anticipate our operating margin to be approximately 42%, plus or minus 100 bps. We're planning for the tax rate to be between 12% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.32, plus or minus $0.10.
So now I'll close my remarks by stating that third quarter proved better than our expectations, largely driven by our conservative planning and aggressive execution. As we move through the integration planning process with Maxim, we remain fully committed to driving sustainable growth through cutting-edge innovation and a focus on our customer success.
I'm going to pass it back to Mike now to start our Q&A."

So at this point in time, the largest 5G customer there in China that used to be is no longer part of the planning or the -- either in the short term or the long term. I'd say as well what we've seen in terms of the strength in China that Prashanth referred to is really -- is the fact that China was the first to go into the pandemic. First to come out. It's an economy that's growing very, very rapidly and has been up for several years now. So I think there's been a very good balance, I believe, between supply and demand across all the sectors. I mean we've seen growth in all markets with the exception of automotive. So I think what we're seeing in terms of the strength in China is more about the match between the strength in our business and the economy than anything else."

We don't give forward guidance on an end market basis by quarter anymore. We haven't done that for a little bit of time. So we don't want to start that now.

And if you look at 4G, specifically, just to give you a bit of perspective here, we grew, albeit a very, very lumpy business, as we always say, but we grew over the entire era of its build out by mid-single digits. We had more content than we had in the prior generations. We took more share. And we're actually even better positioned in 5G because it's a more complex radio problem fundamentally. We have a lot more technology to put into the space from microwave and RF, right down to the mixed signal. And now we're attaching power also. So another factor that we're beginning to see the emergence of. So today, 5G has really been about giving more bandwidth to the consumer, more throughput to the consumer. The future is about, I think, B2B more so than the consumer. And we're beginning to see, I believe, the early adoption of 5G in the factory automation area. In fact, I have verified that with some of our industrial automation customers as well. So 3Q is definitely likely the highest revenue quarter this year, but there are lots of drivers at the secular level and the company level to keep us in good stead for growth over the long term."

This quarter, as we look forward to our guide, we've got stronger coverage from backlog than we typically do. And if we converted -- if you recall, in the third quarter, we said that we had about $50 million of products that we couldn't ship in the second quarter that we caught up with in the third quarter. That actually came in a little bit higher because we had fewer cancellations. So we probably had maybe $100 million all in of revenue in third quarter that really related to backlog from second quarter. So I think that through fourth quarter, we're going to get supply and demand back in balance. Backlog has come down and will be more back to normal levels. As we have guided for the fourth quarter, we've taken into consideration the stronger backlog, but we've also taken into consideration that at an ADI level, our book-to-bill for the fourth quarter is now below parity."

This is a question I get a lot and I scratch my head on this too because of you bought Linear and then Maxim also on the power side. So the question -- and you did provide us with some details on Linear. A couple of questions tied to that. With respect to Hittite, you have given us the growth in Hittite versus what it used to grow and how you have been able to grow that versus prior to acquisition. So the question is, how has Linear done with respect to the core business? And I don't expect you to answer it every quarter, but I think it's a pertinent question in light of the Maxim acquisition. So kind of 2-part question. One, how has Linear done since you bought it?
And then this was the year that we were supposed to get revenue synergy. Now this is a very topsy-turvy year, so we all understand that. But should we expect revenue synergies to start showing up from Linear with all the efforts that have been going on?"

I would say, at this point in time, we've put more than 100 basis points of growth on the base Linear growth rate to date. We have -- I think the greatest indicator for what things are likely to be in the future, I've said before that I believe that we can double the growth rate of LT over the longer term, and just given the markets in which we play and the design cycles, the product cycles, it takes 3 years minimum, and then you begin to see the real benefits, I think, after 5 years. So we're over 100 basis points of additive growth right now.
And if you look at our pipeline, I referred to it in the prepared remarks, we have got a design win pipeline of over $0.5 billion thus far. We have seen wins in communications, both on the wireless side as well as the data center side. Infotainment in automotive, infotainment, radar and, of course, BMS. We're seeing tremendous uptake for some of our more integrated products in areas like instrumentation tests using our micromodule technologies. And I'm quite pleased, given the turmoil in the global markets right now that we continue to see good traction on the design win rates, and I'm confident that we can get from 3% to 4% growth rates in the past to more -- a higher -- mid- to high single-digit level in the future and do it sustainably. So I think we have emerging evidence that we're on good track to do that."

Actually, our book-to-bill was greater than unity across all regions over the last month or so. And we believe that our third quarter represents the bottom of the cycle for us. So I think the near-term recovery and the demand that we're seeing relates to factories coming back online and also a slow improvement in SAAR. So I think the shape of the recovery really depends on the demand -- the end demand for cars and how SAAR actually grows. And we'll -- that will need -- we'll need to see continued vehicle demand to get back to the pre-COVID level. So it's not there yet. So factories are coming back online. Demand is slowly increasing. So hard to call the exact shape, but somewhere between a V and a U, I guess, or maybe already a U, and we're seeing the upsurge.
I would say electric vehicles in general have held up better in this market. As we said in the prepared remarks, there's a strong consumer preference for electric vehicles. It's the fastest-growing sector at this point in time. And we're continuing to gain share in the market. We've seen growth quarter-on-quarter in that space. And we're also very pleased with our performance. A2B actually grew about, I think it was 70% year-to-date. So the adoption, the design wins that we had gotten last year across most of the OEMs beginning to turn into serious revenue now. And on top of that, we're also overlaying this road noise cancellation technology that uses our digital signal processors, algorithmic technology and different analog support technologies on the input and output there. So those are the major areas. And I think, as I said, I believe we're in a slow recovery phase in automotive. And I think, in general, very hard to call the next quarter, the next 2 quarters, but my sense is '21 will be a growth year for the industry and a growth year for ADI. And -- I mean that's how I viewed at this point in time. So we're seeing a gentle recovery in general across all our market spaces."

And I would also say that we -- when we look back at the demand activity over the last quarter or 2, we feel very good that, that was driven by very kind of real demand based on conversations with customers. But there was probably some level of inventory building that was going on in there given that the inventory levels at our end customers were so low. Coming into this pandemic, they had taken -- end customers really at the industrial level, had taken their inventory levels down pretty significantly in 2019. And then the pandemic hit. And so I think some of the strength that the industry is seeing now has a little bit of that renormalizing that. So as we kind of look forward into fourth quarter, there is a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that the new order activity remains good, overdues are declining. So it's -- I think we'll have to let another quarter or 2 roll out. We don't have enough visibility, I think, to tell you what the future portends.

The biggest portion of our aerospace and defense business is defense, and that business is holding up well as well as the space business, which continues to grow nicely.

Fortunately, ADI was already",1537,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.
So 2020 represented a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target our durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively. Levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy level of investment against any economic backdrop.
We've also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trends, such as digital health care. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio, and I'll expand on this in a while.
As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our  to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first corporate responsibility report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19.
We prioritize production of our health care solutions to support customers, and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities as we've made multimillion-dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market.
Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion, down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020. While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. 
So now I'd like to provide an update on how we're shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments, and we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim.
The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will join forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog-mixed signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And a 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent.
We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares, and Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021.
Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering as we continue to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its own parallel breadth and depth from DC 100 gigahertz from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance.
Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. But what's just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted, integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management.
To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging, focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends.
Now look across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with Industrial. This is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transitions to Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision signal processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robot and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave RF and 5G is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0.
In health care, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home to support this. Systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bringing to market hundreds of new products and touting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last 5 years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate, even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing, computing and close to help enable the secular shift to health care from anywhere.
In Communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology, that enables carriers to scale and upgrade their networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets. And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth.
To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants, such as Intel and Marvell, and this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile.
The automotive market is undergoing a revolution with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire OTM battery line. Since the launch just a few months ago, interacting this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem.
Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensified. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest Fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle.
We've also identified opportunities to attach our OTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we're creating deeper customer relationship, while increasing our SAM per audio system.
Turning to consumer now. This is a market that has had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multiyear growth trajectory.
So in closing, this is clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum, and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets, and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30 years-plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I am today.
And so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."

As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year. And our revenue was up 14% in the second half compared to the first.
Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. OP margins landed at 40% as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $4.91.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high end of our outlook driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive.
And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications. Notably, automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial grew for the first time in 2 years. For the year, Industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business.
In the fourth quarter, Communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, Communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by entity list restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center.
In the fourth quarter, Automotive, which represented 15% of revenue was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production.
And finally, in the fourth quarter, Consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, yet down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after 3 years of declines.
Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. OP margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-OP expense was $44 million down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44.
If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our 7- to 8-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21.
In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion.
During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis.
Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last 3 years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return, and increase shareholder value over the long term, through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high teens year-over-year.
OP margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10.
I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. regarding our merger, followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders. We also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress, and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination. And together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A."

Vince, my question is on the demand environment, both the near-term and what you sense for the next calendar year? So in the near term, which end markets do you feel are back to normal levels which are below trend line? Because when I look at your January outlook, up 15%-or-so year-on-year, obviously, against some easier comps. You're certainly starting the year on a very strong note. But just how should we think about the overall year in terms of the puts and takes for the different end markets, Industrial, Auto, Comms and Consumer? Any broad color, just near-term and for calendar '21, I think it'd be really helpful to help kind of frame our models for your forecast?"
251411,693454870,2152739,"Analog Devices, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 24, 2020",2020-11-24,"Earnings Calls","Analog Devices, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Thanks for your question, Vivek.

Thanks for your question, Vivek. I would say, clearly, as you said, overall demand is better. And I think as well, there's a very good balance between supply and demand inventories are, I'd say, very, very well balanced that our customers as best we can tell. Right now, we're seeing very strong trends in Automotive and Industrial. While we expected, comms is a little softer after a big first half of 2010. But overall, I believe 2021, I think, I said in the last call, is going to be a solid growth year for ADI and for the industry. And my conviction has become even stronger since the last earnings call here.
Let me try and unpack things a little for you, if I go through a couple of the market segments. Industrial, we've clearly seen a broadening of demand. And if you look at 2020, the first half, clearly about health care, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas. And that strength has persisted in persistent the second half of the year. And I think the second half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation. They're more horizontal businesses for ADI. So we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond.
Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well. And the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the subsegments within to give you a little bit of color. Electrification is strong. So our BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions are doing particularly well. And our Infotainment business, which is -- which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years, really. And you will have seen no doubt as well the active road noise cancellation solutions that we're adding again on top of that platform.
So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here. So 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020.
So I think '21 will be about deployment of 5G, which is a very good part of our communication story. I expect it will move more global, beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad we have a report as well. Consumer has been on the downward radiate for several years, but we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek."

Maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer to the last question there, comms, in general, for us have seen strength in both wireless and wire technologies, optical wired, particularly in the wired area. And what we're seeing is obviously more aggressive deployments of these massive MIMO based systems, where our channel count continues to increase, which gives ADI a lot more content for radio. And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger, given the investments we've been making up for several years, and our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs are more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying.
So I think it's important to remember, 5G is at the early stages of multi year, probably decade run here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployment of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver, probably towards the second half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also -- we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with -- partners in that area. You will have seen also, the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies, our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan to our partnership with NEC. So I think it's classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next 3 years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like health care, factory automation and so on and so forth.
So I think if you look over the long term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for AEI. We have more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers. And we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply -- to deal with the complexity that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems."

So let me let me handle that in 2 pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from Automotive and so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in Automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins.
As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter for the first quarter, we're passing through the holiday period, so we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses, and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the 2 LTC facilities in the balance of 2021.
On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber as a flywheel. So in 2020, when we had the great deal of uncertainty that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020, and we brought that back into place this past quarter. So you'll see headwinds from both of those decisions into the first quarter. And I mentioned that in my guide, so it's both in my prepared remarks, it's both a full quarter of merit and better variable compensation."

Yes, first and foremost, it's been a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP, but we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First half of the year for ADI was about Aerospace and Defense, health care and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So -- and that's continued, by the way, through the second half. And then we're building upon that in the -- with the upsurge, the second half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, began to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue, by the way, albeit I'll say somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes root, I believe, in 2021.
So -- and also this business for ADI, Industrial owns more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus, a decade ago, we decided this was really the root of the company, and we're beginning to really see demonstrated in our results versus our competition, and we're gaining market share. I think that's important too. So we cover more customers. We have more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, health care moving towards digitalization, telemedicine. These all bode really well for ADI for the long term.
And where does Maxim add value to us? Well, Industrial actually is really about -- it's primarily about precision signal processing and power management, and Maxim brings very a long heritage in those 2 areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to -- the raw signaled that the sensing, the signal capture, single processing, connectivity and that bodes very well for ADI. So I'm excited about getting more capability to bring to more customers as they require ADI to sell bigger swaps of problems for them. The complexity is growing in terms of their needs.
The analog skill is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So we'll bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish."

So Automotive is a big, big consumer of sophisticated factory automation systems. So that's all improving.
If I think about the long-term prospects for the business, given the vectors, the market vectors, the technology vectors that we've got, my sense is, if you think over the longer-term here, integrate the demand over 3-, 5-year period, my sense is this business can grow in the mid- to high single-digit level for ADI."

So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the Auto market at large, and our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have. And the share performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the single processing. So I think that -- just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area. I think that's a growth trend for decade, 1.5 decades, 2 decades. So we feel good about that given our position.
I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high-performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology, road noise cancellation, A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So we've been talking about it a long time, but now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area.
If I look at 1Q, typically, that the Automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond.
But, if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last 3 years or so. I've talked already about the electric vehicle markets. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery disposal. So we're growing share in those key markets, and we continue to innovate in this space and create more blue span between ourselves and our competition. As the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So we brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the Automotive sector.
I've talked about already, A2B, road noise cancellation, and we managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressed 
The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise the Automotive, the critical applications in which we play. And that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that in areas like safety, the radar as well as vision-based safety systems. And just in the car, in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design ins. Now we're turning them to revenue."

I think Vince did a good job talking about how it's not just about China. The good thing as you move to '21 is more global, 5G. North America should start taking off. Europe, Japan, Korea is really starting to broaden out and less about China. China is still will be the biggest market, but really global 5G deployment should do better year-on-year in '21."

So 2020 represented a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target more durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively, levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy level of investment against any economic backdrop.
We've also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trend such as digital health care. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio, and I'll expand on this in a while.
As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our expertise to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first corporate responsibility report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19.
We prioritize production of our health care solutions to support customers, and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities, as we've made multimillion dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts.
Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market.
Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion,                 down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020.
While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500.
So now I'd like to provide an update on how we're shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments, and we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim.
The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will joint forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog, mixed signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent.
We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares, and Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021.
Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering as we continue to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its own parallel breadth and depth from DC 100 gigahertz from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance.
Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. But what's just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management.
To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are merging focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends.
Now looking across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with industrial. This is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transition to Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision signal processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robot and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave RF and 5G is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0.
In health care, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home to support this. Systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bringing to market hundreds of new products and tilting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last 5 years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate, even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing,                                                computing and cloud to help enable the secular shift to health care from anywhere.
In communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology, that enables carriers to scale and upgrade our networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets.
And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth.
To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants, such as Intel and Marvell, and this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced a collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile.
The automotive market is undergoing a revolution with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution, while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire Ultium battery line. Since the launch just a few months ago, interest in this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem.
Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensified. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle.
We've also identified opportunities to attach our LTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we're creating deeper customer relationship, while increasing our SAM per audio system.
Turning to consumer now. This is a market that has had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multiyear growth trajectory.
So in closing, this is clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum, and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets, and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30 years-plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I am today.
And so with that, I'm going to turn over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."

Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year. And our revenue was up 14% in the second half compared to the first.
Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. Op margins landed at 40% as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $4.91.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high end of our outlook driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive.
And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications. Notably, automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial grew for the first time in 2 years. For the year, industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business.
In the fourth quarter, communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by entity list restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center.
In the fourth quarter, automotive, which represented 15% of revenue was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production.
And finally, in the fourth quarter, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, yet down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after 3 years of declines.
Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. Op margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million, down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44.
If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our 7- to 8-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21.
In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion.
During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis.
Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last 3 years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term, through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high teens year-over-year.
Op margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint, down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10.
I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. regarding our merger, followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders. We also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress, and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination. And together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A."

Vince, my question is on the demand environment, both near-term and what you sense for the next calendar year? So in the near term, which end markets do you feel are back to normal levels, which are below trend line? Because when I look at your January outlook, up 15%-or-so year-on-year, obviously, against some easier comps. You're certainly starting the year on a very strong note. But just how should we think about the overall year in terms of the puts and takes for the different end markets, industrial, auto, comms and consumer?

And I think as well, there's a very good balance between supply and demand. Inventories are, I'd say, very, very well balanced at our customers as best we can tell. Right now, we're seeing very strong trends in automotive and industrial. While we expected, comms is a little softer after a big first half of 2020. But overall, I believe 2021, I think, I said in the last call, is going to be a solid growth year for ADI and for the industry. And my conviction has become even stronger since the last earnings call here.
Let me try and unpack things a little for you, if I go through a couple of the market segments. Industrial, we've clearly seen a broadening of demand. And if you look at 2020, the first half, clearly about health care, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas. And that strength has persisted -- persisted in the second half of the year. And I think the second half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation. They're more horizontal businesses for ADI. So we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond.
Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well. And the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the subsegments within to give you a little bit of color. Electrification is strong. So are BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions are doing particularly well. And our infotainment business, which is -- which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years, really. And you will have seen no doubt as well the active road noise cancellation solutions that we're adding again on top of that platform.
So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here. So 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020.
So I think '21 will be about deployment of 5G, which is a big, big part of our communication story. I expect it will move more global, beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad to be able to report as well consumer has been on the downward [ trend ] for several years, but we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek."

And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger, given the investments we've been making up for several years, and our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs are more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying.
So I think it's important to remember, 5G is at the early stages of multiyear, probably decade run here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployment of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver, probably towards the second half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also -- we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with ecosystem partners in that area. You will have seen also the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies, our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan to our partnership with NEC. So I think classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next 3 years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like health care, factory automation and so on and so forth.
So I think if you look over the long term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for ADI. We have more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers. And we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply -- to deal with the complexity that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems."

So let me -- let me handle that in 2 pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from automotive and so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins.
As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter, for the first quarter, we're passing through the holiday period, so we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our -- some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses, and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the 2 LTC facilities in the balance of 2021.
On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber as a flywheel. So in 2020, when we had the great deal of uncertainty that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020, and we brought that back into place this past quarter. So you'll see headwinds from those -- from both of those decisions into the first quarter. And I mentioned that in my guide, so it's both -- in my prepared remarks, it's both a full quarter of merit and better variable compensation."

Yes, first and foremost, it's been a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP, but we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First half of the year for ADI was about aerospace and defense, health care and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So -- and that's continued, by the way, through the second half. And then we're building upon that in the -- with the upsurge, the second half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, began to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue, by the way, albeit I'll say somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes root, I believe, in 2021.
So -- and also this business for ADI, industrial owns more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus, a decade ago, we decided this was really the root of the company, and we're beginning to really see demonstrated in our results versus our competition, and we're gaining market share. I think that's important too. So we cover more customers. We have more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, health care moving towards digitalization, telemedicine, these all bode really well for ADI for the long term.
And where does Maxim add value to us? Well, industrial actually is really about -- it's primarily about precision signal processing and power management, and Maxim brings very a long heritage in those 2 areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to cloud, the raw signal -- the sensing, the signal capture, signal processing, connectivity and that bodes very well for ADI. So I'm excited about getting more capability to bring to more customers as they require ADI to sell bigger [ swaps ] of problems for them. The complexity is growing in terms of their needs.
The analog skill is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So we'll bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish."

So automotive is a big, big consumer of sophisticated factory automation system. So that's all improving.
If I think about the long-term prospects for the business, given the vectors, the market vectors, the technology vectors that we've got, my sense is, if you think over the longer-term here, integrate the demand over 3-, 5-year period, my sense is this business can grow in the mid- to high single-digit level for ADI."

So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the auto market at large, and our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have. And the share performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the sensing, the signal processing. So I think that -- just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area, I think that's a growth trend for decade, 1.5 decades, 2 decades. So we feel good about that given our position.
I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high-performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology, road noise cancellation, A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So we've been talking about it a long time, but now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area.
If I look at 1Q, typically, the automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond.
And if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about, that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last 3 years or so. I've talked already about the electric vehicle markets. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery disposal. So we're growing share in those key markets, and we continue to innovate in this space and create more [indiscernible] between ourselves and our competition, as the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So we brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with GM on. But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the automotive sector.
I've talked about infotainment already, A2B, road noise cancellation, and we managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressed SAR.
The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise, the automotive, the critical applications in which we play. And that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that in areas like safety, the radar as well as vision-based safety systems. And just in the car, in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design-ins. Now we're turning them to revenue."

Fortunately, ADI was already",1539,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. I hope that you and your families are healthy and safe at this time.
So 2020 represented a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target more durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively, levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy level of investment against any economic backdrop.
We've also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trend such as digital health care. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio, and I'll expand on this in a while.
As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our expertise to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first corporate responsibility report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19.
We prioritize production of our health care solutions to support customers, and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities, as we've made multimillion dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts.
Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market.
Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion, down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020.
While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500.
So now I'd like to provide an update on how we're shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments, and we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim.
The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will join forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog, mixed signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And at 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent.
We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares, and Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021.
Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering as we continue to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its unparalleled breadth and depth from DC 100 gigahertz from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance.
Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. With watts just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management.
To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends.
Now looking across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with industrial. This is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transition to Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision fixed processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robot and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave RF and 5G is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0.
In health care, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home to support this. Systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bringing to market hundreds of new products and tilting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last 5 years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate, even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing,                                                computing and cloud to help enable the secular shift to health care from anywhere.
In communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology, that enables carriers to scale and upgrade their networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets.
And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth.
To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants, such as Intel and Marvell, and this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced the collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile.
The automotive market is undergoing a revolution with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution, while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire Ultium battery line. Since the launch just a few months ago, interest in this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem.
Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensified. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle.
We've also identified opportunities to attach our LTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we're creating deeper customer relationship, while increasing our SAM per audio system.
Turning to consumer now. This is a market that has had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multiyear growth trajectory.
So in closing, this is clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum, and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets, and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30 years-plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I am today.
And so with that, I'm going to turn over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."

Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items o",1023,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year. And our revenue was up 14% in the second half compared to the first.
Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. Op margins landed at 40% as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $4.91.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high end of our outlook driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive.
And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications. Notably, automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial grew for the first time in 2 years. For the year, industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business.
In the fourth quarter, communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by entity list restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center.
In the fourth quarter, automotive, which represented 15% of revenue was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production.
And finally, in the fourth quarter, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, yet down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after 3 years of declines.
Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. Op margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million, down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44.
If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our 7- to 8-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21.
In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion.
During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis.
Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last 3 years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term, through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high teens year-over-year.
Op margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint, down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10.
I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. regarding our merger, followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders. We also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress, and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination. And together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A."

Vince, my question is on the demand environment, both near-term and what you sense for the next calendar year? So in the near term, which end markets do you feel are back to normal levels, which are below trend line? Because when I look at your January outlook, up 15%-or-so year-on-year, obviously, against some easier comps. You're certainly starting the year on a very strong note. But just how should we think about the overall year in terms of the puts and takes for the different end markets, industrial, auto, comms and consumer? Any broad color, just near-term and for calendar '21? I think it'd be really helpful to help kind of frame our models for your forecast."

And I think as well, there's a very good balance between supply and demand. Inventories are, I'd say, very, very well balanced at our customers as best we can tell. Right now, we're seeing very strong trends in automotive and industrial while we expected comms is a little softer after a big first half of 2020. But overall, I believe 2021, I think, I said in the last call, is going to be a solid growth year for ADI and for the industry. And my conviction has become even stronger since the last earnings call here.
Let me try and unpack things a little for you, if I go through a couple of the market segments. Industrial, we've clearly seen a broadening of demand. And if you look at 2020, the first half, clearly about health care, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas. And that strength has persisted -- persisted in the second half of the year. And I think the second half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation. They're more horizontal businesses for ADI. So we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond.
Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well. And the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the subsegments within to give you a little bit of color, electrification is strong. So are BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions are doing particularly well. And our infotainment business, which is -- which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years, really. And you will have seen no doubt as well the active road noise cancellation solutions that we're adding again on top of that platform.
So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here. So 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020.
So I think '21 will be about deployment of 5G, which is a big, big part of our communication story. I expect it will move more global, beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad to be able to report as well consumer has been on the downward for ADI
 for several years, but we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek."

So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer t",379,"Yes. So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer to the last question there, comms, in general, for us have seen strength in both wireless and wired technologies, optical wired, particularly in the wired area. And what we're seeing is obviously more aggressive deployments of these massive MIMO-based systems, where our channel count continues to increase, which gives ADI a lot more content per radio. And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger, given the investments we've been making up for several years, and our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs or more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying.
So I think it's important to remember, 5G is at the early stages of multiyear, probably decade ramp here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployment of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver, probably towards the second half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also -- we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with [ ecosystem ] partners in that area. You will have seen also the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies, our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan through our partnership with NEC. So I think classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next 3 years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like health care, factory automation and so on and so forth.
So I think if you look over the long term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for ADI. We have more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers. And we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply -- to deal with the complexity that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems."

So let me -- let me handle that in 2 pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from automotive and so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins.
As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter, for the first quarter, we're passing through the holiday period, so we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our -- some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses, and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the 2 LTC facilities in the balance of 2021.
On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber as a flywheel. So in 2020, when we had the great deal of uncertainty that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020, and we brought that back into place this past quarter. So you'll see headwinds from those -- from both of those decisions into the first quarter. And I mentioned that in my guide, so it's both -- in my prepared remarks, it's both a full quarter of merit and better variable compensation."

Yes, first and foremost, it's still a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP, but we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First half of the year for ADI was about aerospace and defense, health care and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So -- and that's continued, by the way, through the second half. And then we're building upon that in the -- with the upsurge, the second half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, we’re going to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue, by the way, albeit off a somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes root, I believe, in 2021.
So -- and also this business for ADI, industrial owns more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus, a decade ago, we decided this was really the root of the company, and we're beginning to really see demonstrated in our results versus our competition, and we're gaining market share. I think that's important too. So we cover more customers. We have more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, health care moving towards digitalization, telemedicine, these all bode really well for ADI for the long term.
And where does Maxim add value to us? Well, industrial actually is really about -- it's primarily about precision signal processing and power management, and Maxim brings very a long heritage in those 2 areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to cloud, the raw signal -- the sensing, the signal capture, signal processing, connectivity and that bodes very well for ADI. So I'm excited about getting more capability to bring to more customers as they require ADI to solve bigger swaths of problems for them. The complexity is growing in terms of their needs.
The analog skill is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So we'll bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish."

So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the auto market at large, and our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have. And the sheer performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the sensing, the signal processing. So I think that -- just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area, I think that's a growth trend for decade, 1.5 decades, 2 decades. So we feel good about that given our position.
I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high-performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology, road noise cancellation, A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So we've been talking about it a long time, but now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area.
If I look at 1Q, typically, the automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond.
And if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about, that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last 3 years or so. I've talked already about the electric vehicle markets. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery disposal. So we're growing share in those key markets, and we continue to innovate in this space and create more [ blue sky ] between ourselves and our competition, as the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So we brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with GM on. But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the automotive sector.
I've talked about infotainment already, A2B, road noise cancellation, and we managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressed SAAR.
The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise, the automotive, the critical applications in which we play. And that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that. In areas like safety, the radar, those vision-based safety systems and just in the car, in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design-ins. Now we're turning them to revenue."

I think when they do happen, it will be a great business for us, and we'll continue to grow in that market, but it's very hard to call when that market will turn back on, sometime likely in the first half of '21, but really unsure to pinpoint it today when that's going to be, given all the geopolitical tensions out there. I think Vince did a good job talking about how it's not just about China. The good thing as you move to '21 is more global, 5G. North America should start taking off. Europe, Japan, Korea is really starting to broaden out and less about China. China still will be the biggest market, but really global 5G deployment should do better year-on-year in '21."

So 2020 represented a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target more durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively, levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy level of investment against any economic backdrop.
We've also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trend such as digital health care. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio, and I'll expand on this in a while.
As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our expertise to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first corporate responsibility report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19.
We prioritize production of our health care solutions to support customers, and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities, as we've made multimillion dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts.
Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market.
Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion, down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020.
While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500.
So now I'd like to provide an update on how we're shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments, and we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim.
The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will join forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog, mixed signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And at 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent.
We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares and Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021.
Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering as we continue to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its unparalleled breadth and depth from DC 100 gigahertz from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance.
Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. With watts just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management.
To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends.
Now looking across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with industrial. This is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transition to Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision fixed processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robot and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave RF and 5G is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0.
In health care, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home to support this. Systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bringing to market hundreds of new products and tilting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last 5 years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate, even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing,                                                computing and cloud to help enable the secular shift to health care from anywhere.
In communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology, that enables carriers to scale and upgrade their networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets.
And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth.
To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants, such as Intel and Marvell, and this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced the collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile.
The automotive market is undergoing a revolution with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution, while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire Ultium battery line. Since the launch just a few months ago, interest in this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem.
Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensified. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle.
We've also identified opportunities to attach our LTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we're creating deeper customer relationship, while increasing our SAM per audio system.
Turning to consumer now. This is a market that has had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multiyear growth trajectory.
So in closing, this is clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum, and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets, and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30 years-plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I am today.
And so with that, I'm going to turn over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."

Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year. And our revenue was up 14% in the second half compared to the first.
Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. Op margins landed at 40% as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $4.91.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high end of our outlook driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive.
And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications. Notably, automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial grew for the first time in 2 years. For the year, industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business.
In the fourth quarter, communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by entity list restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center.
In the fourth quarter, automotive, which represented 15% of revenue was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production.
And finally, in the fourth quarter, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, yet down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after 3 years of declines.
Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. Op margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million, down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44.
If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our 7- to 8-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21.
In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion.
During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis.
Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last 3 years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term, through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high teens year-over-year.
Op margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint, down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10.
I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. regarding our merger, followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders. We also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress, and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination. And together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A."

And if you look at 2020, the first half, clearly about health care, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas. And that strength has persisted -- persisted in the second half of the year. And I think the second half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation. They're more horizontal businesses for ADI. So we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond.
Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well. And the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the subsegments within to give you a little bit of color, electrification is strong. So are BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions are doing particularly well. And our infotainment business, which is -- which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years, really. And you will have seen no doubt as well the active road noise cancellation solutions that we're adding again on top of that platform.
So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here. So 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020.
So I think '21 will be about deployment of 5G, which is a big, big part of our communication story. I expect it will move more global, beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad to be able to report as well consumer has been on the downward for ADI
 for several years, but we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek."

So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer t",379,"Yes. So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer to the last question there, comms, in general, for us have seen strength in both wireless and wired technologies, optical wired, particularly in the wired area. And what we're seeing is obviously more aggressive deployments of these massive MIMO-based systems, where our channel count continues to increase, which gives ADI a lot more content per radio. And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger, given the investments we've been making up for several years, and our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs or more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying.
So I think it's important to remember, 5G is at the early stages of multiyear, probably decade ramp here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployment of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver, probably towards the second half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also -- we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with [ ecosystem ] partners in that area. You will have seen also the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies, our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan through our partnership with NEC. So I think classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next 3 years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like health care, factory automation and so on and so forth.
So I think if you look over the long term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for ADI. We have more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers. And we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply -- to deal with the complexity that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems."

So let me -- let me handle that in 2 pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from automotive and so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins.
As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter, for the first quarter, we're passing through the holiday period, so we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our -- some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses, and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the 2 LTC facilities in the balance of 2021.
On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber as a flywheel. So in 2020, when we had the great deal of uncertainty that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020, and we brought that back into place this past quarter. So you'll see headwinds from those -- from both of those decisions into the first quarter. And I mentioned that in my guide, so it's both -- in my prepared remarks, it's both a full quarter of merit and better variable compensation."

Yes, first and foremost, it's still a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP, but we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First half of the year for ADI was about aerospace and defense, health care and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So -- and that's continued, by the way, through the second half. And then we're building upon that in the -- with the upsurge, the second half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, we’re going to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue, by the way, albeit off a somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes root, I believe, in 2021.
So -- and also this business for ADI, industrial owns more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus, a decade ago, we decided this was really the root of the company, and we're beginning to really see demonstrated in our results versus our competition, and we're gaining market share. I think that's important too. So we cover more customers. We have more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, health care moving towards digitalization, telemedicine, these all bode really well for ADI for the long term.
And where does Maxim add value to us? Well, industrial actually is really about -- it's primarily about precision signal processing and power management, and Maxim brings very a long heritage in those 2 areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to cloud, the raw signal -- the sensing, the signal capture, signal processing, connectivity and that bodes very well for ADI. So I'm excited about getting more capability to bring to more customers as they require ADI to solve bigger swaths of problems for them. The complexity is growing in terms of their needs.
The analog skill is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So we'll bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish."

So automotive is a big, big consumer of sophisticated factory automation system. So that's all improving.
If I think about the long-term prospects for the business, given the vectors, the market vectors, the technology vectors that we've got, my sense is, if you think over the longer-term here, integrate the demand over 3-, 5-year period, my sense is this business can grow in the mid- to high single-digit level for ADI."

So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the auto market at large, and our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have. And the sheer performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the sensing, the signal processing. So I think that -- just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area, I think that's a growth trend for decade, 1.5 decades, 2 decades. So we feel good about that given our position.
I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high-performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology, road noise cancellation, A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So we've been talking about it a long time, but now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area.
If I look at 1Q, typically, the automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond.
And if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about, that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last 3 years or so. I've talked already about the electric vehicle markets. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery disposal. So we're growing share in those key markets, and we continue to innovate in this space and create more [ blue sky ] between ourselves and our competition, as the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So we brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with GM on. But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the automotive sector.
I've talked about infotainment already, A2B, road noise cancellation, and we managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressed SAAR.
The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise, the automotive, the critical applications in which we play. And that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that. In areas like safety, the radar, those vision-based safety systems and just in the car, in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design-ins. Now we're turning them to revenue."

So 2020 represented a year of strategic progress for ADI in a very highly uncertain macroeconomic environment. Fortunately, ADI was already operating from a position of strength. Over the last decade, we've created a structurally more profitable business. We realigned our portfolio to target more durable end markets and become more diverse across customers, products and applications. During this past year and at the height of the pandemic, this business model proved quite resilient with gross and operating margins troughing at 68% and 37%, respectively, levels we previously considered peak. It's this resiliency that enables us to sustain a healthy level of investment against any economic backdrop.
We've also been not afraid to make strategic pivots towards the most attractive investment opportunities that enhance our customer engagement and better align us to secular growth trend such as digital health care. Clearly, the biggest investment decision of 2020 was our strategic combination with Maxim, which will further extend the scale and scope of our semiconductor portfolio, and I'll expand on this in a while.
As I reflect on the immediate challenges of our current environment, we believe there is more ADI can do to leverage our expertise to engineer a more sustainable future and make an even more positive impact on the world. To that end, earlier this year, we published our first corporate responsibility report and launched the semiconductor industry's first green bond. We also took action in the global fight against COVID-19.
We prioritize production of our health care solutions to support customers, and we're partnering with hospitals and biotech start-ups to develop solutions that leverage our technology. And our impact has extended beyond our own facilities and capabilities, as we've made multimillion dollar donations through the ADI Foundation to support both global and local pandemic response efforts.
Overall, I'm very proud of how we've come together. We embraced and learned from this challenging time and continue to execute at a high level to generate and capture value in the market.
Now turning to our results. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $1.53 billion, and adjusted EPS was $1.44, above the high end of our outlook. For the year, revenue was $5.6 billion, down mid-single digits year-over-year. This was partly driven by the economic volatility and supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic. Despite this, our cumulative B2B revenue outperformed peers for a third consecutive year. We actively managed operating expenses, delivering operating margins of 40% and adjusted EPS of $4.91. We generated approximately $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2020.
While this year's 33% free cash flow margin is just below our long-term financial model, we continue to be in the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500.
So now I'd like to provide an update on how we're shaping ADI to be even more impactful in the future. During the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, with over 95% targeted at the most attractive B2B opportunities. This includes funding new product development to fortify our franchises and drive new vectors of growth. As you know, we selectively use M&A to complement these organic investments, and we've taken a very significant step forward with the pending acquisition of Maxim.
The numerous customers I've spoken with about our combination are delighted that we will join forces. Maxim will strengthen our leadership in the semiconductor industry, creating a more comprehensive analog, mixed signal and power portfolio and further diversifying our business across markets and applications. And at 10,000 engineers strong, the acquisition will solidify ADI as the destination for the world's best analog talent.
We've also been disciplined in our approach to managing our balance sheet. Since we closed the Linear acquisition, we've cut our leverage ratio in half, increased our dividend by 40% and repurchased more than $1 billion of shares and Prashanth will provide further details on our capital allocation outlook for 2021.
Shifting now to customer engagement. Our focus has been unwavering as we continue to solve our customers' toughest challenges. A key strength of ADI is our standard products portfolio. With its unparalleled breadth and depth from DC 100 gigahertz from nanowatts to kilowatts and from sensor to cloud, we define the edge of performance.
Our portfolio is sold across customers of all sizes and provides recurring revenue for decades. With watts just as important, these standard products are the foundation upon which we build more targeted integrated solutions for higher growth vertical applications, such as 5G radio systems and automotive battery management.
To that end, industries are prioritizing digitalization and connectivity more than ever and new industries are emerging focused on the physical and cyber. In many ways, it's semiconductors that are enabling the current virtual economy and ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this evolution and well aligned with key secular growth trends.
Now looking across our segments, I'd like to share some highlights with you. Starting first with industrial. This is an incredibly fragmented market with expanding needs as it transition to Industry 4.0 and beyond. We're in a unique position to not only solve traditional challenges like precision fixed processing, control and power, but also new emerging challenges like connectivity and safety. For example, our time-of-flight solution enables safer factory floors by preventing accidents between humans, robot and cobots. And our connectivity portfolio of deterministic Ethernet, secure microwave RF and 5G is helping our customers to create ubiquitous connectivity, merging their operational and informational technologies to unlock the true value of Industry 4.0.
In health care, the pandemic is accelerating the market towards telemedicine and transitioning care into the home to support this. Systems are being upgraded and clinical-grade patient monitoring is extending outside of the hospital. We doubled our investment ahead of this trend, bringing to market hundreds of new products and tilting our offerings towards complete system solutions. The result, over the last 5 years, we've grown our customer base by over 20% and our revenues at a double-digit rate, even when excluding pandemic-related demand. And we're now increasing our investment in sensing,                                                computing and cloud to help enable the secular shift to health care from anywhere.
In communications, we're the market leader in 5G, a position that will deliver significant growth as 5G broadens globally in 2021 and beyond. At the same time, we view open radio access networks, or O-RAN, as a disruptive technology, that enables carriers to scale and upgrade their networks more quickly and economically, an important step to help proliferate 5G into new markets.
And for ADI's wireless franchise, O-RAN opens up new avenues for growth.
To get ahead of the market, we're further innovating our transceiver and power portfolios to shape the radio of the future. We're also forming strategic partnerships with ecosystem participants, such as Intel and Marvell, and this strategy is working. Last quarter, we announced the collaboration with NEC to enable the first O-RAN installation for Rakuten Mobile.
The automotive market is undergoing a revolution with electric vehicles becoming mainstream. ADI is at the heart of this movement with over half of the top 10 EV brands using our BMS solution. And our new wireless BMS offers the same reliability and performance of our wired solution, while enhancing robustness and configurability. General Motors recently announced that they will deploy our wireless BMS across their entire Ultium battery line. Since the launch just a few months ago, interest in this groundbreaking technology is gaining momentum across the ecosystem.
Looking at automotive more broadly, demand for our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation is intensified. Our innovative solutions are not only the highest fidelity performance technology in the market, but they also reduce weight, removing nearly 100 pounds from an average vehicle.
We've also identified opportunities to attach our LTC portfolio with our A2B platform to deliver both data and power up to 50 watts. By combining all these capabilities, we're creating deeper customer relationship, while increasing our SAM per audio system.
Turning to consumer now. This is a market that has had its fair share of challenges over the last few years for ADI. However, we believe that the business has bottomed in 2020. Recent design wins across a diverse customer base for new and emerging applications like hearables, wearables, high end audio and video solutions put consumer on a multiyear growth trajectory.
So in closing, this is clearly an unprecedented year for us all. We're optimistic that a broad-based recovery is underway, but acknowledge that the recovery remains dependent on the economic impacts of pandemic. With that said, I'm encouraged by our momentum, and we expect 2021 to be a growth year for the company. We've seen an improvement across nearly all of our end markets, and our portfolio is strategically aligned with favorable secular growth trends, a position that gets only stronger with Maxim. In my 30 years-plus at ADI, I've never been more confident about our prospects than I am today.
And so with that, I'm going to turn over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details."

Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items o",1023,"Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our year-end earnings call. As usual, except for revenue and non-op expenses, my comments on the P&L and our outlook will be on a non-GAAP or adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release.
Let me start with a brief recap of 2020. The heightened uncertainty and significant disruption due to the pandemic certainly created a very volatile year. Revenue of $5.6 billion was down 6% year-over-year. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the year. And our revenue was up 14% in the second half compared to the first.
Gross margins finished at 69%, down slightly year-over-year, but we enter 2021 within our long-term financial model. Op margins landed at 40% as we prudently managed our discretionary spend. All told, full year adjusted EPS was $4.91.
Now turning to the fourth quarter. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up 5% sequentially, marking the third consecutive quarter of growth. This exceeded the high end of our outlook driven mainly by stronger-than-anticipated growth in automotive.
And if we look at the individual segments, in the fourth quarter, Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue was up 5% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year. We saw growth across nearly all our major applications. Notably, automation, which makes up approximately 20% of industrial grew for the first time in 2 years. For the year, industrial revenue was about flat, underscoring the diversification across customers and applications in this business.
In the fourth quarter, communications, which represented 20% of revenue, was down 14% sequentially. However, the segment was up 19% year-over-year, driven by double-digit growth in both wireless and wireline. Importantly, our growth was not aided by customer pull-in activity related to geopolitical tensions. And for the year, communications revenue was down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei sales that were impacted in '19 and '20 by entity list restrictions, our revenue grew modestly, a testament to our strong positions in 5G and optical control for carrier networks and data center.
In the fourth quarter, automotive, which represented 15% of revenue was up over 40% sequentially and up modestly year-over-year. While we exit the year with revenue above pre-pandemic levels, it was still down mid-teens for the year due to lower vehicle production.
And finally, in the fourth quarter, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, finished up 12% sequentially, yet down 17% year-over-year. As Vince mentioned, we believe we're positioned to grow in '21 and beyond after 3 years of declines.
Moving on to the rest of the P&L for the fourth quarter, gross margin was 70%, up 160 bps year-over-year. OpEx was $431 million, up 7% sequentially as we reinstated merit and experienced higher variable compensation. Op margins finished at 41.7%, up nearly 300 bps year-over-year. Non-op expense was $44 million, down both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. And our tax rate was lower than usual at approximately 10% and adjusted EPS was $1.44.
If we shift to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventory dollars on our balance sheet declined modestly sequentially and inventory days finished at 121, down from 125 days in the third quarter. Channel inventory fell slightly and remains below our 7- to 8-week target as we saw strong sell-through trends across all geographies. We plan to return to our target inventory model as we progress through '21.
In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $673 million, up 2% year-over-year. Given the pandemic, we continue to be judicious with our CapEx, spending only $30 million this quarter or 2% of revenue. We do anticipate CapEx to normalize to around 4% of revenue for 2021. And for the full year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks or about 80% of free cash flow after debt repayments. This was below our target as we paused our share buyback program at the height of the pandemic and then were restricted following the Maxim announcement. As a result, our cash position increased to over $1 billion.
During the quarter, we used $450 million of our cash flow to retire our 2021 notes. Total debt ended the year at approximately $5.1 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 on a trailing 12-month basis.
Recently, we reinstated our share buyback program, which has $1.9 billion left in authorization or approximately 4% of shares outstanding. Given our low leverage, we do not plan to reduce debt further in '21. For context, over the last 3 years, we've decreased our debt by approximately $3 billion. This stronger balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to improve on our 100% free cash flow return and increase shareholder value over the long term, through a combination of reinvestment in the business, continued dividend increases, greater and more consistent share buybacks and targeted acquisitions.
So now let's look at our first quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $1.5 billion, plus or minus $70 million. At the midpoint of guide, we expect B2B revenue in the aggregate to increase high teens year-over-year.
Op margins are expected to be approximately 40% at the midpoint, down sequentially due to higher variable comp and annual merit. Interest expense is also expected to be down slightly sequentially. For 2021, we anticipate a tax rate between 12% and 14%. And based on these inputs, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.30, plus or minus $0.10.
I'll wrap with a brief update on our pending acquisition of Maxim. In September, we received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. regarding our merger, followed by the overwhelming shareholder support of the combination from both ADI and Maxim shareholders. We also submitted initial applications for regulatory clearance in China and the EU. I'm very encouraged by our progress, and we remain on track to close the acquisition in the summer of 2021. We are excited about this complementary combination. And together, we expect that we will capture additional growth in the years ahead.
So with that, let me turn it back over to Mike to lead the Q&A."

Vince, my question is on the demand environment, both near-term and what you sense for the next calendar year? So in the near term, which end markets do you feel are back to normal levels, which are below trend line? Because when I look at your January outlook, up 15%-or-so year-on-year, obviously, against some easier comps. You're certainly starting the year on a very strong note. But just how should we think about the overall year in terms of the puts and takes for the different end markets, industrial, auto, comms and consumer? Any broad color, just near-term and for calendar '21? I think it'd be really helpful to help kind of frame our models for your forecast."

And I think as well, there's a very good balance between supply and demand. Inventories are, I'd say, very, very well balanced at our customers as best we can tell. Right now, we're seeing very strong trends in automotive and industrial while we expected comms is a little softer after a big first half of 2020. But overall, I believe 2021, I think, I said in the last call, is going to be a solid growth year for ADI and for the industry. And my conviction has become even stronger since the last earnings call here.
Let me try and unpack things a little for you, if I go through a couple of the market segments. Industrial, we've clearly seen a broadening of demand. And if you look at 2020, the first half, clearly about health care, aerospace and defense and automatic test equipment, strength in those areas. And that strength has persisted -- persisted in the second half of the year. And I think the second half actually saw good strength emerge in factory automation, process automation. They're more horizontal businesses for ADI. So we believe that, that strength will continue into the first quarter and beyond.
Automotive, as you will have seen, we had a strong upsurge there as well. And the business, in fact, is now back to pre-COVID levels. And bookings continue to remain strong in that area. And if I look at just the subsegments within to give you a little bit of color, electrification is strong. So are BMS solutions, where we're on the fifth generation of BMS product solutions are doing particularly well. And our infotainment business, which is -- which has emerged beyond high fidelity rendering of audio and video. Our A2B solutions are emerging with great strength, given the pipeline that we've been building over the last several years, really. And you will have seen no doubt as well the active road noise cancellation solutions that we're adding again on top of that platform.
So if I look at maybe comms a little bit here. So 2020 was strong actually across both wireless and wired. Actually, both were up in the fourth quarter of high teens year-over-year. So if we extract Huawei, where we had the restrictions, 2020 was strong across all the rest of the customers. In fact, they grew during 2020.
So I think '21 will be about deployment of 5G, which is a big, big part of our communication story. I expect it will move more global, beyond China, particularly with deployments in North America. And I'm glad to be able to report as well consumer has been on the downward for ADI
 for several years, but we believe now that we've reached the bottom as we had expected in 2020. And given the diversity of applications that we're now addressing, broader-based customers, we feel good about that business in both the portable as well as the more professional solutions that we serve also. So hopefully, that answers your question completely, Vivek."

So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer t",379,"Yes. So if I look at what's happening in the business, maybe I'll take a shorter-term view and a slightly longer-term view and address your question on O-RAN as well, Tore. So what we're seeing is that in the business in general, as I said in the answer to the last question there, comms, in general, for us have seen strength in both wireless and wired technologies, optical wired, particularly in the wired area. And what we're seeing is obviously more aggressive deployments of these massive MIMO-based systems, where our channel count continues to increase, which gives ADI a lot more content per radio. And I would also say that our portfolio has never been stronger, given the investments we've been making up for several years, and our customer share has never been higher with the key OEMs or more balanced in terms of the span of technologies and products that we're supplying.
So I think it's important to remember, 5G is at the early stages of multiyear, probably decade ramp here. And I think 2021 will be characterized by the deployment of 5G more globally beyond China. I expect America to be the primary driver, probably towards the second half of 2021 for 5G. And we've also -- we've seen a lot of interest in our technologies for O-RAN. We're working with [ ecosystem ] partners in that area. You will have seen also the first announcement we've had publicly about the use of our technologies, our radio technologies with Rakuten Mobile in Japan through our partnership with NEC. So I think classical 5G being deployed for consumer applications will continue rapidly over the next 3 years. But I'm also beginning to see now the early stages of adoption of 5G into more deterministically critical applications like health care, factory automation and so on and so forth.
So I think if you look over the long term, Tore, this is going to continue to be a growth market for ADI. We have more content. We've got a stronger position with our customers. And we continue to push the boundaries of technology here to enable our customers to simply -- to deal with the complexity that's increasing exponentially and the more rapid innovation cycles with our software-defined radio systems."

So let me -- let me handle that in 2 pieces. Let's talk gross margins and then OpEx. So for the quarter just passed, 70% gross margins, we had pretty considerable upside from automotive and so we have some mix headwind with that kind of explosive growth in automotive. It's below the corporate average in terms of margins.
As we think about gross margins for the coming quarter, for the first quarter, we're passing through the holiday period, so we're going to have a little bit of continued pressure on utilization, as we have some of our -- some of our fabs will be shut down for the holiday period. But we expect that to improve as the year progresses, and we bring in the remaining $50 million of cost reductions from the shutdown of the 2 LTC facilities in the balance of 2021.
On the OpEx side, you're exactly right. We've designed our variable comp system to really act as a shock absorber as a flywheel. So in 2020, when we had the great deal of uncertainty that operated the way it should and it unwound. In addition, we made a decision as a leadership team to delay implementing merit in 2020, and we brought that back into place this past quarter. So you'll see headwinds from those -- from both of those decisions into the first quarter.

Yes, first and foremost, it's still a fairly tricky time in terms of trying to predict GDP, but we've come out of the year with tremendous strength. First half of the year for ADI was about aerospace and defense, health care and the automatic test equipment sector as well. So -- and that's continued, by the way, through the second half. And then we're building upon that in the -- with the upsurge, the second half is the expansion of growth in factory automation, which is, particularly in the fourth quarter, we’re going to see a very, very good surge, which we expect to continue, by the way, albeit off a somewhat depressed base as economic expansion really takes root, I believe, in 2021.
So -- and also this business for ADI, industrial owns more than half of the company's revenue. The crop of products out there is stronger than it has ever been in the history of the company. Our focus, a decade ago, we decided this was really the root of the company, and we're beginning to really see demonstrated in our results versus our competition, and we're gaining market share. I think that's important too. So we cover more customers. We have more market share, with better product portfolio. So with Industry 4.0 coming on board, health care moving towards digitalization, telemedicine, these all bode really well for ADI for the long term.
And where does Maxim add value to us? Well, industrial actually is really about -- it's primarily about precision signal processing and power management, and Maxim brings very a long heritage in those 2 areas, which we will deploy to even greater effect across the spectrum of sensor to cloud, the raw signal -- the sensing, the signal capture, signal processing, connectivity and that bodes very well for ADI. So I'm excited about getting more capability to bring to more customers as they require ADI to solve bigger swaths of problems for them. The complexity is growing in terms of their needs.
The analog skill is becoming scarcer and scarcer. So we'll bring more of that skill to bear to solve more problems in a more complete way for our customers. So I think that's the way to think about it, Ambrish."

The business is growing 9% year-on-year in October, yet over the last 2 years, essentially flat. And so curious, it sounds like automation growing for the first time in 2 years is a real positive signal. So would kind of love to hear your thoughts on as we come out of this pandemic, what that business segment growth could look like, considering some of the growth vectors that you're investing in like health care as well as perhaps some of the more tried and true machinery typical industrial businesses begin to recover?"

If you look out over the longer term, so industrial automation has been really on its way down for the last 2, 2.5 years. And some of that was driven by the trade tensions.

If you look out over the longer term, so industrial automation has been really on its way down for the last 2, 2.5 years. And some of that was driven by the trade tensions. Obviously, with the automotive sector way off in – I mean SAR was dropping anyway in 2019. The pandemic crushed demand there even more so in 2020. So automotive is a big, big consumer of sophisticated factory automation system. So that's all improving.
If I think about the long-term prospects for the business, given the vectors, the market vectors, the technology vectors that we've got, my sense is, if you think over the longer-term here, integrate the demand over 3-, 5-year period, my sense is this business can grow in the mid- to high single-digit level for ADI."

Just as sort of a clarification on Q4, you guys grew 40% plus sequentially. I think you were guiding that business to be up in the low teens. So obviously, a very big beat in the quarter. Was that essentially a function of higher volume across your customers? And therefore, a beat across most of your customers and most of your applications? Or were there any specific standouts in the quarter? And I guess, more importantly, into fiscal year '21, when you think about your automotive business and the potential for growth there versus the rate of recovery in the overall global Automotive industry. What kind of outperformance would you expect on top of automotive production? It appears as though you guys talk about BMS and active noise cancellation in particular, but are there any specific drivers that you're most excited about?"

So yes, in fourth quarter, we were up 2% year-over-year. And actually, we had strength across all the applications. But even though our battery management solutions were down year-on-year, we did better than the auto market at large, and our position has gained strength with the new offerings that we have. And the sheer performance that we bring that nobody else can match in terms of the sensing, the signal processing. So I think that -- just looking at the prognostications of what electrification will do in the electric vehicle area, I think that's a growth trend for decade, 1.5 decades, 2 decades. So we feel good about that given our position.
I think also if you just look at the fourth quarter, I talked previously about our signal processing platform, high-performance signal processing platform based on our DSP, our A2B technology, road noise cancellation, A2B alone was up 70% in the year. So we've been talking about it a long time, but now the revenues are really coming home to roost in that area.
If I look at 1Q, typically, the automotive business for ADI is down seasonally, but we believe that it will be up. So the strength that we've been seeing coming through the fourth quarter here will continue into the first and beyond.
And if I look at just the areas that I feel really enthusiastic about, that we've been steering investment increasingly towards over the last 3 years or so. I've talked already about the electric vehicle markets. And we think about that as an opportunity from battery formation to battery deployment and battery disposal. So we're growing share in those key markets, and we continue to innovate in this space and create more [ blue sky ] between ourselves and our competition, as the problems that our customers are solving become more and more challenging. So we brought wireless BMS quite recently, which we've announced a partnership with GM on. But that is only the start. That is a new growth dimension for ADI in the automotive sector.
I've talked about infotainment already, A2B, road noise cancellation, and we managed to grow that business in 2020 despite the really, really compressed SAR.
The other thing I should point out is that we're still in the early innings of attaching our power franchise, the automotive, the critical applications in which we play. And that's all still ahead of us. Again, we feel good about that. In areas like safety, the radar, those vision-based safety systems and just in the car, in general, power is an area where we've made excellent progress, I think, getting design-ins. Now we're turning them to revenue."

And you're right there, the timing of next round of China 5G deployments are TBD. I think when they do happen, it will be a great business for us, and we'll continue to grow in that market, but it's very hard to call when that market will turn back on, sometime likely in the first half of '21, but really unsure to pinpoint it today when that's going to be, given all the geopolitical tensions out there. I think Vince did a good job talking about how it's not just about China. The good thing as you move to '21 is more global, 5G. North America should start taking off. Europe, Japan, Korea is really starting to broaden out and less about China. China still will be the biggest market, but really global 5G deployment should do better year-on-year in '21."
