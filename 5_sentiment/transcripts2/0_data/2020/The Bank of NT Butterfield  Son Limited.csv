I am very pleased with the bank's achievements in 2019 and the strides we have taken towards being the leading independent offshore Bank & Trust company. During the past year, we successfully pursued our acquisition and growth strategy that is focused on our established footprint in key jurisdictions, which include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands. In addition, we have a well-established, high net worth lending business in the U.K., primarily focused on Central London. We support these businesses with lower cost service centers in Canada and Mauritius, which provide us with ongoing expense leverage and expanded talent pool as we continue to move forward the client service proposition.
I wanted to acknowledge the resilience of our Cayman team and infrastructure. 2 weeks ago, there was a magnitude 7.7 earthquake very close to Cayman. While serious, I am thankful to say that there were no serious injuries and minimal damage.
Within 24 hours, we were back to business as usual, due to our strong business resilience framework.
Turning now to Slide 4. Butterfield reported strong annual net income of $177.1 million and record core operating income of $197.9 million. These earnings translate to annual core return on average tangible common equity of 23.4%. NIM of 2.86% for the year was down, primarily due to the acquisition of the Channel Islands, which was accretive to net interest income despite being NIM dilutive. Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency resulted in a core efficiency ratio of 62.2%. These efforts to moderate expense growth are particularly important in a lower interest rate environment and at a time when we are integrating a large acquisition.
I'm also encouraged by the growth in our loan book this year, which increased 27% due to our newly acquired business in the Channel Islands, new Bermuda and Cayman sovereign loans and our continued growth in the Central London mortgage book.
Our interest rate sensitivity has also moderated to a level that is more in line with U.S. regional bank peers due to increased fixed rate exposure in Ginnie Maes and customer loans. We consider capital management an important value driver with the majority of the bank's earnings supporting quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We continue to return excess capital to shareholders, while also considering accretive acquisition targets. Although we are not likely to consider any significant acquisitions until the latter part of 2020 or into next year where we fully integrate our recent channel Islands deal.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide commentary on the fourth quarter results."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%.

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%. The fourth quarter results benefited from our larger balance sheet, growth in noninterest income and a higher net interest margin.
Deposit costs fell by 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 50 basis points, contributing to a NIM of 2.59%. The Board of Directors continue to express confidence in our earnings profile, with the approval of a $0.44 per common share quarterly dividend, which is around a 5% annual yield at the current share price.
In addition to the dividend, Butterfield currently has an approved share repurchase program of up to 3.5 million common shares.
On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. Net interest income was flat in the quarter, while NIM increased 7 basis points compared to the last quarter due to an improved asset mix with increased volumes from loans. The average balance sheet of loans in the quarter increased by $351 million or 8%, while lower-yielding cash and short-term investments fell by $643 million or 14%.
We have continued the process of monitoring the customer flows from the ABM deal in the Channel Islands and expect to gradually improve productivity through deployment from cash into additional investment securities.
Looking now at Slide 8. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. As of December 31, 2019, total deposits were $12.4 billion, down approximately $221 million compared to the prior quarter. U.S. dollars represent 70% of deposits with sterling at 20% and other, which is primarily made up of euros, at 10%.
We have been successfully repricing EUR deposits, which is in line with our integration model, resulting in a modest attrition in euro balances in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits has dropped 4 basis points to 50 basis points, with term deposit costs falling 10 basis points to 1.38%, and demand deposit costs down 3 basis points to 25 basis points, each compared to the prior quarter.
Turning now to Slide 9. Fee income was up 6.6% in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter of contribution from the Channel Islands acquisition and increased seasonal merchant acquiring volumes, which tends to occur in the fourth quarter each year.
Cloud services contributed $6.4 million to the $14 million of banking noninterest income in the fourth quarter. The fee income ratio increased during the quarter to 37% from 35% in the prior quarter. The significant contribution from fee income as a percentage of Battlefield's total revenues contribute stable and capital-efficient earnings, and we believe this is a positive differentiator relative to U.S. retail banking peers.
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expenses, which have increased during the quarter to $91.6 million from $84 million in the prior quarter. Expense control remains a priority for management, while the fourth quarter included some specific client-focused investments and programs, which will reduce or disappear once full operational integration of ABM has achieved. This is still expected late in the second quarter of 2020.
The fourth quarter includes costs associated with the expansion of group service centers in preparation for our call center migration planned for the second quarter of 2020, acquisition-related integration and compliance review expenses in professional services as well as investment in our exciting new Camana Bay branch in the Cayman Islands and the launch of Butterfield's global rebranding initiative.
We continue to expect expenses to return to around the $88 million per quarter level, following the full operational integration in the Channel Islands in the second quarter of 2020.
Looking now at Slide 11. We provide a summary of capital levels. Balance capital management remains a key focus and we continue to manage to our target levels. Our TCE-to-TA ratio of 6.3% is within our target range of 6% to 6.5%. We believe that the current dividend payout ratio of 52.8% is sustainable and contemplates continued share repurchases and the potential to make further accretive acquisitions.
Turning now to Slide 12 and a discussion of the balance sheet. As we had anticipated, Butterfield's total assets reduced to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to reduce euro balances in the Channel islands. While the balance sheet is smaller, our earning assets have grown due to increased lending to the governments of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well as growth in our Central London mortgage books.
We continue to maintain a consistent and conservative underwriting profile. Additionally, balance sheet values that are reported in U.S. dollars benefited from a favorable sterling exchange rate at the year-end.
On Slide 13, we demonstrate the low credit risk in our investment portfolio with 99% of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, our loan book is comprised of 62% of residential mortgages, with 3 quarters of residential loans below 70% LTV as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans have continued to trend lower with a net charge-off ratio at 2 basis points.
We've completed our CECL adoption models and have determined the transitional adjustment to the total allowance for credit losses to be $7.8 million as at January 1, 2020. As discussed last quarter, this is within the expected range and consistent with the expected ranges of outcomes being communicated by other U.S. banks.
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. During the fourth quarter, Butterfield's asset sensitivity reduced significantly as we increased fixed rate assets with a large new fixed rate sovereign loan in the Cayman Islands and added London fixed rate mortgages. Additionally, with a more stable long-term U.S. rates outlook this quarter, the duration of the existing mortgage-backed securities portfolio extended by 3 months to 4 years.
We believe the current levels of interest rate sensitivity should provide improved earnings stability and protect value for the franchise and shareholders in future years.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

The integration of the Channel Islands acquisition is proceeding well, and I continue to be impressed with the high-quality of clients and new colleagues we gained with the deal. We anticipate the new business to be fully integrated by the end of the second quarter of 2020. In the interim, we're exploring potential acquisition targets and we'll continue to pursue M&A opportunities, which exceed our financial, geographic and business mix acquisition requirements.
Expense levels were higher than our targeted run rate this quarter, but we anticipate cost to normalize and the investment we made towards the business this quarter will benefit the bank in the fullness of time. We expect to buy back shares, subject to market conditions and believe the current quarterly cash dividend rate is an appropriate way to continue rewarding shareholders.
After more than a month into 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. We have footholds in the markets where we can most effectively help clients create wealth and build relationships. There are markets in which we have a long history and established right to compete for lending, banking, trust, high net worth clients and long-term affiliations with financial intermediaries.
Over the past year, our balance sheet has become more evenly distributed across Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands. We see opportunities in all of our locations with the Channel Islands likely to have the greatest opportunity for growth, either organically or by further acquisitions.

Obviously, the balance sheet also benefited from a very strong sterling rate at the end of the year, so that boosted the balance sheet values in dollar terms by about $150 million. I would say we're sort of halfway through that process, we probably have $300 million to $400 million still sort of what we would call at-risk deposits, primarily euros, again, in ABN.
As I mentioned just a moment ago, about 10% of deposits are now in other currencies, and it's primarily euros. Those customer relationships tend to be linked with other currency deposits. And so we're looking quite carefully at those, but broadly in line with where we announced the model."

But other than that, that quarter is fairly representative in terms of the first full quarter impact of ABN. Obviously, we're hoping to -- that, that creates a base for growth as well."

Thanks, David. I'm happy to give a bit more color around expenses. Obviously, we had some non-core expenses this quarter, which primarily relates to staff exit cost as part of the program to align staffing levels of the ABN to the go forward. So that was pretty much done last quarter. But in terms of the core expense run rate, as we look at some of the programs that we've been running out. The brand rollout, which primarily is around the new trademarks, new logo, new customer forums, credit cards, branded materials, et cetera, primarily booked in marketing in the quarter is probably high by about 1 million. There will be some elements of that program that will continue for the full year as we're adopting a phased approach. So we're telling, we're not replacing current credit cards that are still valid. But on renewal, they will be replaced to kind of try and protect some of the burn rate on that.
Property, new signage, we had some expanded space in the Halifax Center in anticipation of onboarding the call centers, which we had a partial impact this quarter of running multiple call centers, but that transition will flip over some of it this quarter and some of it next quarter. And then we had some moves in Bermuda as well, again, property-related for the new branch that we're refreshing here in Bermuda, again, that will be a fully rebranded branch as part of that.
We were just opening a new branch in Camana Bay this week. It looks fantastic. It should affect a lot of the mid-market corporate and private client footfall traffic in Cayman Islands.
And finally, we have some office moves in Guernsey as well to co-locate some of the RM teams in one building following ABN. So again, that's property is probably elevated this quarter, and this won't sort of recur fully, certainly, in the next quarters. Elements of that will come through, but that was probably almost 1 million there in terms of elevated expense levels.
The accelerated customer reviews of the ABN book. So we've taken a view that within a year, we'll look at all high and medium risk. Again, these are core expenses, but we expect completion again of that into 2Q 2020. It's growing pretty well. That's about $0.5 million in professional services there.
And then finally, we also worked on the integration for the ABN IT upgrade. So we're upgrading the system for our current customers in anticipation of having one banking system across the Channel Islands. So about $0.5 million there in salaries in IT, Again, that completes into Q2.
And then, obviously, we have some consulting fees in the fourth quarter as well. We had some purchase price allocation fees, professional services fees, the review of the loan book quite detailed to look for any impairments there, and that was probably $0.5 million, so that work is completed, was in Q4.
And that's kind of it for the quarter in terms of what I would call out there. I think over time, we're targeting flat year-on-year ex ABN in core expenses. So we expect to revert to the approximate $88 million run rate over the next couple of quarters, but probably not fully seen until Q3 this year. So we'll kind of gradually phase down as some of these programs phase out essentially."

And certainly, a very good dialogue at the board, and we continue to have that every quarter with the board. Again, the board keeps reiterating we have a balanced capital allocation. So it was, first and foremost, supporting a healthy and sustainable dividend rate, which approximate 50% payout ratio through the cycle. So we've been a bit low on that ratio coming up the rate curve. We're now a little bit more mature. So we've had a number of years where we've increased the dividend quite rapidly. And we're now at that 50% we're integrating a large new bank. So the sort of stable earnings profile of that and the organic growth profile of that is a bit up in the air as we're repricing some of those.
Secondly, we favor certainly buybacks at the moment, and we have a big authorization out there, which look attractive at a sort of 20% ROE in a single-digit forward PE valuation point.
Thirdly, selective M&A and organic growth support. We're going to continue to support core markets that we operate in, so the 3 primary banking markets, as well as look at M&A opportunities. We're sort of currently at the middle of the target TCE range. We were just at around 6% following the ABN deal and we have been certainly above the target range prior to the acquisition of M&A. So it's kind of a target range that we're sitting in the middle of right now.
The dividend rate, as I said, has discussed every -- and approved every quarter, especially given the ABN integration at the moment. And so overall, this supports the strategy, which remains really focused on growth in tangible book value over the long term."

We actually have passed on a couple of smaller trust opportunities recently. So we're continuing to have discussions. And look, but it's got to really fit all of our criteria. And so we'll keep focusing on it, but it's ABN at this point."

I would say the two, Bermuda and Cayman server loans are really specific transactions that are unlikely to be repeated. So as we said, we increased from Q3 to Q4 about 10%, 27% year-on-year, so to about $5.1 billion. Bermuda was about $100 million of that. So there was a $200 million Bermuda government facility that was really bridge financing to a new bond issue. We took $100 million of that, HSBC Bermuda took $100 million. It's only a 1-year term floating rate at about 4.25%.
Cayman was a great opportunity, $180 million loan, 15 years fixed at 3.25%. Obviously, both 0-risk weighted. So from a risk-adjusted perspective, really, really great opportunities for us. But the Bermuda one will come off pretty quickly. They may come back to us in the future, but it's really sort of one-off stuff. The Cayman is 15 years, so that will stay with us.
Butterfield mortgages had a really good quarter as Brexit -- the Brexit outcome became more clear. So that was about -- basically, about the same sort of quantum as the other 2. So we would never really sort of characterize ourselves as a loan growth story. Our strategy is still a lot to do and out-of-market lending even as rates rate decline. So that's still the focus, but we did get a little bit lucky this year, but part of it will come off.
So really helpful, but I would say that it's going to be relatively flat this year, maybe a little bit up."

I mean, I would just -- I'm just going to focus on the sort of bigger levers here. So obviously, there's a lot going on with the multi-currency and the repricing of the euro deposits. But essentially, we have that 25 basis points in the Bermuda mortgages coming through. Obviously, that's a downdraft on NIM in Q1 this year, so we priced with a 90-day lag. The term deposits rates will continue to reset at lower rates as they roll over, approximately 90% of term deposits or CDs roll over automatically. And with the rate reductions that we've already done following the market adjustments, we would expect for those to partly offset that downdraft in NIM.
Demand deposits is that that's going to improve slightly, but it will depend a little bit on the attrition levels in the ABN book. There's not much more that we can do in terms of the cost of deposits in the Bermuda and Cayman market.
So generally, I mean, overall, even with the securities side, I would say flattish. I mean, plus/minus a handful of basis points in the next couple of quarters. And then as we start to season the deposits in during the second half, we would expect a more meaningful improvement in overall NIM subject to, obviously, what the market is doing at that time. But that seasoning could translate on a full year basis into sort of a 70 basis points on $500 million to $700 million, depending on where we land on total deposits level for full year effect at the current market rates. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of sort of how we're thinking about it."

And certainly, Central London, which was the portion of our old bank that we kept, so we understand that market and fund it out of the Channel Islands with sterling.
So that's the #1 gating factor, I would say, Bermuda economically is relatively flat right now. So not a huge amount of loan demand, either on the residential or corporate side. Cayman actually is growing quite well. The economy is really growing at a 3% clip year-on-year. So we'll grow with GDP and with the economy. So I think there is some organic growth opportunities in Cayman over time. Butterfield mortgages limited, has done a great job. And I think with Brexit clearing up and having a better sense of where that's going, that will continue. So I think there's opportunities to grow in London and a little bit in Cayman with GDP. But again, I would just stress that the 2 transactions were very specific. I think Butterfield mortgages had a big bump because Brexit was kind of clearing up and Corbin didn't get elected, probably more importantly, so I think that's pretty clear.
But it's -- we keep saying it's not a loan growth story because I think if we said it were a loan growth story, that would actually imply that we'd be lending out of market, which is not something we're willing to do from a risk perspective, and we're in very small jurisdictions. So we do get lucky occasionally when you get big server facilities, but we will generally grow with GDP. In Bermuda, which is flat, Cayman maybe 3%. And I would think that London will do well, but we might have had a bump in Q4 because of the Brexit clarity.
So that's how I'd describe it."

Obviously, both our bank in Guernsey has been a corporate financial intermediary bank as is our new bank in Jersey, so that's our expertise in the Channel Islands. I would say, over time, as we get more and more comfortable with the environment, there is an opportunity over time that we could end up maybe looking a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman, where we would focus on residential lending and maybe some more fund lending, financial intermediaries, which we're doing a bit now.
But on the retail side, we are potentially having a look at it. The one most important factor is we're still 62% of our loan book across the group is residential mortgages and the other 30%, 40% actually is still kind of commercial lending, but it's all secured by property, and so it's very much like a residential mortgage. So that wouldn't change.
So if we're able to replicate that, what we've done in Bermuda and Cayman, with reasonable deposit rates, financial intermediary deposits funding the higher mortgage, higher-margin residential mortgages, it's something we will look at.

Obviously, loan growth is is being supported by the funding in sterling.

And the reason why we didn't deploy this quarter was we had these lending opportunities, which obviously was a better use of funds. I would say the primary focus, obviously, on reinvesting in existing maturities and that's what's driving slightly improved market rate outlook this quarter is helping our sensitivity in that regard.
And as we look into the second half of this year, we should see the AFS and HTM books starting to expand or getting that cash put to work, essentially, that's underpinning the customer deposits in the ABN book.
You should expect a pace of that similar to when we did the 2016 acquisition of HSBC here in Bermuda, where we got about EUR 1.6 billion of deposits. And we sort of typically target sort of -- end up targeting between 40% and 65% of deposits, so we get the cash balances back to just really a treasury management function. And then that gets flattered out over a period of sort of 9 to 12 quarters. And we continue to monitor flows to ensure that, obviously, we maintained considered liquidity buffers for ourselves during that time. So that could result in a deployment in the second half of this year at about $200 million a quarter over the subsequent sort of 8 quarters."

So I think the initial reception was quite good. I think both Guernsey and Jersey are experiencing a situation where there's a lot of indigenous banks and [indiscernible] U.K. banks that are actually kind of getting out of the market. So having a bank in Guernsey with a 10% or 15% market share and a new bank in Jersey with a small market share but the first in decades, the reception has been great. I think what always interests us is that when we take on a new bank or take on new clients that are institutional they actually get pretty comfortable with our credit quality.
Occasionally, if a client has $200 million or $300 million with us, they'll move some of it just from a size perspective. But I think when they kind of dig into our public information and being listed in New York, actually, for a small bank like us helps a lot because there's tons of information out there, they get very comfortable.
So we lost very few clients, ABN clients, just based on the fact we're not ABN. We're a much smaller bank. So that's a lot of the work. But perception's been great, I think the premise still holds. There's a dislocation in the market, a lot of sellers, very few buyers. So I think if we just continue to focus on making sure ABN's success, our relationships with both the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, Jersey Financial Services Commission are both very good. That's hugely important. So we want to make sure ABN is a success and continue to wait for more dislocation in the market. And we've really balanced our exposures across the 3 jurisdictions, which was one of the strategic goals of ours. And now really, it's about organic growth and maybe sort of layering on another acquisition when people get out.
So we -- we're the only bank or one of the few banks that visibly is really, really committed to that market. And I think it shows because clients don't want to move around. I mean, as everyone knows, trying to set up an account at any bank today is like pulling teeth. So it's important to have stability and I think we show that because we want to be in the market and clients understand that."

But what does that kind of assume around the $100 million bridge financing with the Bermuda sovereign? I mean, does that assume that, that stays for the next 12 months and then rolls out? So I imagine there will be some modest step down, just given the potential mix shift when that loan rolls off."

So if I think about the investment book, being part of that. And that will, to some extent, depend on the loan growth as well. So $15 million -- 15-year fixed rate loan is obviously a big draw on funding our liquidity for the bank as well to the Cayman Islands government. But I would say we target around a 5 year. It's been shorter because we've been seasoning in deposits from prior acquisitions. So the DB acquisition is done, got seasoned in. Prior to that, we had the HSBC acquisition. So we've always been a little bit shy of our target, really, on the investment book.
But I would say we're continuing -- we favor Ginnie's explicitly guaranteed issuances complexity instruments that give us that kind of a bell curve on the balance sheet. And then we have to be conservative at the short end, obviously, because we manage our own treasury positions between the different banking balance sheet. So I would say it hasn't really changed, given the rate outlook, it's just that we are continuing to do what we said we were going to do."

It's -- so we just got back from Cayman on Tuesday night, we had a Cayman bank subsidiary board meeting, and we opened Camana Bay branch. And I think the most important part is Camana Bay, for people that know Cayman, is a pretty new development that's residential, it's corporate, it's hospitality, restaurant sort of built from scratch.
So it's got scale. It sort of reached a critical mass in terms of development over the last 10 years. So I think our timing is pretty perfect.
The other Canadian banks, Scotia, RBC are both there. And it was sort of the one area that we haven't sort of developed. I'd say we're the largest bank in Cayman. We've been there 50 years. We're really considered the local bank, I think, for most Caymanians. And I think having -- not having a branch at Camana Bay kind of stood out.
It also gives an opportunity to really visibly launch our new brands. So it's a very different look and we're getting a lot of great comment about it. I think it's good for the Cayman employees as the bank continues to grow there. But most importantly, Cayman is doing well. So whether it's tourism or funding corporations or building, it actually is growing quite rapidly, relative to some of our other jurisdictions, and we really want to invest our capital in places that appear to have GDP that's going north.
Population has increased from about 60,000 to about 68,000 so it's pretty much an open economy and spending a couple of days down there. It feels like it really is booming. So we're just investing our capital in places where we think we have opportunities to grow."

I am very pleased with the bank's achievements in 2019 and the strides we have taken towards being the leading independent offshore bank and trust company. During the past year, we successfully pursued our acquisition and growth strategy that is focused on our established footprint in key jurisdictions, which include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands. In addition, we have a well-established, high net worth lending business in the U.K., primarily focused on Central London. We support these businesses with lower cost service centers in Canada and Mauritius, which provide us with ongoing expense leverage and expanded talent pool as we continue to move forward the client service proposition.
I wanted to acknowledge the resilience of our Cayman team and infrastructure. 2 weeks ago, there was a magnitude 7.7 earthquake very close to Cayman. While serious, I am thankful to say that there were no serious injuries and minimal damage. Within 24 hours, we were back to business as usual, due to our strong business resilience framework.
Turning now to Slide 4. Butterfield reported strong annual net income of $177.1 million and record core operating income of $197.9 million. These earnings translate to annual core return on average tangible common equity of 23.4%. NIM of 2.86% for the year was down, primarily due to the acquisition of the Channel Islands, which was accretive to net interest income despite being NIM dilutive. Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency resulted in a core efficiency ratio of 62.2%. These efforts to moderate expense growth are particularly important in a lower interest rate environment and at a time when we are integrating a large acquisition.
I'm also encouraged by the growth in our loan book this year, which increased 27% due to our newly acquired business in the Channel Islands, new Bermuda and Cayman sovereign loans and our continued growth in the Central London mortgage book.
Our interest rate sensitivity has also moderated to a level that is more in line with U.S. regional bank peers due to increased fixed rate exposure in Ginnie Maes and customer loans. We consider capital management an important value driver, with the majority of the bank's earnings supporting quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We continue to return excess capital to shareholders, while also considering an accretive acquisition target, although we are not likely to consider any significant acquisitions until the latter part of 2020 or into next year where we fully integrate our recent channel Islands deal.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide commentary on the fourth quarter results."

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%.

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%. The fourth quarter results benefited from our larger balance sheet, growth in noninterest income and a higher net interest margin.
Deposit costs fell by 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 50 basis points, contributing to a NIM of 2.59%. The Board of Directors continue to express confidence in our earnings profile, with the approval of a $0.44 per common share quarterly dividend, which is around a 5% annual yield at the current share price. In addition to the dividend, Butterfield currently has an approved share repurchase program of up to 3.5 million common shares.
On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. Net interest income was flat in the quarter, while NIM increased 7 basis points compared to the last quarter due to an improved asset mix, with increased volumes from loans. The average balance sheet of loans in the quarter increased by $351 million or 8%, while lower-yielding cash and short-term investments fell by $643 million or 14%.
We have continued the process of monitoring the customer flows from the ABN deal in the Channel Islands and expect to gradually improve productivity through deployment from cash into additional investment securities.
Looking now at Slide 8. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. As of December 31, 2019, total deposits were $12.4 billion, down approximately $221 million compared to the prior quarter. U.S. dollars represent 70% of deposits, with sterling at 20% and other, which is primarily made up of euros, at 10%.
We have been successfully repricing euro deposits, which is in line with our integration model, resulting in a modest attrition in euro balances in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits has dropped 4 basis points to 50 basis points, with term deposit costs falling 10 basis points to 1.38% and demand deposit costs down 3 basis points to 25 basis points, each compared to the prior quarter.
Turning now to Slide 9. Fee income was up 6.6% in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter of contribution from the Channel Islands acquisition and increased seasonal merchant-acquiring volumes, which tends to occur in the fourth quarter each year.
Cloud services contributed $6.4 million to the $14 million of banking noninterest income in the fourth quarter. The fee income ratio increased during the quarter to 37% from 35% in the prior quarter. The significant contribution from fee income as a percentage of Battlefield's total revenues contribute stable and capital-efficient earnings, and we believe this is a positive differentiator relative to U.S. retail banking peers.
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expenses, which have increased during the quarter to $91.6 million from $84 million in the prior quarter. Expense control remains a priority for management, while the fourth quarter included some specific client-focused investments and programs, which will reduce or disappear once full operational integration of ABN is achieved. This is still expected late in the second quarter of 2020.
The fourth quarter includes cost associated with the expansion of group service centers in preparation for our call center migration planned for the second quarter of 2020, acquisition-related integration and compliance review expenses in professional services as well as investment in our exciting new Camana Bay branch in the Cayman Islands and the launch of Butterfield's global rebranding initiative. We continue to expect expenses to return to around the $88 million per quarter level, following the full operational integration in the Channel Islands in the second quarter of 2020.
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of capital levels. Balance capital management remains a key focus and we continue to manage to our target levels. Our TCE-to-TA ratio of 6.3% is within our target range of 6% to 6.5%. We believe that the current dividend payout ratio of 52.8% is sustainable and contemplates continued share repurchases and the potential to make further accretive acquisitions.
Turning now to Slide 12 and a discussion of the balance sheet. As we had anticipated, Butterfield's total assets reduced to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to reduce euro balances in the Channel islands. While the balance sheet is smaller, our earning assets have grown due to increased lending to the governments of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well as growth in our Central London mortgage books. 
We continue to maintain a consistent and conservative underwriting profile. Additionally, balance sheet values that are reported in U.S. dollars benefited from a favorable sterling exchange rate at the year-end.
On Slide 13, we demonstrate the low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with 99% of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Our loan book is comprised of 62% of residential mortgages, with 3 quarters of residential loans below 70% LTV as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans have continued to trend lower, with a net charge-off ratio at 2 basis points.
We've completed our CECL adoption models and have determined the transitional adjustment to the total allowance for credit losses to be $7.8 million as at January 1, 2020. As discussed last quarter, this is within the expected range and consistent with the expected ranges of outcomes being communicated by other U.S. banks.
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet, with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. During the fourth quarter, Butterfield's asset sensitivity reduced significantly as we increased fixed rate assets with a large new fixed rate sovereign loan in the Cayman Islands and added London fixed rate mortgages. 
Additionally, with a more stable long-term U.S. rates outlook this quarter, the duration of the existing mortgage-backed securities portfolio extended by 3 months to 4 years. We believe the current levels of interest rate sensitivity should provide improved earnings stability and protect value for the franchise and shareholders in future years.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

The integration of the Channel Islands acquisition is proceeding well, and I continue to be impressed with the high-quality of clients and new colleagues we gained with the deal. We anticipate the new business to be fully integrated by the end of the second quarter of 2020. In the interim, we're exploring potential acquisition targets. And we'll continue to pursue M&A opportunities, which exceed our financial, geographic and business mix acquisition requirements.
Expense levels were higher than our targeted run rate this quarter, but we anticipate cost to normalize, and the investment we made towards the business this quarter will benefit the bank in the fullness of time. We expect to buy back shares, subject to market conditions and believe the current quarterly cash dividend rate is an appropriate way to continue rewarding shareholders.
After more than a month into 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. We have footholds in the markets where we can most effectively help clients create wealth and build relationships. There are markets in which we have a long history and an established right to compete for lending, banking, trust, high net worth clients and long-term affiliations with financial intermediaries.
Over the past year, our balance sheet has become more evenly distributed across Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands. We see opportunities in all of our locations with the Channel Islands likely to have the greatest opportunity for growth, either organically or by further acquisitions.

There will be some elements of that program that will continue for the full year as we're adopting a phased approach. So we're telling -- we're not replacing current credit cards that are still valid. But on renewal, they will be replaced to kind of try and protect some of the burn rate on that.
Property, new signage, we had some expanded space in the Halifax service center in anticipation of onboarding the call centers, which we had a partial impact this quarter of running multiple call centers, but that transition will flip over some of it this quarter and some of it next quarter. And then we had some moves in Bermuda as well, again, property-related for the new branch that we're refreshing here in Bermuda. Again, that will be a fully rebranded branch as part of that.
We were just opening a new branch in Camana Bay this week. It looks fantastic. It should attract a lot of the mid-market corporate and private client footfall traffic in Cayman Islands.
And finally, we have some office moves in Guernsey as well to co-locate some of the RM teams in one building following ABN. So again, that property is probably elevated this quarter. And these won't sort of recur fully, certainly, in the next quarters. Elements of that will come through, but there was probably almost 1 million there in terms of elevated expense levels.
The accelerated customer reviews of the ABN book, so we've taken a view that within a year, we'll look at all high and medium risk. Again, these are core expenses, but we expect completion again of that into 2Q 2020. It's growing pretty well. That's about $0.5 million in professional services there.
And then finally, we also worked on the integration for the ABN and IT upgrade. So we're upgrading the system for our current customers in anticipation of having one banking system across the Channel Islands. So about $0.5 million there in salaries in IT. Again, that completes into Q2.
And then, obviously, we had some consulting fees in the fourth quarter as well. We had some purchase price allocation fees, professional services fees, the review of the loan book, quite detailed to look for any impairments there. And that was probably $0.5 million. So that work is completed was in Q4.
And that's kind of it for the quarter in terms of what I would call out there. I think over time, we're targeting flat year-on-year ex ABN in core expenses. So we expect to revert to the approximate $88 million run rate over the next couple of quarters but probably not fully seen until Q3 this year. So we'll kind of gradually phase down as some of these programs phase out, essentially."

And certainly, a very good dialogue at the Board, and we continue to have that every quarter with the Board. Again, the Board keeps reiterating we have a balanced capital allocation. So it was, first and foremost, supporting a healthy and sustainable dividend rate, which approximate 50% payout ratio through the cycle. So we've been a bit low on that ratio coming up the rate curve. We're now a little bit more mature. So we've had a number of years where we've increased the dividend quite rapidly. And we're now at that 50%. We're integrating a large new bank. So the sort of stable earnings profile of that and the organic growth profile of that is a bit up in the air as we're repricing some of those.
Secondly, we favor certainly buybacks at the moment, and we have a big authorization out there, which look attractive at a sort of 20% ROE in a single-digit forward PE valuation point.
Thirdly, selective M&A and organic growth support. We're going to continue to support core markets that we operate in. So the 3 primary banking markets, as well as look at M&A opportunities. We're sort of currently at the middle of the target TCE range. We were just at around the 6% following the ABN deal, and we have been certainly above the target range prior to the acquisition of M&A. So it's kind of a target range that we're sitting in the middle of right now.
The dividend rate, as I said, is discussed every -- and approved every quarter, especially given the ABN integration at the moment. And so overall, this supports the strategy, which remains really focused on growth in tangible book value over the long term."

So there was a $200 million Bermuda government facility that was really bridge financing to a new bond issue. We took $100 million of that. HSBC Bermuda took $100 million. It's only a 1-year term floating rate at about 4.25%.
Cayman was a great opportunity, $180 million loan, 15 years fixed at 3.25%. Obviously, both 0-risk weighted. So from a risk-adjusted perspective, really, really great opportunities for us. But the Bermuda one will come off pretty quickly. They may come back to us in the future, but it's really sort of one-off stuff. The Cayman is 15 years, so that will stay with us.
Butterfield mortgages had a really good quarter as Brexit -- the Brexit outcome became more clear. So that was about -- basically, about the same sort of quantum as the other 2. So we would never really sort of characterize ourselves as a loan growth story. Our strategy is still a lot to do and the out-of-market lending even as rates rate decline. So that's still the focus. But we did get a little bit lucky this year, but part of it will come off. So really helpful, but I would say that it's going to be relatively flat this year, maybe a little bit up."

But essentially, we have that 25 basis points in the Bermuda mortgages coming through. Obviously, that's a downdraft on NIM in Q1 this year, so we priced with a 90-day lag. The term deposits rates will continue to reset at lower rates as they roll over. Approximately 90% of term deposits or CDs roll over automatically. And with the rate reductions that we've already done following the market adjustments, we would expect for those to partly offset that downdraft in NIM.
Demand deposits is -- that's going to improve slightly, but it will depend a little bit on the attrition levels in the ABN book. There's not much more that we can do in terms of the cost of deposits for -- in Bermuda and Cayman market.
So generally, I mean, overall, even with the securities side, I would say flattish, I mean, plus/minus a handful of basis points in the next couple of quarters. And then as we start to season the deposits in during the second half, we would expect a more meaningful improvement in overall NIM subject to, obviously, what the market is doing at that time. But that seasoning could translate on a full year basis into sort of a 70 basis points on $500 million to $700 million, depending on where we land on total deposits level for full year effect at the current market rates.

I would say, Bermuda, economically, is relatively flat right now. So not a huge amount of loan demand, either on the residential or corporate side. Cayman actually is growing quite well. The economy is really growing at a 3% clip year-on-year. So we'll grow with GDP and with the economy. So I think there is some organic growth opportunities in Cayman over time. Butterfield Mortgages Limited has done a great job. And I think with Brexit clearing up and having a better sense of where that's going, that will continue. So I think there's opportunities to grow in London and a little bit in Cayman with GDP. 
But again, I would just stress that the 2 sovereign transactions were very specific. I think Butterfield mortgages had a big bump because Brexit was kind of clearing up and Corbyn didn't get elected, probably more importantly. So I think that's pretty clear. But it's -- we keep saying it's not a loan growth story because I think if we said it were a loan growth story, that would actually imply that we'd be lending out of market, which is not something we're willing to do from a risk perspective. And we're in very small jurisdictions. So we do get lucky occasionally when you get big sovereign facilities. But we will generally grow with GDP in Bermuda, which is flat, Cayman maybe 3%.

But on the retail side, we are potentially having a look at it. The one most important factor is we're still 62% of our loan book across the group is residential mortgages, and the other 38%, 40% actually is still kind of commercial lending, but it's all secured by property. And -- so it's very much like a residential mortgage. So that wouldn't change.

And the multicurrency depositors, obviously, we want to handle with care and make sure that we're understanding their requirements and needs for banking with us. A lot of them have custody relationship, FX relationships as well. So that's the exercise we're going through at the moment. But I think the best -- our estimate is still the guidance that was put out."

We just rolled over existing maturities. I don't have the -- I don't have them right here with me. But essentially, we also got some extension, obviously, in the book due to some slower prepayment speeds in the book. So that helped.
And the reason why we didn't deploy this quarter was we had these lending opportunities, which, obviously, was a better use of funds. I would say the primary focus, obviously, on reinvesting in existing maturities, and that's what's driving slightly improved market rate outlook this quarter that's helping our sensitivity in that regard.
And as we look into the second half of this year, we should see the AFS and HTM books starting to expand or getting that cash put to work. Essentially, that's underpinning the customer deposits in the ABN book. You should expect a pace of that similar to when we did the 2016 acquisition of HSBC here in Bermuda, where we got about EUR 1.6 billion of deposits. And we sort of typically target sort of -- we end up targeting between 40% and 65% of deposits, so we get the cash balances back to just really a treasury management function. And then that gets flattered out over a period of sort of 9 to 12 quarters. And we continue to monitor flows to ensure that, obviously, we maintained -- conserve liquidity buffers for ourselves during that time. So that could result in a deployment in the second half of this year at about $200 million a quarter over the subsequent sort of 8 quarters."

So I think the initial reception was quite good. I think both Guernsey and Jersey are experiencing a situation where there's a lot of indigenous banks and subsidiaries [ tied to the ] U.K. banks that are actually kind of getting out of the market. So having a bank in Guernsey with a 10% or 15% market share and a new bank in Jersey with a small market share but the first in decades, the reception has been great. .
I think what always interests us is that when we take on a new bank or take on new clients that are institutional, they actually get pretty comfortable with our credit quality. Occasionally, if a client has $200 million or $300 million with us, they'll move some of it just from a size perspective. But I think when they kind of dig into our public information and being listed in New York, actually, for a small bank like us helps a lot. If there's tons of information out there, they get very comfortable.
So we lost very few clients, ABN clients, just based on the fact we're not ABN. We're a much smaller bank. So that's a lot of the work. But the reception has been great. I think the premise still holds. There's a dislocation in the market. A lot of sellers, very few buyers. So I think if we just continue to focus on making sure ABN is a success, our relationships with both the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, Jersey Financial Services Commission are both very good. That's hugely important. So we want to make sure ABN is a success and continue to wait for more dislocation in the market. And we've really balanced our exposures across the 3 jurisdictions, which was one of the strategic goals of ours. And now really, it's about organic growth and maybe sort of layering on another acquisition when people get out.
So we're the only bank or one of the few banks that visibly is really, really committed to that market. And I think it shows because clients don't want to move around. I mean, as everyone knows, trying to set up an account at any bank today is like pulling teeth. So it's important to have stability. And I think we show that because we want to be in the market, and clients understand that."

I mean, I think, again, we've been sort of fairly consistent in terms of -- we're always targeting a duration at around -- we behaviorized deposits out to 6 years at the moment. Based on our history, that could be longer. So if I think about the investment book being part of that, and that will, to some extent, depend on the loan growth as well. So $15 million -- 15-year fixed rate loan is obviously a big draw on funding our liquidity for the bank as well to the Cayman Islands government. But I would say we target around a 5 year. It's been shorter because we've been seasoning in deposits from prior acquisitions. So the DB acquisition is done. Got seasoned in. Prior to that, we had the HSBC acquisition. So we've always been a little bit shy of our target, really, on the investment book.
But I would say we're continuing -- we favor Ginnie's explicitly guaranteed issuances complexity instruments that give us that kind of a bell curve on the balance sheet. And then we have to be conservative at the short end, obviously, because we manage our own treasury positions between the different banking balance sheet. So I would say it hasn't really changed given the rate outlook, it's just that we are continuing to do what we said we were going to do."

And I think the most important part is Camana Bay, for people that know Cayman, is a pretty new development that's residential. It's corporate. It's hospitality, restaurant sort of built from scratch. So it's got scale. It sort of reached a critical mass in terms of development over the last 10 years. So I think our timing is pretty perfect.
The other Canadian banks, Scotia, RBC are both there. And it was sort of the one area that we haven't sort of developed. I'd say we're the largest bank in Cayman. We've been there 50 years. We're really considered the local bank, I think, for most Caymanians. And I think having -- not having a branch at Camana Bay kind of stood out.
It also gives an opportunity to really visibly launch our new brands. So it's a very different look, and we're getting a lot of great comment about it. I think it's good for the Cayman employees as the bank continues to grow there. But most importantly, Cayman is doing well. So whether it's tourism or funding corporations or building, it actually is growing quite rapidly, relative to some of our other jurisdictions. And we really want to invest our capital in places that appear to have GDP that's going north.
Population has increased from about 60,000 to about 68,000, so it's pretty much an open economy. And just spending a couple of days down there, it feels like it really is booming. So we're just investing our capital in places where we think we have opportunities to grow."

I am very pleased with the bank's achievements in 2019 and the strides we have taken towards being the leading independent offshore bank and trust company. During the past year, we successfully pursued our acquisition and growth strategy that is focused on our established footprint in key jurisdictions, which include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands. In addition, we have a well-established, high net worth lending business in the U.K., primarily focused on Central London. We support these businesses with lower-cost service centers in Canada and Mauritius, which provide us with ongoing expense leverage and expanded talent pool as we continue to move forward the client service proposition.
I wanted to acknowledge the resilience of our Cayman team and infrastructure. 2 weeks ago, there was a magnitude 7.7 earthquake very close to Cayman. While serious, I am thankful to say that there were no serious injuries and minimal damage. Within 24 hours, we were back to business as usual, due to our strong business resilience framework.
Turning now to Slide 4. Butterfield reported strong annual net income of $177.1 million and record core operating income of $197.9 million. These earnings translate to annual core return on average tangible common equity of 23.4%. NIM of 2.86% for the year was down, primarily due to the acquisition of the Channel Islands, which was accretive to net interest income despite being NIM dilutive. Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency resulted in a core efficiency ratio of 62.2%. These efforts to moderate expense growth are particularly important in a lower interest rate environment and at a time when we are integrating a large acquisition.
I'm also encouraged by the growth in our loan book this year, which increased 27% due to our newly acquired business in the Channel Islands, new Bermuda and Cayman sovereign loans and our continued growth in the Central London mortgage book.
Our interest rate sensitivity has also moderated to a level that is more in line with U.S. regional bank peers due to increased fixed rate exposure in Ginnie Maes and customer loans. We consider capital management an important value driver with the majority of the bank's earnings supporting quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We continue to return excess capital to shareholders, while also considering an accretive acquisition target, although we are not likely to consider any significant acquisitions until the latter part of 2020 or into next year where we fully integrate our recent Channel Islands deal.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide commentary on the fourth quarter results."

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%.

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%. The fourth quarter results benefited from our larger balance sheet, growth in noninterest income and a higher net interest margin.
Deposit costs fell by 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 50 basis points, contributing to a NIM of 2.59%. The Board of Directors continue to express confidence in our earnings profile with the approval of a $0.44 per common share quarterly dividend, which is around a 5% annual yield at the current share price. In addition to the dividend, Butterfield currently has an approved share repurchase program of up to 3.5 million common shares.
On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. Net interest income was flat in the quarter, while NIM increased 7 basis points compared to the last quarter due to an improved asset mix, with increased volumes from loans. The average balance sheet of loans in the quarter increased by $351 million or 8%, while lower-yielding cash and short-term investments fell by $643 million or 14%.
We have continued the process of monitoring the customer flows from the ABN deal in the Channel Islands and expect to gradually improve productivity through deployment from cash into additional investment securities.
Looking now at Slide 8. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. As of December 31, 2019, total deposits were $12.4 billion, down approximately $221 million compared to the prior quarter. U.S. dollars represent 70% of deposits, with sterling at 20% and other, which is primarily made up of euros, at 10%.
We have been successfully repricing euro deposits, which is in line with our integration model, resulting in a modest attrition in euro balances in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits has dropped 4 basis points to 50 basis points, with term deposit costs falling 10 basis points to 1.38% and demand deposit costs down 3 basis points to 25 basis points, each compared to the prior quarter.
Turning now to Slide 9. Fee income was up 6.6% in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter of contribution from the Channel Islands acquisition and increased seasonal merchant-acquiring volumes, which tends to occur in the fourth quarter each year.
Cloud services contributed $6.4 million to the $14 million of banking noninterest income in the fourth quarter. The fee income ratio increased during the quarter to 37% from 35% in the prior quarter. The significant contribution from fee income as a percentage of Battlefield's total revenues contribute stable and capital-efficient earnings, and we believe this is a positive differentiator relative to U.S. retail banking peers.
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expenses, which have increased during the quarter to $91.6 million from $84 million in the prior quarter. Expense control remains a priority for management, while the fourth quarter included some specific client-focused investments and programs, which will reduce or disappear once full operational integration of ABN is achieved. This is still expected late in the second quarter of 2020.
The fourth quarter includes cost associated with the expansion of group service centers in preparation for our call center migration planned for the second quarter of 2020, acquisition-related integration and compliance review expenses in professional services as well as investment in our exciting new Camana Bay branch in the Cayman Islands and the launch of Butterfield's global rebranding initiative. We continue to expect expenses to return to around the $88 million per quarter level, following the full operational integration in the Channel Islands in the second quarter of 2020.
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of capital levels. Balance capital management remains a key focus and we continue to manage to our target levels. Our TCE-to-TA ratio of 6.3% is within our target range of 6% to 6.5%. We believe that the current dividend payout ratio of 52.8% is sustainable and contemplates continued share repurchases and the potential to make further accretive acquisitions.
Turning now to Slide 12 and a discussion of the balance sheet. As we had anticipated, Butterfield's total assets reduced to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to reduce euro balances in the Channel Islands. While the balance sheet is smaller, our earning assets have grown due to increased lending to the governments of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well as growth in our Central London mortgage books. 
We continue to maintain a consistent and conservative underwriting profile. Additionally, balance sheet values that are reported in U.S. dollars benefited from a favorable sterling exchange rate at the year-end.
On Slide 13, we demonstrate the low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with 99% of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Our loan book is comprised of 62% of residential mortgages, with 3 quarters of residential loans below 70% LTV as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans have continued to trend lower, with a net charge-off ratio at 2 basis points.
We've completed our CECL adoption models and have determined the transitional adjustment to the total allowance for credit losses to be $7.8 million as at January 1, 2020. As discussed last quarter, this is within the expected range and consistent with the expected ranges of outcomes being communicated by other U.S. banks.
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. During the fourth quarter, Butterfield's asset sensitivity reduced significantly as we increased fixed rate assets with a large new fixed rate sovereign loan in the Cayman Islands and added London fixed rate mortgages. 
Additionally, with a more stable long-term U.S. rates outlook this quarter, the duration of the existing mortgage-backed securities portfolio extended by 3 months to 4 years. We believe the current levels of interest rate sensitivity should provide improved earnings stability and protect value for the franchise and shareholders in future years.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

The integration of the Channel Islands acquisition is proceeding well, and I continue to be impressed with the high-quality of clients and new colleagues we gained with the deal. We anticipate the new business to be fully integrated by the end of the second quarter of 2020. In the interim, we're exploring potential acquisition targets. And we'll continue to pursue M&A opportunities, which exceed our financial, geographic and business mix acquisition requirements.
Expense levels were higher than our targeted run rate this quarter, but we anticipate cost to normalize, and the investment we made towards the business this quarter will benefit the bank in the fullness of time. We expect to buy back shares, subject to market conditions and believe the current quarterly cash dividend rate is an appropriate way to continue rewarding shareholders.
After more than a month into 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. We have footholds in the markets where we can most effectively help clients create wealth and build relationships. There are markets in which we have a long history and an established right to compete for lending, banking, trust, high net worth clients and long-term affiliations with financial intermediaries.
Over the past year, our balance sheet has become more evenly distributed across Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands. We see opportunities in all of our locations with the Channel Islands likely to have the greatest opportunity for growth, either organically or by further acquisitions.
Thank you. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

I would say we're sort of halfway through that process. We probably have $300 million to $400 million still sort of what we would call at-risk deposits, primarily euros, again, in ABN. As I mentioned just a moment ago, about 10% of deposits are now in other currencies, and it's primarily euros. Those customer relationships tend to be linked with other currency deposits.

No. I'm happy -- thanks, David. I'm happy to give a bit more color around expenses. Obviously, we had some noncore expenses this quarter, which primarily relates to staff exit cost as part of the program to align staffing levels of the ABN to the go forward. So that was pretty much done last quarter. 
But in terms of the core expense run rate, as we look at some of the programs that we've been running out, the brand rollout, which primarily is around the new trademarks, new logo, new customer forums, credit cards, branded materials, et cetera, primarily booked in marketing in the quarter is probably high by about $1 million. There will be some elements of that program that will continue for the full year as we're adopting a phased approach. So we're telling -- we're not replacing current credit cards that are still valid. But on renewal, they will be replaced to kind of try and protect some of the burn rate on that.
Property, new signage, we had some expanded space in the Halifax service center in anticipation of onboarding the call centers, which we had a partial impact this quarter of running multiple call centers, but that transition will flip over some of it this quarter and some of it next quarter. And then we had some moves in Bermuda as well, again, property-related for the new branch that we're refreshing here in Bermuda. Again, that will be a fully rebranded branch as part of that.
We were just opening a new branch in Camana Bay this week. It looks fantastic. It should attract a lot of the mid-market corporate and private client footfall traffic in Cayman Islands.
And finally, we have some office moves in Guernsey as well to co-locate some of the RM teams in one building following ABN. So again, that property is probably elevated this quarter. And these won't sort of recur fully, certainly, in the next quarters. Elements of that will come through, but there was probably almost 1 million there in terms of elevated expense levels.
The accelerated customer reviews of the ABN book, so we've taken a view that within a year, we'll look at all high and medium risk. Again, these are core expenses, but we expect completion again of that into 2Q 2020. It's growing pretty well. That's about $0.5 million in professional services there.
And then finally, we also worked on the integration for the ABN and IT upgrade. So we're upgrading the system for our current customers in anticipation to -- of having one banking system across the Channel Islands. So about $0.5 million there in salaries in IT. Again, that completes into Q2.
And then, obviously, we had some consulting fees in the fourth quarter as well. We had some purchase price allocation fees, professional services fees, the review of the loan book, quite detailed to look for any impairments there. And that was probably $0.5 million. So that work is completed was in Q4.
And that's kind of it for the quarter in terms of what I would call out there. I think over time, we're targeting flat year-on-year ex ABN in core expenses. So we expect to revert to the approximate $88 million run rate over the next couple of quarters, but probably not fully seen until Q3 this year. So we'll kind of gradually phase down as some of these programs phase out, essentially."

And certainly, a very good dialogue at the Board and we continue to have that every quarter with the Board. Again, the Board keeps reiterating we have a balanced capital allocation. So it was, first and foremost, supporting a healthy and sustainable dividend rate, which approximates 50% payout ratio through the cycle. So we've been a bit low on that ratio coming up the rate curve. We're now a little bit more mature. So we've had a number of years where we've increased the dividend quite rapidly. And we're now at that 50%. We're integrating a large new bank. So the sort of stable earnings profile of that and the organic growth profile of that is a bit up in the air as we're repricing some of those.
Secondly, we favor certainly buybacks at the moment, and we have a big authorization out there, which look attractive at a sort of 20% ROE in a single-digit forward PE valuation point.
Thirdly, selective M&A and organic growth support. We're going to continue to support core markets that we operate in. So the 3 primary banking markets, as well as look at M&A opportunities. We're sort of currently at the middle of the target TCE range. We were just at around the 6% following the ABN deal and we have been certainly above the target range prior to the acquisition of M&A. So it's kind of a target range that we're sitting in the middle of right now.
The dividend rate, as I said, is discussed every -- and approved every quarter, especially given the ABN integration at the moment. And so overall, this supports the strategy, which remains really focused on growth in tangible book value over the long term."

It's only a 1-year term floating rate at about 4.25%.
Cayman was a great opportunity, $180 million loan, 15 years fixed at 3.25%. Obviously, both 0-risk weighted. So from a risk-adjusted perspective, really, really great opportunities for us. But the Bermuda one will come off pretty quickly. They may come back to us in the future, but it's really sort of one-off stuff. The Cayman is 15 years, so that will stay with us.
Butterfield mortgages had a really good quarter as Brexit -- the Brexit outcome became more clear. So that was about -- basically, about the same sort of quantum as the other 2. So we would never really sort of characterize ourselves as a loan growth story. Our strategy is still a lot to do and the out-of-market lending even as rates rate decline.

But essentially, we have that 25 basis points in the Bermuda mortgages coming through. Obviously, that's a downdraft on NIM in Q1 this year, so we priced with a 90-day lag. The term deposits rates will continue to reset at lower rates as they rollover. Approximately 90% of term deposits or CDs roll over automatically. And with the rate reductions that we've already done following the market adjustments, we would expect for those to partly offset that downdraft in NIM.
Demand deposits is -- that's going to improve slightly, but it will depend a little bit on the attrition levels in the ABN book. There's not much more that we can do in terms of the cost of deposits for -- in Bermuda and Cayman market.
So generally, I mean, overall, even with the securities side, I would say flattish, I mean, plus/minus a handful of basis points in the next couple of quarters. And then as we start to season the deposits in during the second half, we would expect a more meaningful improvement in overall NIM subject to, obviously, what the market is doing at that time. But that seasoning could translate on a full year basis into sort of a 70 basis points on $500 million to $700 million, depending on where we land on total deposits level for full year effect at the current market rates. So hopefully, that gives you a sense sort of how we're thinking about it."

So I would say that #1 gating factor is, as I said, we're not going to do out-of-market lending, which is Bermuda, Cayman, potentially the Channel Islands if we get it down that route. And certainly, Central London, which was the portion of our old bank that we kept. So we understand that market and fund it out of the Channel Islands with sterling. So that's the #1 gating factor. 
I would say, Bermuda, economically, is relatively flat right now. So not a huge amount of loan demand, either on the residential or corporate side. Cayman actually is growing quite well. The economy is really growing at a 3% clip year-on-year. So we'll grow with GDP and with the economy. So I think there is some organic growth opportunities in Cayman over time. Butterfield Mortgages Limited has done a great job. And I think with Brexit clearing up and having a better sense of where that's going, that will continue. So I think there's opportunities to grow in London and a little bit in Cayman with GDP. 
But again, I would just stress that the 2 sovereign transactions were very specific. I think Butterfield mortgages had a big bump because Brexit was kind of clearing up and Corbyn didn't get elected, probably more importantly. So I think that's pretty clear. But it's -- we keep saying it's not a loan growth story because I think if we said it were a loan growth story, that would actually imply that we'd be lending out of market, which is not something we're willing to do from a risk perspective. And we're in very small jurisdictions. So we do get lucky occasionally when you get big sovereign facilities. But we will generally grow with GDP in Bermuda, which is flat, Cayman maybe 3%. And I would think that London will do well. But we might have had a bump in Q4 because of the Brexit clarity. So that's how I'd describe it."

Obviously, both our bank in Guernsey has been a corporate financial intermediary bank as is our new bank in Jersey. So that's our expertise in the Channel Islands. I would say, over time, as we get more and more comfortable with the environment there, there is an opportunity over time that we could end up maybe looking a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman, where we would focus on residential lending and maybe some more fund lending, financial intermediaries, which we're doing a bit now.
But on the retail side, we are potentially having a look at it. The one most important factor is we're still 62% of our loan book across the group is residential mortgages and the other 38%, 40% actually is still kind of commercial lending, but it's all secured by property. And -- so it's very much like a residential mortgage. So that wouldn't change. So if we're able to replicate that, what we've done in Bermuda and Cayman, with reasonable deposit rates, financial intermediary deposits, funding higher mortgage -- higher-margin residential mortgages, it's something we will look at.

The early parts were easier to some extent in that they were primarily only euro depositors.

We just rolled over existing maturities. I don't have the -- I don't have them right here with me.

And the reason why we didn't deploy this quarter was we had these lending opportunities, which, obviously, was a better use of funds. I would say the primary focus, obviously, on reinvesting in existing maturities, and that's what's driving slightly improved market rate outlook this quarter that's helping our sensitivity in that regard.
And as we look into the second half of this year, we should see the AFS and HTM books starting to expand or getting that cash put to work. Essentially, that's underpinning the customer deposits in the ABN book. You should expect a pace of that similar to when we did the 2016 acquisition of HSBC here in Bermuda, where we got about EUR 1.6 billion of deposits. And we sort of typically target sort of -- we end up targeting between 40% and 65% of deposits, so we get the cash balances back to just really a treasury management function. And then that gets flattered out over a period of sort of 9 to 12 quarters. And we continue to monitor flows to ensure that, obviously, we maintained -- conserve liquidity buffers for ourselves during that time. So that could result in a deployment in the second half of this year at about $200 million a quarter over the subsequent sort of 8 quarters."

So I think the initial reception was quite good. I think both Guernsey and Jersey are experiencing a situation where there's a lot of indigenous banks and subserves high street U.K. banks that are actually kind of getting out of the market. So having a bank in Guernsey with a 10% or 15% market share and a new bank in Jersey with a small market share but the first in decades, the reception has been great. .
I think what always interests us is that when we take on a new bank or take on new clients that are institutional, they actually get pretty comfortable with our credit quality. Occasionally, if a client has $200 million or $300 million with us, they'll move some of it just from a size perspective. But I think when they kind of dig into our public information and being listed in New York, actually, for a small bank like us helps a lot. If there's tons of information out there, they get very comfortable.
So we lost very few clients, ABN clients, just based on the fact we're not ABN. We're a much smaller bank. So that's a lot of the work. But the reception has been great. I think the premise still holds. There's a dislocation in the market. A lot of sellers, very few buyers. So I think if we just continue to focus on making sure ABN is a success, our relationships with both the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, Jersey Financial Services Commission are both very good. That's hugely important. So we want to make sure ABN is a success and continue to wait for more dislocation in the market. And we've really balanced our exposures across the 3 jurisdictions, which was one of the strategic goals of ours. And now really, it's about organic growth and maybe sort of layering on another acquisition when people get out.
So we're the only bank or one of the few banks that visibly is really, really committed to that market. And I think it shows because clients don't want to move around. I mean, as everyone knows, trying to set up an account at any bank today is like pulling teeth. So it's important to have stability. And I think we show that because we want to be in the market, and clients understand that."

Based on our history, that could be longer. So if I think about the investment book being part of that, and that will, to some extent, depend on the loan growth as well. So $15 million -- 15-year fixed rate loan is obviously a big draw on funding our liquidity for the bank as well to the Cayman Islands government. But I would say we target around a 5 year. It's been shorter because we've been seasoning in deposits from prior acquisitions. So the DB acquisition is done, got seasoned in. Prior to that, we had the HSBC acquisition. So we've always been a little bit shy of our target, really, on the investment book.
But I would say we're continuing -- we favor Ginnie's explicitly guaranteed issuances complexity instruments that give us that kind of a bell curve on the balance sheet. And then we have to be conservative at the short end, obviously, because we manage our own treasury positions between the different banking balance sheet. So I would say it hasn't really changed given the rate outlook, it's just that we are continuing to do what we said we were going to do."

And I think the most important part is Camana Bay, for people that know Cayman, is a pretty new development that's residential. It's corporate. It's hospitality, restaurant sort of built from scratch. So it's got scale. It sort of reached a critical mass in terms of development over the last 10 years. So I think our timing is pretty perfect.
The other Canadian banks, Scotia, RBC are both there. And it was sort of the one area that we haven't sort of developed. I'd say we're the largest bank in Cayman. We've been there 50 years. We're really considered the local bank, I think, for most Caymanians. And I think having -- not having a branch at Camana Bay kind of stood out.
It also gives an opportunity to really visibly launch our new brands. So it's a very different look and we're getting a lot of great comment about it. I think it's good for the Cayman employees as the bank continues to grow there, but most importantly, Cayman is doing well. So whether it's tourism or funding corporations or building, it actually is growing quite rapidly, relative to some of our other jurisdictions. And we really want to invest our capital in places that appear to have GDP that's going north.
Population has increased from about 60,000 to about 68,000, so it's pretty much an open economy. And just spending a couple of days down there, it feels like it really is booming. So we're just investing our capital in places where we think we have opportunities to grow."

I am very pleased with the bank's achievements in 2019 and the strides we have taken towards being the leading independent offshore bank and trust company. During the past year, we successfully pursued our acquisition and growth strategy that is focused on our established footprint in key jurisdictions, which include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands. In addition, we have a well-established, high net worth lending business in the U.K., primarily focused on Central London. We support these businesses with lower-cost service centers in Canada and Mauritius, which provide us with ongoing expense leverage and expanded talent pool as we continue to move forward the client service proposition.
I wanted to acknowledge the resilience of our Cayman team and infrastructure. 2 weeks ago, there was a magnitude 7.7 earthquake very close to Cayman. While serious, I am thankful to say that there were no serious injuries and minimal damage. Within 24 hours, we were back to business as usual, due to our strong business resilience framework.
Turning now to Slide 4. Butterfield reported strong annual net income of $177.1 million and record core operating income of $197.9 million. These earnings translate to annual core return on average tangible common equity of 23.4%. NIM of 2.86% for the year was down, primarily due to the acquisition of the Channel Islands, which was accretive to net interest income despite being NIM dilutive. Our focus on lowering costs and improving efficiency resulted in a core efficiency ratio of 62.2%. These efforts to moderate expense growth are particularly important in a lower interest rate environment and at a time when we are integrating a large acquisition.
I'm also encouraged by the growth in our loan book this year, which increased 27% due to our newly acquired business in the Channel Islands, new Bermuda and Cayman sovereign loans and our continued growth in the Central London mortgage book.
Our interest rate sensitivity has also moderated to a level that is more in line with U.S. regional bank peers due to increased fixed-rate exposure in Ginnie Maes and customer loans. We consider capital management an important value driver with the majority of the bank's earnings supporting quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases. We continue to return excess capital to shareholders, while also considering an accretive acquisition target, although we are not likely to consider any significant acquisitions until the latter part of 2020 or into next year where we fully integrate our recent Channel Islands deal.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide commentary on the fourth quarter results."

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%.

During the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $43.9 million or $0.82 per share and $46.2 million or $0.87 per share on a core basis. Butterfield's core return on tangible equity was 21.1%. The fourth quarter results benefited from our larger balance sheet, growth in noninterest income and a higher net interest margin.
Deposit costs fell by 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 50 basis points, contributing to a NIM of 2.59%. The Board of Directors continue to express confidence in our earnings profile with the approval of a $0.44 per common share quarterly dividend, which is around a 5% annual yield at the current share price. In addition to the dividend, Butterfield currently has an approved share repurchase program of up to 3.5 million common shares.
On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. Net interest income was flat in the quarter, while NIM increased 7 basis points compared to the last quarter due to an improved asset mix, with increased volumes from loans. The average balance sheet of loans in the quarter increased by $351 million or 8%, while lower-yielding cash and short-term investments fell by $643 million or 14%.
We have continued the process of monitoring the customer flows from the ABN deal in the Channel Islands and expect to gradually improve productivity through deployment from cash into additional investment securities.
Looking now at Slide 8. On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. As of December 31, 2019, total deposits were $12.4 billion, down approximately $221 million compared to the prior quarter. U.S. dollars represent 70% of deposits, with sterling at 20% and other, which is primarily made up of euros, at 10%.
We have been successfully repricing euro deposits, which is in line with our integration model, resulting in a modest attrition in euro balances in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits has dropped 4 basis points to 50 basis points, with term deposit costs falling 10 basis points to 1.38% and demand deposit costs down 3 basis points to 25 basis points, each compared to the prior quarter.
Turning now to Slide 9. Fee income was up 6.6% in the fourth quarter due to the full quarter of contribution from the Channel Islands acquisition and increased seasonal merchant-acquiring volumes, which tends to occur in the fourth quarter each year.
Cloud services contributed $6.4 million to the $14 million of banking noninterest income in the fourth quarter. The fee income ratio increased during the quarter to 37% from 35% in the prior quarter. The significant contribution from fee income as a percentage of Battlefield's total revenues contribute stable and capital-efficient earnings, and we believe this is a positive differentiator relative to U.S. retail banking peers.
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expenses, which have increased during the quarter to $91.6 million from $84 million in the prior quarter. Expense control remains a priority for management, while the fourth quarter included some specific client-focused investments and programs, which will reduce or disappear once full operational integration of ABN is achieved. This is still expected late in the second quarter of 2020.
The fourth quarter includes cost associated with the expansion of group service centers in preparation for our call center migration planned for the second quarter of 2020, acquisition-related integration and compliance review expenses in professional services as well as investment in our exciting new Camana Bay branch in the Cayman Islands and the launch of Butterfield's global rebranding initiative. We continue to expect expenses to return to around the $88 million per quarter level, following the full operational integration in the Channel Islands in the second quarter of 2020.
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of capital levels. Balance capital management remains a key focus and we continue to manage to our target levels. Our TCE-to-TA ratio of 6.3% is within our target range of 6% to 6.5%. We believe that the current dividend payout ratio of 52.8% is sustainable and contemplates continued share repurchases and the potential to make further accretive acquisitions.
Turning now to Slide 12 and a discussion of the balance sheet. As we had anticipated, Butterfield's total assets reduced to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to reduce euro balances in the Channel Islands. While the balance sheet is smaller, our earning assets have grown due to increased lending to the governments of Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well as growth in our Central London mortgage books. 
We continue to maintain a consistent and conservative underwriting profile. Additionally, balance sheet values that are reported in U.S. dollars benefited from a favorable sterling exchange rate at the year-end.
On Slide 13, we demonstrate the low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with 99% of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Our loan book is comprised of 62% of residential mortgages, with 3 quarters of residential loans below 70% LTV as of December 31, 2019. Nonaccrual loans have continued to trend lower, with a net charge-off ratio at 2 basis points.
We've completed our CECL adoption models and have determined the transitional adjustment to the total allowance for credit losses to be $7.8 million as at January 1, 2020. As discussed last quarter, this is within the expected range and consistent with the expected ranges of outcomes being communicated by other U.S. banks.
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. During the fourth quarter, Butterfield's asset sensitivity reduced significantly as we increased fixed-rate assets with a large new fixed-rate sovereign loan in the Cayman Islands and added London fixed-rate mortgages. 
Additionally, with a more stable long-term U.S. rates outlook this quarter, the duration of the existing mortgage-backed securities portfolio extended by 3 months to 4 years. We believe the current levels of interest rate sensitivity should provide improved earnings stability and protect value for the franchise and shareholders in future years.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

The integration of the Channel Islands acquisition is proceeding well, and I continue to be impressed with the high-quality of clients and new colleagues we gained with the deal. We anticipate the new business to be fully integrated by the end of the second quarter of 2020. In the interim, we're exploring potential acquisition targets. And we'll continue to pursue M&A opportunities, which exceed our financial, geographic and business mix acquisition requirements.
Expense levels were higher than our targeted run rate this quarter, but we anticipate cost to normalize, and the investment we made towards the business this quarter will benefit the bank in the fullness of time. We expect to buy back shares, subject to market conditions and believe the current quarterly cash dividend rate is an appropriate way to continue rewarding shareholders.
After more than a month into 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned for continued profitable growth. We have footholds in the markets where we can most effectively help clients create wealth and build relationships. There are markets in which we have a long history and an established right to compete for lending, banking, trust, high net worth clients and long-term affiliations with financial intermediaries.
Over the past year, our balance sheet has become more evenly distributed across Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands. We see opportunities in all of our locations with the Channel Islands likely to have the greatest opportunity for growth, either organically or by further acquisitions.

I would say we're sort of halfway through that process. We probably have $300 million to $400 million still sort of what we would call at-risk deposits, primarily euros, again, in ABN. As I mentioned just a moment ago, about 10% of deposits are now in other currencies, and it's primarily euros. Those customer relationships tend to be linked with other currency deposits.

No. I'm happy -- thanks, David. I'm happy to give a bit more color around expenses. Obviously, we had some noncore expenses this quarter, which primarily relates to staff exit cost as part of the program to align staffing levels of the ABN to the go forward. So that was pretty much done last quarter. 
But in terms of the core expense run rate, as we look at some of the programs that we've been running out, the brand rollout, which primarily is around the new trademarks, new logo, new customer forums, credit cards, branded materials, et cetera, primarily booked in marketing in the quarter is probably high by about $1 million. There will be some elements of that program that will continue for the full year as we're adopting a phased approach. So we're telling -- we're not replacing current credit cards that are still valid. But on renewal, they will be replaced to kind of try and protect some of the burn rate on that.
Property, new signage, we had some expanded space in the Halifax service center in anticipation of onboarding the call centers, which we had a partial impact this quarter of running multiple call centers, but that transition will flip over some of it this quarter and some of it next quarter. And then we had some moves in Bermuda as well, again, property-related for the new branch that we're refreshing here in Bermuda. Again, that will be a fully rebranded branch as part of that.
We were just opening a new branch in Camana Bay this week. It looks fantastic. It should attract a lot of the mid-market corporate and private client footfall traffic in Cayman Islands.
And finally, we have some office moves in Guernsey as well to co-locate some of the RM teams in one building following ABN. So again, that property is probably elevated this quarter. And these won't sort of recur fully, certainly, in the next quarters. Elements of that will come through, but there was probably almost 1 million there in terms of elevated expense levels.
The accelerated customer reviews of the ABN book, so we've taken a view that within a year, we'll look at all high and medium risk. Again, these are core expenses, but we expect completion again of that into 2Q 2020. It's growing pretty well. That's about $0.5 million in professional services there.
And then finally, we also worked on the integration for the ABN and IT upgrade. So we're upgrading the system for our current customers in anticipation to -- of having one banking system across the Channel Islands. So about $0.5 million there in salaries in IT. Again, that completes into Q2.
And then, obviously, we had some consulting fees in the fourth quarter as well. We had some purchase price allocation fees, professional services fees, the review of the loan book, quite detailed to look for any impairments there. And that was probably $0.5 million. So that work is completed was in Q4.
And that's kind of it for the quarter in terms of what I would call out there. I think over time, we're targeting flat year-on-year ex ABN in core expenses. So we expect to revert to the approximate $88 million run rate over the next couple of quarters, but probably not fully seen until Q3 this year. So we'll kind of gradually phase down as some of these programs phase out, essentially."

And certainly, a very good dialogue at the Board and we continue to have that every quarter with the Board. Again, the Board keeps reiterating we have a balanced capital allocation. So it was, first and foremost, supporting a healthy and sustainable dividend rate, which approximates 50% payout ratio through the cycle. So we've been a bit low on that ratio coming up the rate curve. We're now a little bit more mature. So we've had a number of years where we've increased the dividend quite rapidly. And we're now at that 50%. We're integrating a large new bank. So the sort of stable earnings profile of that and the organic growth profile of that is a bit up in the air as we're repricing some of those.
Secondly, we favor certainly buybacks at the moment, and we have a big authorization out there, which look attractive at a sort of 20% ROE in a single-digit forward PE valuation point.
Thirdly, selective M&A and organic growth support. We're going to continue to support core markets that we operate in. So the 3 primary banking markets, as well as look at M&A opportunities. We're sort of currently at the middle of the target TCE range. We were just at around the 6% following the ABN deal and we have been certainly above the target range prior to the acquisition of M&A. So it's kind of a target range that we're sitting in the middle of right now.
The dividend rate, as I said, is discussed every -- and approved every quarter, especially given the ABN integration at the moment. And so overall, this supports the strategy, which remains really focused on growth in tangible book value over the long term."

We'll continue to focus on bank and trust company acquisitions, but really only in our existing jurisdictions, probably with an enhanced focus on, obviously, the Channel Islands, where we're growing well and also Singapore, where we've got a great new trust company, but we need to get some scale there.
We actually have passed on a couple of smaller trust opportunities recently. So we're continuing to have discussions and look, but its got to be -- its got to really fit all of our criteria. And so we'll keep focusing on it, but it's ABN at this point."

So as we said, we increased from Q3 to Q4 about 10%, 27% year-on-year, so to about $5.1 billion. Bermuda was about $100 million of that. So there was a $200 million Bermuda government facility that was really bridge financing to a new bond issue. We took $100 million of that. HSBC Bermuda took $100 million. It's only a 1-year term floating rate at about 4.25%.
Cayman was a great opportunity, $180 million loan, 15 years fixed at 3.25%. Obviously, both 0-risk weighted. So from a risk-adjusted perspective, really, really great opportunities for us. But the Bermuda one will come off pretty quickly. They may come back to us in the future, but it's really sort of one-off stuff. The Cayman is 15 years, so that will stay with us.
Butterfield mortgages had a really good quarter as Brexit -- the Brexit outcome became more clear. So that was about -- basically, about the same sort of quantum as the other 2. So we would never really sort of characterize ourselves as a loan growth story. Our strategy is still a lot to do and the out-of-market lending even as rates rate decline. So that's still the focus, but we did get a little bit lucky this year, but part of it will come off. So really helpful, but I would say that it's going to be relatively flat this year, maybe a little bit up."

But essentially, we have that 25 basis points in the Bermuda mortgages coming through. Obviously, that's a downdraft on NIM in Q1 this year, so we priced with a 90-day lag. The term deposits rates will continue to reset at lower rates as they roll over. Approximately 90% of term deposits or CDs roll over automatically. And with the rate reductions that we've already done following the market adjustments, we would expect for those to partly offset that downdraft in NIM.
Demand deposits is -- that's going to improve slightly, but it will depend a little bit on the attrition levels in the ABN book. There's not much more that we can do in terms of the cost of deposits for -- in Bermuda and Cayman market.
So generally, I mean, overall, even with the securities side, I would say flattish, I mean, plus/minus a handful of basis points in the next couple of quarters. And then as we start to season the deposits in during the second half, we would expect a more meaningful improvement in overall NIM subject to, obviously, what the market is doing at that time. But that seasoning could translate on a full year basis into sort of a 70 basis points on $500 million to $700 million, depending on where we land on total deposits level for full year effect at the current market rates. So hopefully, that gives you a sense sort of how we're thinking about it."

I would say, Bermuda, economically, is relatively flat right now. So not a huge amount of loan demand, either on the residential or corporate side. Cayman actually is growing quite well. The economy is really growing at a 3% clip year-on-year. So we'll grow with GDP and with the economy. So I think there is some organic growth opportunities in Cayman over time. Butterfield Mortgages Limited has done a great job. And I think with Brexit clearing up and having a better sense of where that's going, that will continue. So I think there's opportunities to grow in London and a little bit in Cayman with GDP. 
But again, I would just stress that the 2 sovereign transactions were very specific. I think Butterfield mortgages had a big bump because Brexit was kind of clearing up and Corbyn didn't get elected, probably more importantly. So I think that's pretty clear. But it's -- we keep saying it's not a loan growth story because I think if we said it were a loan growth story, that would actually imply that we'd be lending out of market, which is not something we're willing to do from a risk perspective. And we're in very small jurisdictions. So we do get lucky occasionally when you get big sovereign facilities. But we will generally grow with GDP in Bermuda, which is flat, Cayman maybe 3%. And I would think that London will do well. But we might have had a bump in Q4 because of the Brexit clarity. So that's how I'd describe it."

But on the retail side, we are potentially having a look at it. The one most important factor is we're still 62% of our loan book across the group is residential mortgages and the other 38%, 40% actually is still kind of commercial lending, but it's all secured by property. And -- so it's very much like a residential mortgage. So that wouldn't change. So if we're able to replicate that, what we've done in Bermuda and Cayman, with reasonable deposit rates, financial intermediary deposits, funding higher mortgage -- higher-margin residential mortgages, it's something we will look at.

And the reason why we didn't deploy this quarter was we had these lending opportunities, which, obviously, was a better use of funds. I would say the primary focus, obviously, on reinvesting in existing maturities, and that's what's driving slightly improved market rate outlook this quarter that's helping our sensitivity in that regard.
And as we look into the second half of this year, we should see the AFS and HTM books starting to expand or getting that cash put to work. Essentially, that's underpinning the customer deposits in the ABN book. You should expect a pace of that similar to when we did the 2016 acquisition of HSBC here in Bermuda, where we got about EUR 1.6 billion of deposits. And we sort of typically target sort of -- we end up targeting between 40% and 65% of deposits, so we get the cash balances back to just really a treasury management function. And then that gets flattered out over a period of sort of 9 to 12 quarters. And we continue to monitor flows to ensure that, obviously, we maintained -- conserve liquidity buffers for ourselves during that time. So that could result in a deployment in the second half of this year at about $200 million a quarter over the subsequent sort of 8 quarters."

So I think the initial reception was quite good. I think both Guernsey and Jersey are experiencing a situation where there's a lot of indigenous banks and subserves high street U.K. banks that are actually kind of getting out of the market. So having a bank in Guernsey with a 10% or 15% market share and a new bank in Jersey with a small market share but the first in decades, the reception has been great. .
I think what always interests us is that when we take on a new bank or take on new clients that are institutional, they actually get pretty comfortable with our credit quality. Occasionally, if a client has $200 million or $300 million with us, they'll move some of it just from a size perspective. But I think when they kind of dig into our public information and being listed in New York, actually, for a small bank like us helps a lot. If there's tons of information out there, they get very comfortable.
So we lost very few clients, ABN clients, just based on the fact we're not ABN. We're a much smaller bank. So that's a lot of the work. But the reception has been great. I think the premise still holds. There's a dislocation in the market. A lot of sellers, very few buyers. So I think if we just continue to focus on making sure ABN is a success, our relationships with both the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, Jersey Financial Services Commission are both very good. That's hugely important. So we want to make sure ABN is a success and continue to wait for more dislocation in the market. And we've really balanced our exposures across the 3 jurisdictions, which was one of the strategic goals of ours. And now really, it's about organic growth and maybe sort of layering on another acquisition when people get out.
So we're the only bank or one of the few banks that visibly is really, really committed to that market. And I think it shows because clients don't want to move around. I mean, as everyone knows, trying to set up an account at any bank today is like pulling teeth. So it's important to have stability. And I think we show that because we want to be in the market, and clients understand that."

I mean, I think, again, we've been sort of fairly consistent in terms of -- we're always targeting a duration at around -- we behaviorized deposits out to 6 years at the moment. Based on our history, that could be longer. So if I think about the investment book being part of that, and that will, to some extent, depend on the loan growth as well. So $15 million -- 15-year fixed-rate loan is obviously a big draw on funding our liquidity for the bank as well to the Cayman Islands government. But I would say we target around a 5 year. It's been shorter because we've been seasoning in deposits from prior acquisitions. So the DB acquisition is done, got seasoned in. Prior to that, we had the HSBC acquisition. So we've always been a little bit shy of our target, really, on the investment book.
But I would say we're continuing -- we favor Ginnie's explicitly guaranteed issuances complexity instruments that give us that kind of a bell curve on the balance sheet. And then we have to be conservative at the short end, obviously, because we manage our own treasury positions between the different banking balance sheet. So I would say it hasn't really changed given the rate outlook, it's just that we are continuing to do what we said we were going to do."

We had a Cayman bank subsidiary Board meeting and we opened Camana Bay branch. And I think the most important part is Camana Bay, for people that know Cayman, is a pretty new development that's residential. It's corporate. It's hospitality, restaurant sort of built from scratch. So it's got scale. It sort of reached a critical mass in terms of development over the last 10 years. So I think our timing is pretty perfect.
The other Canadian banks, Scotia, RBC are both there. And it was sort of the one area that we haven't sort of developed. I'd say we're the largest bank in Cayman. We've been there 50 years. We're really considered the local bank, I think, for most Caymanians. And I think having -- not having a branch at Camana Bay kind of stood out.
It also gives an opportunity to really visibly launch our new brands. So it's a very different look and we're getting a lot of great comment about it. I think it's good for the Cayman employees as the bank continues to grow there, but most importantly, Cayman is doing well. So whether it's tourism or funding corporations or building, it actually is growing quite rapidly, relative to some of our other jurisdictions. And we really want to invest our capital in places that appear to have GDP that's going north.
Population has increased from about 60,000 to about 68,000, so it's pretty much an open economy. And just spending a couple of days down there, it feels like it really is booming. So we're just investing our capital in places where we think we have opportunities to grow."

But one of the access points that we were missing in Cayman is a lot of the nexus of the mid-market corporate business, so the fund admin companies, the captive insurance companies, have moved their offices to Camana Bay. And so this facility really allows us to have meeting rooms for meeting with clients like Aon and Marsh. So the corporate banking folks can get out and have a meeting room with them. And I think we'll continue to certainly keep that market share as well as increase our retail market share over time."

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum for additional details on COVID-19 from a credit perspective and comments on the first quarter results. 
Turning now to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. We reported net income of $40.3 million or $0.77 per share and core net income of $40.8 million and $0.78 per share. In the first quarter, net income was 8% lower than the previous quarter due to seasonal fee income and $5.2 million CECL reserve build for future expected credit losses. Our core return on average tangible common equity was 18.6%, down from 21.1% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 2.63% compared to the last quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 8 basis points to 42 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 5. As we operate across small Island communities, Butterfield has an important role to play as an essential service provider, a domestic systemically important bank, an employer, a source of working capital for companies in need and an active corporate supporting our communities. We have a particularly strong sense of responsibility to balance the needs of all stakeholders during this time. The COVID-19 virus is evident in and impacting all of our operating jurisdictions. The number of infections and deaths in our various locations have been consistent with the statistics we are seeing globally. For Bermuda, there have been over 100 cases identified and sadly, 6 deaths. Cayman Islands have identified over 70 cases with 1 known death. And between Guernsey and Jersey, there have been hundreds of confirmed cases with known death as well. At this point, we only have 1 confirmed employee case in our Swiss office, who is expected to make a full recovery. We would like to express our deepest sympathies to anyone who has been directly affected or lost a loved one to the virus. We remain hopeful that the current shelter in place and social distancing practices will continue to slow the spread of the virus so that local economies and tourism can start to recover. 
When the severity of the crisis and health implications became known, the bank's initial focus was on the well-being of our customers and employees, including our ability to continue providing essential banking services. We quickly began mandating social distancing, providing protective equipment for staff, implementing split team and building strategies and establishing broad remote working conditions through our virtual desktop interface. We have remained operational as permitted, with just over 70% of employees working from home and providing all necessary equipment and services to support our employees and customers. 
To help ease the financial impact on the community, we have temporarily deferred residential mortgage payments, reduced fees and increased our direct contributions to urgent care programs supporting the most vulnerable people. In the short term, we are working with clients to assess their needs and provide support. In Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is an important contributor to local activity as well as exports, we are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining frequent engagement with clients. In our estimation, the duration of the temporary shelter-in-place lockdown conditions is one of the most critical factors which will determine the return of economic activity and ultimately, the future impact on Butterfield. 
The bank keeps a significant source of liquidity available, primarily $3 billion of cash and short-term securities as well as $4.5 billion of U.S. agency MBS. Together, this represents just under 2/3 of all customer deposits. The current interest rate environment will impact our interest earnings from short-term securities as well as our variable rate loans and while lower deposit rates are unlikely to entirely offset the lost interest income. We also are seeing significantly decreased card services fees with no tourism and subdued domestic economic activity. 
Over the coming periods, we may also see increased prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio as U.S. home borrowers seek to refinance home loans in a lower interest rate environment. As we think about the medium and longer-term implications in the 3- to 5-year time frames, a sustained long-term ultralow interest rate environment could likely erode profitability over time. The bank has historically benefited from lower-cost deposit funding. However, in an ultralow interest rate environment, the value of those deposits reduces significantly and lower agency reinvestment rates would combine to compress NIM. This could ultimately alter earnings profile of the bank and would result in increased reliance on fee businesses. If interest rates fall further to negative rates, we could be in a position to charge negative interest rates on deposits, as we have witnessed in Europe. We would also need to become more efficient through accelerated cost reductions. 
On the capital side, we are pleased to continue at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.44 per share, which represents a strong yield at recent share prices and remain active on share repurchases. We continue to believe the dividend rate is sustainable and continues to be a capital management priority. It is possible that M&A opportunities could become available as larger onshore financial institutions with banking and trust operations in our current operating jurisdictions may decide to focus on their core businesses and may want to sell less strategically important assets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide additional information on the bank's credit portfolio and potential COVID-exposed areas and then add some additional details regarding the first quarter results, including a discussion on the bank's capital position and management."

Before I give an overview of the first quarter results, I wanted to provide some information on some specific credit exposures. As you can see on the bottom left of Slide 5, we have fairly limited direct credit exposure to hotel and restaurant lending sectors, which is primarily in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Hotel operators and construction loans represent our biggest direct commercial COVID-related credit risk. However, given the structure of the deals, generally at below 50% precrisis LTVs and the underlying financial strength of the borrowers, we are not currently expecting significant losses from this area. If the crisis lingers several more quarters, one of the emerging areas where customers could start to see challenges may be in the part of the residential book with borrowers who currently work in tourism-related businesses. Finally, we do not have any direct exposure to the oil exploration or production sector. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and some details regarding the first quarter results. On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the first quarter, NIM of 2.63% increased 4 basis points as the cost of deposits, particularly home deposits, decreased from rollovers, which more than offset the decrease in interest income. Lower rates were partially passed along to borrowers, with yields on variable rate loans being 15 basis points lower in the quarter. Average loans increased during the first quarter as we had the benefit of a full quarter of lending to the Bermuda and Cayman government, which were drawn late in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. Deposits at March 31, 2020, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 5.5% from the end of the year. The decrease is the result of the expected attrition of euro balances in the Channel Islands, which is consistent with previous guidance on the ABN deal. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 8 basis points due to lower term deposit pricing on rollovers. It is also worth noting that during the '08 and '09 financial crisis, overall customer deposit levels did not reduce significantly, and at this point, we continue to see stability in deposit levels. 
Looking now at Slide 9. Noninterest income was down 4.3% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower card services fees, which were negatively impacted by reduced volumes as economic activity stalled in March due to government lockdowns. 
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense. As we discussed last quarter, first quarter expenses returned to the expected range after being elevated in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to reduced headcount in the Channel Islands, lower marketing expenses, travel expenses and client event costs. We continue to target a true cycle efficiency ratio of 60%. 
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues with our conservative capital management philosophy that balances regulatory requirements with shareholder returns. Tangible book value per share increased 4.6% in the first quarter due to contributions from earnings and OCI related to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We continue to view the dividend as the most direct and efficient way to translate a high ROE of the business to investor return. The dividend coverage ratio remains around 2x, and we believe the current dividend rate is sustainable. Our capital management priorities have not changed and continue to support the dividend, organic loan growth, share repurchases in appropriate market conditions and maintaining flexibility to pursue M&A deals when the right opportunities arise. 
Turning now to Slide 12. During the first quarter, the balance sheet was broadly stable, except for the continued decline in the euro-denominated deposits in the Channel Islands, as expected. End-of-period loan balances were down almost 3% due to the lower dollar value of pound sterling-denominated loans in the Channel Islands and the U.K. With the significant fall in U.S. interest rates, total net unrealized in the investment portfolio were $155 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $61 million at the year-end. 
On Slide 13, we continue to emphasize low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with the majority of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Loans are mostly residential and full [ recourse ] with 75% of the portfolio in the below 70% LTV bucket. In light of COVID-19 and its potential future impact on particularly unsecured loans, we have increased our reserve estimate by $5.2 million, and the total reserve under CECL is now 72 basis points of gross loans, reflective of the collateral-backed residential lending platforms built over the last decade. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. The structural asset sensitivity of the balance sheet has now been entirely realized by the reduction in front-end rates. Therefore, the downside 100 basis points scenario would start to increase NII if the bank passes negative rates on to customers by increasing spread on demand deposits. The assumption on negative U.S. dollar deposit rates would be similar to what we've seen in Europe. In the upside 100 basis point scenario, the bank starts to increase net interest income with a positive differential between deposit and market rates. Additionally, reinvestment rates would improve, thereby improving net interest income also. 
I'll now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Butterfield's integration in the Channel Island is progressing well and into its final stages. We now expect the full operational integration to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 as most clients are also working remotely, and it is practically much safer to upgrade their banking systems once customers are back in their offices sometimes in the second quarter of 2020. 
Following the success of the Channel Islands, we remain committed to exploring potential acquisitions in banking and trust, with most opportunities in the Channel Islands for banking and trust. For the trust network, we would also seek to build on the potential in Asia with a larger trust presence in Singapore. While we do not have any specific communications on this at the moment, these discussions are still continuing. 
The effect of this health crisis on Butterfield will depend on uncertain factors, including the length and depth of the pandemic and associated government lockdowns, how that impacts domestic economic activity and tourism, how quickly can these recover as well as the interest rate environment. Our communications with the regulators, rating agencies and governments remain constructive and supportive. 
The bank continues to have a strong and flexible capital position with a very liquid balance sheet. Learning from the financial crisis a decade ago, Butterfield's credit underwriting has been conservative, and as a result, our exposure to potentially problematic sectors is limited and should place the bank in a strong position to emerge from the current crisis. 
As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity again to thank our employees, particularly those in the front line and retail branches, continuing to welcome customers and helping them and us through a difficult period. Thank you.

Thanks, Timur. It's Michael Schrum. Good question. A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model.

A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model. We don't use a third-party service provider to provide data as all of our loans are primarily manually underwritten. And so we use part of our own history -- repayment history, obviously, and local market conditions and where we operate. We do use, of course, external data in the model, including primarily unemployment forecasts as well as GDP forecasts. And for that, we use a combination of service providers, including Moody's and Bloomberg. 
The underlying assumptions for the model going in to this year, obviously, changed a lot since the end of the year, which is driving the additional reserve build in this quarter. So overall, we've landed on a negative 3 GDP -- U.S. GDP forecast for this year, which is one of the central assumptions. Obviously, that has a big shock in the second quarter to economic activity of double digits and then sort of a -- more of a U-shaped recovery into Q4. Again, the model is somewhat sensitive, obviously, to the external variables. But I would say, because most of the loan book is residential and manually underwritten, we have more of a straight line to realizing collateral in a troubled situation. So it mostly impacts the loan buckets that are -- where debt service coverage is really cash flow-based, so that would be the sort of C&I book and a credit card book. But again, those are relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So hopefully, that helps a bit."

And we are getting some of that where people don't want to stretch the term of the mortgage, but it's pretty much across the residential book. 
On the commercial side, we're working with all of our commercial customers, daily trying to find out how they're doing and figuring out where we can help. So that's obviously very specific discussions individually as opposed to any broader program. We're going to look at it in 3 months on the residential side, see where we are. There is some chance we could extend it for an additional period. But obviously, everything's so fluid right now. We're just going to wait and see.

I mean, interestingly, restaurants are about $7 million, which is obviously really contained. In terms of the hotel book, we have a couple of big hotel loans that are currently in operation, 2 or 3. We think they're well underwritten. And they have sort of broader context. So one of them, as an example, has a large condominium project that's been running for years associated with it. So a big part of our repayment actually comes from expats in these condos as opposed to the hotel itself. One of the other operating loans is a wealthy relationship that we have a far broader deeper relationship and have real clear a lot of sight in terms of the family's wealth. So it's a hotel, it's secured by hotel, but it's really a much, much broader relationship than that. 
And then on the hotel construction, you hit it on the head. I mean we have the St. George's hotel that's really being built and is well on its way. We'll -- plan is to open up next year, which is hopefully not too bad timing given the fact it will be summer next year. We'll have some time to see how this all plays out. And on that loan, the Bermuda government has guaranteed $25 million out of our $60 million commitment. And lots of equity, lots of equity upfront, completely different underwriting than the bank did pre-financial crisis. So we feel pretty comfortable about both the total size relative to our total credit portfolio and also the individual credits within it. So we think it's pretty contained."

Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%. That's actually a Chamber of Commerce projection as opposed to government. Guernsey is minus 15% and Jersey is minus 6%. Well, I -- it's -- everyone's sort of just trying to figure out where it's going. Obviously, Cayman has a bit more tourism exposure, so there, 25% of GDP is tourism, while Bermuda is only 17%, and the Channel Islands is very little. Jersey's got some. So I'd say it's fair to say it's going to be double-digit declines in 2020, maybe lower to mid double-digit. But obviously, this is uncharted territory, so let's just see how that goes. 
In Bermuda, there's been a few small stimulus steps so far. So really small, just a sort of a $12 million small business government-guaranteed program. Bermuda just set up unemployment insurance for the first time and has put out close to $20 million. A few thousand people are getting unemployment, weekly checks, processed through banks, direct credit for the first time ever. So that's really stimulus. I think the Ministry of Finance will come out in the near term and come up with a broader program. But at this point, Bermuda hasn't really stated exactly what the broader stimulus is going to be. But we do know that there's going to be some more borrowing in Bermuda to support it. Cayman has a surplus, has some reserves that they can use. They're talking about potentially borrowing a few hundred million in Guernsey and Jersey as well. So they're all in different stages of thinking about using their reserves in the other 3 islands and figuring out what sort of amount they want to borrow. And I'd say it's -- sort of 10% of GDP is pretty much across the board, so a few hundred million, maybe up to $500 million. And we want to be as helpful as possible in all our jurisdictions from a credit perspective. We know these economies better than anybody, so it's a good time to be able to support the governments. So mixed stimulus. It's sort of evolving. The U.K., obviously, is in a different situation, much broader programs. But I think the islands actually are going to be somewhat contained in terms of throwing money at it. So that's sort of where it is."

And obviously, the rate environment has changed quite dramatically over the last quarter. So I think we're in a stage where we are continuing obviously with the ABM repricing, but also being quite aggressive on deposit pricing, particularly term rollovers, et cetera. And so in essence, if you look at the euro balances, other currency balances on the slide, you'll see that's where most of the attrition is coming from, and that will continue for another quarter or so. I would expect, just, again, trying to land the strategically important relationship, even those who have euro balances, providing that they also do other business with us. But obviously, we can't activate those euro balances in the form of loans, and so they didn't need to be priced at market. In terms of what's left in that bucket, I would quantify it around $200 million to $300 million, most of it, again, ABN. We haven't really seen any -- we've seen great stability across the other platforms, and actually, in Cayman, we're a bit up in terms of deposit levels since year-end. So the rest of the bank is really fairly stable, but there is still a bit to go on the euro balances in the Channel Islands."

The treatment of TDRs is really an accounting question. So it really comes from the U.S. GAAP accounting side and not necessarily from prudential side. So we obviously take the guidance from FASB on that, which has sort of broadly stated that, as you know, the TDR is up to 6 months, providing the customer is in good standing, it shouldn't necessarily become a TDR or loan modification if it's a forbearance that's granted on that basis.

And then there's some activity fees when trust, restructure, et cetera, that we charge and/or enhanced tax reporting that we have to do under the common reporting standards or FABCO, et cetera. So those drive some activity-based fees, but they're not really related to an underlying market driver, if you will, it's more on a time spent basis again. So they're very capital efficient, very stable fees. And if you look over a period of -- since we went public, the only thing that's moved that fee number has been either acquisitions or sort of changes in underlying structures -- trust structures where the last beneficiaries passed away, et cetera. So those are very stable. 
Asset management, obviously, is impacted by underlying valuations. So we would expect those to be impacted and have been impacted, so you can see that over the quarters. Banking fees, in particular, is impacted through card services fees and merchant acquiring fees. So about 1/3 of the banking fees is in that bucket. And we would -- we've seen sort of leading indicators that seem to suggest maybe been an 80% drop in economic activity from debit card transactions, et cetera, during this period of stalled economic activity or government lockdowns that we've had in both Bermuda and Cayman, where you've got curfews and people have only been allowed to shop twice a week, et cetera. And that's just driven down, obviously -- not necessarily the number of transactions, but the value of the transactions so certainly in the short term, I would expect that to be impacted quite significantly. FX has actually been up due to the volatility in currency pairs, particularly the dollar sterling. We've seen a lot of fund activity in the Channel Islands, which had a record quarter in terms of FX. So it's more volatility-driven as opposed to -- obviously, it's all FX commissions, there's no proprietary positions in there. So it really will just depend on what happens in the FX markets. And the others are pretty small. Custody is pretty stable, it's a couple of basis points, as you would expect."

I appreciate some of the comments in the prepared remarks about the impact of lower interest rates on the net interest margin. I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving pieces, given a lot of the portfolio is floating rate, just what are some of the moving pieces in the portfolio? What are some of the actions that you've taken on the back of U.S. rate cuts? And are there any ameliorating factors that could kind of lessen the decline in your loan yields relative to what kind of U.S. benchmark rates have done?"

So I'll kick off, it's Michael Schrum. So yes, let's start with the March 18 actions that we took. So obviously, in Bermuda, we took resi down by 50 basis points with a 45-day lag. So you would expect to see 50 basis points on the floating part of that book, which is 80% of that book coming through in Q2. U.K., we've sort of more or less seen a 25 basis points reduction. Again, that's mostly a floating book. It does have a floor of 50 basis points on it. So we're not expecting any further compression on the U.K. book, but I would expect to see a full quarter following the Central Bank [indiscernible] in the U.K. as well. In Cayman, most of the book is floating. It's about 20% fixed. Again, between commercial and resi, we should expect the U.S. prime full impact of that, which will be around 100 basis points, obviously, a little bit into Q1, but most of it will come through in Q2. And then on the investment side or the non loan asset side, on cash, short-term securities, those are mostly repriced. You'll recall that we have a sort of -- we manage our own liquidity, and we have a sort of 3-month [indiscernible] ladder, which tends to be set ahead of any Fed funds, obviously. So we've seen most of the impact there, but it could be another 15 to 25 basis points on cash and short-term securities. 
On the investment portfolio, some of that will depend on reinvestment rates, but I would expect some premium amortization, and to some extent, will depend on the CPT as well, which could be -- it's anyone's guess really, but we haven't seen accelerated prepayments yet, but it could be 5 to 15 basis points, call it, 10 basis points on the investment portfolio over the next couple of quarters. And then offsetting that, obviously, we would expect a continued decline in the cost of deposits, not as much from demand because we're not yet charging negative rates on dollar deposits. But certainly on the term side, I would expect a further rollover benefit coming through the next couple of quarters. Most of that term money is really sitting in 3, 6 months, so it'll rollover into lower rates and probably generate an offset of about 10 to 15 basis points on the cost of deposits. 
So if you put all that together, over the next couple of quarters, you could see sort of a 25 to 35 basis point NIM compression. It will depend to some extent on loan demand in the market, both from what Michael spoke about in terms of government lending. It will also depend on where the 10-year is. Currently, reinvestment rates in the [ 1 50 ] range on MBS. And then obviously, the prepayment rates on MBS. So we're currently getting about $150 million to $200 million a quarter in maturities coming off that book. Again, if that obviously continues for a long period of time, that will start to impact investment yields more meaningfully. But at the moment, we obviously bought that book to protect against interest rate risk in the banking book. We have an unrealized position now of $150 million in there. That will certainly help comb through the coupons on the MBS securities over the next couple of years, and that was precisely why it's there in the first place."

And maybe on the expense side, the expense levels came in a lot lower than I think most people were expecting this quarter. I would have guessed that maybe given the delay in some of the integration in the Channel Islands that there may be -- the risk might be to the upside there, but it seems like you've taken some pretty good cost actions in the near term. I guess, can you just kind of walk us through near-term expectations on expenses? What sort of environmental impacts from the health crisis we might see on the expense line? What kind of cost cuts we could see? And then maybe any kind of tail impact of the integration of the Channel Islands deal in the third quarter, what impact that might have? I know that there's a lot of moving pieces there."

Obviously, travel has completely ceased as a corporate travel policy in mid-March. So that's one big expense item. When you operate these banks across multiple jurisdictions, obviously, there's a lot of travel, which is great. And obviously, client entertainment has also completely ceased at the moment or it's gone virtual at the moment, which obviously a lot less expensive. So we've seen a lot of benefit in the second part of March. And we would expect that to continue to come down in the discretionary bucket. But again, that will be a short-term benefit. Coming out of lockdown, obviously, we'll start to gear up again. We are a relationship bank. And so it's important to -- for us to stay in touch with our customers, not just virtually, but also to spend time with them and understand what their business plans are, et cetera. On the more strategic side, obviously, we've taken action and deferred some of the capital spending programs, particularly around buildings, around brand rollout, resequenced that into a much slower burn rate at this point. We think we'd still obtain substantially the same benefits, but over a longer period of time. So people are not automatically getting new business cards, they're using the existing ones. We're not replacing the whole pins on the credit and debit cards, we're doing that gradually as cards expire, et cetera. We're -- we keep investing in the front line side of the business. So the branch refurb in Bermuda will still go ahead, which I think will be great. But some of the back office capital programs have been put on hold or are being reevaluated, as you would expect. 
Finally, I think amortization, as we talked about in the past as well, Butterfield built a very expensive system about 10 years ago, $120 million, which is -- the amortization is running off at the end of this quarter. And so moving into Q4, we would expect that to start helping. Effectively, that's $10 million annualized cost saving a year, of which we will put $2 million to $3 million back in, I expect, as part of normal system upgrades, et cetera, so net a $7 million there. And then obviously, depending on how long this goes on for, we'll need to look again more on a 0 basis -- or zero-based budgeting basis about -- I think it's been a bit of a reset for us. How many people do we need in the buildings, what do we really need to operate this business, et cetera. And so I'll just set Michael tune in on that."

So I think -- I mean, our focus, obviously, right now, the next quarter or 2 is just making sure everyone is safe and operating well and being supported. So lots of communication. I would say it's remarkable how we've been able to operate working remotely, which is a really interesting part of the model today. So today, across our 1,500 employees, we mentioned 70% are working remotely, 15% are at home not working, 15% are in the office. So if you could just take Bermuda as an example, we're operating full retail services where -- the operations with 59 people in the office out of about 500 and it's similar ratios across the different jurisdictions. So I think we are stepping back, and we're thinking about what the model should be and what the cost structure should be, assuming that we're going to be in a 0 interest rate environment for the long term. And so I think that has implications for a bank like Butterfield, it's deposit led, and we understand that. So we're focused on what could the model look like as we come out of the pandemic. 
We have to be a little bit careful because while we're working remotely and things are operating very well, few client complaints at all, we have to recognize that volumes are way down as well. So we've got to sort of back test that to see how we could operate. But I think it is a real indication of a new working model that -- for a bank like Butterfield in very expensive jurisdictions, multiple currencies, multiple regulators. We are a pretty complex bank, and I think we're just going to do the work over the next quarter to see what a potential new cost structure model could look like. But first and foremost, the focus right now is, yes, do the work in the background, but at this point, we're here to support our employees as they service our client base."

And what Butterfield did in the past in terms of lending and our entire model has been focused on just in-market lending, no out-of-market lending, no credit exposure in the investment portfolio. So that's really positioned us quite well. That's not to say we won't have some residential mortgage issues here as the economies will start to open up, but from a broader perspective, repositioning ourselves from a credit perspective for this sort of event. So I think we feel pretty confident on that side. And I think you're right. It's a little -- obviously, right now, given the environment, no one's really doing much of anything in terms of necessarily near-term corporate development. But I think we do really believe that things will open up as markets start to operate again. And as we said, we're a decent-sized bank in Guernsey at this point, so 10%, 15% market share; 1% or 2%, Jersey. We do think there's still going to be some opportunities there as U.K. banks start to strategically reposition. And in Singapore, which is more or less shut down right now, but luckily, it's a trust company as opposed to a bank, is still a great market for us, and we just really need to find some scale. So we do think there's going to be opportunities. But I would temper just by saying in the next few months, people are just trying to get through the situation they're in. But I think going into the summer, things -- discussions may open up at that point. But to your point, we are -- have a really healthy balance sheet, and we're strategically positioned to execute the strategy we've been talking about for years."

I think people are pretty nervous. We actually are seeing some more interest in our jurisdictions from an estate planning perspective. Again, it's driven by a handful of lawyers in New York, London to Miami. So we're seeing actually some really good inward connections in terms of possibly new trust. I think existing trust, it's -- I think really people focusing on making sure that the structures make sense, that the beneficiaries are right, that sort of thing. So it's sort of the day-to-day stuff we do anyway, but probably enhanced today. Yes, you could see some deposit weakness. So we have some very large stressed clients. And I think as -- not so much pulling money out necessarily to sort of put in a box somewhere, it's really -- I think people are seeing real investment opportunities.

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum for additional details on COVID-19 from a credit perspective and comments on the first quarter results. 
Turning now to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. We reported net income of $40.3 million or $0.77 per share and core net income of $40.8 million and $0.78 per share. In the first quarter, net income was 8% lower than the previous quarter due to seasonal fee income and a $5.2 million CECL reserve build for future expected credit losses. Our core return on average tangible common equity was 18.6%, down from 21.1% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 2.63% compared to the last quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 8 basis points to 42 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 5. As we operate across small Island communities, Butterfield has an important role to play as an essential service provider, a domestic systemically important bank, an employer, a source of working capital for companies in need and an active corporate supporting our communities. We have a particularly strong sense of responsibility to balance the needs of all stakeholders during this time. The COVID-19 virus is evident in and impacting all of our operating jurisdictions. The number of infections and deaths in our various locations have been consistent with the statistics we're seeing globally. For Bermuda, there have been over 100 cases identified and sadly, 6 deaths. Cayman Islands have identified over 70 cases with 1 known death. And between Guernsey and Jersey, there have been hundreds of confirmed cases with known death as well. At this point, we only have 1 confirmed employee case in our Swiss office, who is expected to make a full recovery. We would like to express our deepest sympathies to anyone who has been directly affected or lost a loved one to the virus. We remain hopeful that the current shelter in place and social distancing practices will continue to slow the spread of the virus so that local economies and tourism can start to recover. 
When the severity of the crisis and health implications became known, the bank's initial focus was on the well-being of our customers and employees, including our ability to continue providing essential banking services. We quickly began mandating social distancing, providing protective equipment for staff, implementing split team and building strategies and establishing broad remote working conditions through our virtual desktop interface. We have remained operational as permitted, with just over 70% of employees working from home and providing all necessary equipment and services to support our employees and customers. 
To help ease the financial impact on the communities, we have temporarily deferred residential mortgage payments, reduced fees and increased our direct contributions to urgent care programs supporting the most vulnerable people. In the short term, we are working with clients to assess their needs and provide support. In Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is an important contributor to local activity as well as exports, we are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining frequent engagement with clients. In our estimation, the duration of the temporary shelter-in-place lockdown conditions is one of the most critical factors which will determine the return of economic activity and ultimately, the future impact on Butterfield. 
The bank keeps a significant source of liquidity available, primarily $3 billion of cash and short-term securities as well as $4.5 billion of U.S. agency MBS. Together, this represents just under 2/3 of all customer deposits. The current interest rate environment will impact our interest earnings from short-term securities as well as our variable rate loans and while lower deposit rates are unlikely to entirely offset the lost interest income. We also are seeing significantly decreased card services fees with no tourism and subdued domestic economic activity. 
Over the coming periods, we may also see increased prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio as U.S. home borrowers seek to refinance home loans in a lower interest rate environment. As we think about the medium and longer-term implications in the 3- to 5-year time frames, a sustained long-term ultralow interest rate environment could likely erode profitability over time. The bank has historically benefited from lower-cost deposit funding. However, in an ultralow interest rate environment, the value of those deposits reduces significantly and lower agency reinvestment rates would combine to compress NIM. This could ultimately alter earnings profile of the bank and would result in increased reliance on fee businesses. If interest rates fall further to negative rates, we could be in a position to charge negative interest rates on deposits, as we have witnessed in Europe. We would also need to become more efficient through accelerated cost reductions. 
On the capital side, we are pleased to continue at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.44 per share, which represents a strong yield at recent share prices and remain active on share repurchases. We continue to believe the dividend rate is sustainable and continues to be a capital management priority. It is possible that M&A opportunities could become available as larger onshore financial institutions with banking and trust operations in our current operating jurisdictions may decide to focus on their core businesses and may want to sell less strategically important assets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide additional information on the bank's credit portfolio and potential COVID-exposed areas and then add some additional details regarding the first quarter results, including a discussion on the bank's capital position and management."

Before I give an overview of the first quarter results, I wanted to provide some information on some specific credit exposures. As you can see on the bottom left of Slide 5, we have fairly limited direct credit exposure to hotel and restaurant lending sectors, which is primarily in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Hotel operators and construction loans represent our biggest direct commercial COVID-related credit risk. However, given the structure of the deals, generally at below 50% pre-crisis LTVs and the underlying financial strength of the borrowers, we are not currently expecting significant losses from this area. If the crisis lingers several more quarters, one of the emerging areas where customers could start to see challenges may be in the part of the residential book with borrowers who currently work in tourism-related businesses. Finally, we do not have any direct exposure to the oil exploration or production sector. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and some details regarding the first quarter results. On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the first quarter, NIM of 2.63% increased 4 basis points as the cost of deposits, particularly home deposits, decreased from rollovers, which more than offset the decrease in interest income. Lower rates were partially passed along to borrowers, with yields on variable rate loans being 15 basis points lower in the quarter. Average loans increased during the first quarter as we had the benefit of a full quarter of lending to the Bermuda and Cayman governments, which were drawn late in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. Deposits at March 31, 2020, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 5.5% from the end of the year. The decrease is the result of the expected attrition of euro balances in the Channel Islands, which is consistent with previous guidance on the ABN deal. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 8 basis points due to lower term deposit pricing on rollovers. It is also worth noting that during the '08, '09 financial crisis, overall customer deposit levels did not reduce significantly, and at this point, we continue to see stability in deposit levels. 
Looking now at Slide 9. Noninterest income was down 4.3% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower card services fees, which were negatively impacted by reduced volumes as economic activity stalled in March due to government lockdowns. 
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense. As we discussed last quarter, first quarter expenses returned to the expected range after being elevated in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to reduced headcount in the Channel Islands, lower marketing expenses, travel expenses and client event costs. We continue to target a true cycle efficiency ratio of 60%. 
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues with our conservative capital management philosophy that balances regulatory requirements with shareholder returns. Tangible book value per share increased 4.6% in the first quarter due to contributions from earnings and OCI related to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We continue to view the dividend as the most direct and efficient way to translate the high ROE of the business to investor return. The dividend coverage ratio remains around 2x, and we believe the current dividend rate is sustainable. Our capital management priorities have not changed and continue to support the dividend, organic loan growth, share repurchases in appropriate market conditions and maintaining flexibility to pursue M&A deals when the right opportunities arise. 
Turning now to Slide 12. During the first quarter, the balance sheet was broadly stable, except for the continued decline in the euro-denominated deposits in the Channel Islands, as expected. End-of-period loan balances were down almost 3% due to the lower dollar value of pound sterling-denominated loans in the Channel Islands and the U.K. With the significant fall in U.S. interest rates, total net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio were $155 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $61 million at the year-end. 
On Slide 13, we continue to emphasize low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with the majority of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Loans are mostly residential and full recourse with 75% of the portfolio in the below 70% LTV bucket. In light of COVID-19 and its potential future impact on particularly unsecured loans, we have increased our reserve estimate by $5.2 million, and the total reserve under CECL is now 72 basis points of gross loans, reflective of the collateral-backed residential lending platforms built over the last decade. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. The structural asset sensitivity of the balance sheet has now been entirely realized by the reduction in front-end rates. Therefore, the downside 100 basis points scenario would start to increase NII if the bank passes negative rates on to customers by increasing spread on demand deposits. The assumption on negative U.S. dollar deposit rates would be similar to what we've seen in Europe. In the upside 100 basis point scenario, the bank starts to increase net interest income with a positive differential between deposit and market rates. Additionally, reinvestment rates would improve, thereby improving net interest income also. 
I'll now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Butterfield's integration in the Channel Island is progressing well and into its final stages. We now expect the full operational integration to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 as most clients are also working remotely, and it is practically much safer to upgrade their banking systems once customers are back in their offices sometimes in the second quarter of 2020. 
Following the success of the Channel Islands, we remain committed to exploring potential acquisitions in banking and trust, with most opportunities in the Channel Islands for banking and trust. For the trust network, we would also seek to build on the potential in Asia with a larger trust presence in Singapore. While we do not have any specific communications on this at the moment, these discussions are still continuing. 
The effect of this health crisis on Butterfield will depend on uncertain factors, including the length and depth of the pandemic and associated government lockdowns, how that impacts domestic economic activity and tourism, how quickly can these recover as well as the interest rate environment. Our communications with the regulators, rating agencies and governments remain constructive and supportive. 
The bank continues to have a strong and flexible capital position with a very liquid balance sheet. Learning from the financial crisis a decade ago, Butterfield's credit underwriting has been conservative, and as a result, our exposure to potentially problematic sectors is limited and should place the bank in a strong position to emerge from the current crisis. 
As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity again to thank our employees, particularly those in the front line and retail branches, continuing to welcome customers and helping them and us through a difficult period. Thank you. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model. We don't use a third-party service provider to provide data as all of our loans are primarily manually underwritten. And so we use part of our own history -- repayment history, obviously, and local market conditions and where we operate. We do use, of course, external data in the model, including primarily unemployment forecasts as well as GDP forecasts. And for that, we use a combination of service providers, including Moody's and Bloomberg. 
The underlying assumptions for the model going in to this year, obviously, changed a lot since the end of the year, which is driving the additional reserve build in this quarter. So overall, we've landed on a negative 3 GDP -- U.S. GDP forecast for this year, which is one of the central assumptions. Obviously, that has a big shock in the second quarter to economic activity of double digits and then sort of a -- more of a U-shaped recovery into Q4. Again, the model is somewhat sensitive, obviously, to the external variables. But I would say, because most of the loan book is residential and manually underwritten, we have more of a straight line to realizing collateral in a troubled situation. So it mostly impacts the loan buckets that are -- where debt service coverage is really cash flow-based, so that would be the sort of C&I book and a credit card book. But again, those are relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So hopefully, that helps a bit."

On the commercial side, we're working with all of our commercial customers, daily trying to find out how they're doing and figuring out where we can help. So that's obviously very specific discussions individually as opposed to any broader program. We're going to look at it in 3 months on the residential side, see where we are. There is some chance we could extend it for an additional period. But obviously, everything's so fluid right now. We're just going to wait and see.

I mean, interestingly, restaurants are about $7 million, which is obviously really contained. In terms of the hotel book, we have a couple of big hotel loans that are currently in operation, 2 or 3. We think they're well underwritten. And they have sort of broader context. So one of them, as an example, has a large condominium project that's been running for years associated with it. So a big part of our repayment actually comes from expats in these condos as opposed to the hotel itself. One of the other operating loans is a wealthy relationship that we have a far broader deeper relationship and have real clear a lot of sight in terms of the family's wealth. So it's a hotel, it's secured by hotel, but it's really a much, much broader relationship than that. 
And then on the hotel construction, you hit it on the head. I mean we have the St. George's hotel that's really being built and is well on its way. We'll -- plan is to open up next year, which is hopefully not too bad timing given the fact it will be summer next year. We'll have some time to see how this all plays out. And on that loan, the Bermuda government has guaranteed $25 million out of our $60 million commitment. And lots of equity, lots of equity upfront, completely different underwriting than the bank did pre-financial crisis. So we feel pretty comfortable about both the total size relative to our total credit portfolio and also the individual credits within it. So we think it's pretty contained."

Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%. That's actually a Chamber of Commerce projection as opposed to government. Guernsey is minus 15% and Jersey is minus 6%. Well, I -- it's -- everyone's sort of just trying to figure out where it's going. Obviously, Cayman has a bit more tourism exposure, so there, 25% of GDP is tourism, while Bermuda is only 17%, and the Channel Islands is very little. Jersey's got some. So I'd say it's fair to say it's going to be double-digit declines in 2020, maybe lower to mid double-digit. But obviously, this is uncharted territory, so let's just see how that goes. 
In Bermuda, there's been a few small stimulus steps so far. So really small, just a sort of a $12 million small business government-guaranteed program. Bermuda set up unemployment insurance for the first time and has put out close to $20 million. A few thousand people are getting unemployment, weekly checks, processed through banks, direct credit for the first time ever. So that's really stimulus. I think the Ministry of Finance will come out in the near term and come up with a broader program. But at this point, Bermuda hasn't really stated exactly what the broader stimulus is going to be. But we do know that there's going to be some more borrowing in Bermuda to support it. Cayman has a surplus, has some reserves that they can use. They're talking about potentially borrowing a few hundred million in Guernsey and Jersey as well. So they're all in different stages of thinking about using their reserves in the other 3 islands and figuring out what sort of amount they want to borrow. And I'd say it's -- sort of 10% of GDP is pretty much across the board, so a few hundred million, maybe up to $500 million. And we want to be as helpful as possible in all our jurisdictions from a credit perspective. We know these economies better than anybody, so it's a good time to be able to support the governments. So mixed stimulus. It's sort of evolving. The U.K., obviously, is in a different situation, much broader programs. But I think the islands actually are going to be somewhat contained in terms of throwing money at it. So that's sort of where it is."

And obviously, the rate environment has changed quite dramatically over the last quarter. So I think we're in a stage where we are continuing obviously with the ABM repricing, but also being quite aggressive on deposit pricing, particularly term rollovers, et cetera. And so in essence, if you look at the euro balances, other currency balances on the slide, you'll see that's where most of the attrition is coming from, and that will continue for another quarter or so. I would expect, just, again, trying to land the strategically important relationship, even those who have euro balances, providing that they also do other business with us. But obviously, we can't activate those euro balances in the form of loans, and so they didn't need to be priced at market. In terms of what's left in that bucket, I would quantify it around $200 million to $300 million, most of it, again, ABN. We haven't really seen any -- we've seen great stability across the other platforms, and actually, in Cayman, we're a bit up in terms of deposit levels since year-end. So the rest of the bank is really fairly stable, but there is still a bit to go on the euro balances in the Channel Islands."

The treatment of TDRs is really an accounting question. So it really comes from the U.S. GAAP accounting side and not necessarily from prudential side. So we obviously take the guidance from FASB on that, which has sort of broadly stated that, as you know, the TDR is up to 6 months, providing the customers good standing, it shouldn't necessarily become a TDR or loan modification if it's a forbearance that's granted on that basis.

It's been hovering around 200 for the last 5 to 7 years, and that's partially because Bermuda still has a lot of indigenous wealth that's on the island. And so when property prices fall, families just hold on to it as opposed to try to recoup some equity. So it just slows down basically. But I think, as we said, we don't have a lot of exposure on the tourism side. We -- directly, but we do, obviously, indirectly through mortgages, and we're going to have to watch that very carefully."

I can certainly confirm all the trust fees are being billed on as part of an annual fee. And then there's some activity fees when trust, restructure, et cetera, that we charge and/or enhanced tax reporting that we have to do under the common reporting standards or FATCA, et cetera. So those drive some activity-based fees, but they're not really related to an underlying market driver, if you will, it's more on a time spent basis. Again, so they're very capital efficient, very stable fees. And if you look over a period of -- since we went public, the only thing that's moved that fee number has been either acquisitions or sort of changes in underlying structures -- trust structures where the last beneficiaries passed away, et cetera. So those are very stable. 
Asset management, obviously, is impacted by underlying valuations. So we would expect those to be impacted and have been impacted, so you can see that over the quarters. Banking fees, in particular, is impacted through card services fees and merchant acquiring fees. So about 1/3 of the banking fees is in that bucket. And we would -- we've seen sort of leading indicators that seem to suggest maybe been an 80% drop in economic activity from debit card transactions, et cetera, during this period of stalled economic activity or government lockdowns that we've had in both Bermuda and Cayman, where you've got curfews and people have only been allowed to shop twice a week, et cetera. And that's just driven down, obviously -- not necessarily the number of transactions, but the value of the transactions so certainly in the short term, I would expect that to be impacted quite significantly. FX has actually been up due to the volatility in currency pairs, particularly the dollar sterling. We've seen a lot of fund activity in the Channel Islands, which had a record quarter in terms of FX. So it's more volatility-driven as opposed to -- obviously, it's total FX commissions, there's no proprietary positions in there. So it really will just depend on what happens in the FX markets. And the others are pretty small. Custody is pretty stable, it's a couple of basis points, as you would expect."

What are some of the actions that you've taken on the back of U.S. rate cuts? And are there any ameliorating factors that could kind of lessen the decline in your loan yields relative to what kind of U.S. benchmark rates have done?"

So I'll kick off, it's Michael Schrum. So yes, let's start with the March 18 actions that we took. So obviously, in Bermuda, we took resi down by 50 basis points with a 45-day lag. So you would expect to see 50 basis points on the floating part of that book, which is 80% of that book coming through in Q2. U.K., we've sort of more or less seen a 25 basis points reduction. Again, that's mostly a floating book. It does have a floor of 50 basis points on it. So we're not expecting any further compression on the U.K. book, but I would expect to see a full quarter following the Central Bank [indiscernible] in the U.K. as well. In Cayman, most of the book is floating. It's about 20% fixed. Again, between commercial and resi, we should expect the U.S. prime full impact of that, which will be around 100 basis points, obviously, a little bit into Q1, but most of it will come through in Q2. And then on the investment side or the non-loan asset side, on cash, short-term securities, those are mostly repriced. You'll recall that we have a sort of -- we manage our own liquidity, and we have a sort of 3-month T-Bill ladder, which tends to be set ahead of any Fed funds, obviously. So we've seen most of the impact there, but it could be another 15 to 25 basis points on cash and short-term securities. 
On the investment portfolio, some of that will depend on reinvestment rates, but I would expect some premium amortization, and to some extent, will depend on the CPT as well, which could be -- it's anyone's guess really, but we haven't seen accelerated prepayments yet, but it could be 5 to 15 basis points, call it, 10 basis points on the investment portfolio over the next couple of quarters. And then offsetting that, obviously, we would expect a continued decline in the cost of deposits, not as much from demand because we're not yet charging negative rates on dollar deposits. But certainly on the term side, I would expect a further rollover benefit coming through the next couple of quarters. Most of that term money is really sitting in 3, 6 months, so it'll rollover into lower rates and probably generate an offset of about 10 to 15 basis points on the cost of deposits. 
So if you put all that together, over the next couple of quarters, you could see sort of a 25 to 35 basis point NIM compression. It will depend to some extent on loan demand in the market, both from what Michael spoke about in terms of government lending. It will also depend on where the 10-year is. Currently, reinvestment rates in the $150 million range on MBS. And then obviously, the prepayment rates on MBS. So we're currently getting about $150 million to $200 million a quarter in maturities coming off that book. Again, if that obviously continues for a long period of time that will start to impact investment yields more meaningfully. But at the moment, we obviously bought that book to protect against interest rate risk in the banking book. We have an unrealized position now of $150 million in there. That will certainly help come through the coupons on the MBS securities over the next couple of years, and that was precisely why it's there in the first place."

And maybe on the expense side, the expense levels came in a lot lower than I think most people were expecting this quarter. I would have guessed that maybe given the delay in some of the integration in the Channel Islands that there may be -- the risk might be to the upside there, but it seems like you've taken some pretty good cost actions in the near term. I guess, can you just kind of walk us through near-term expectations on expenses? What sort of environmental impacts from the health crisis we might see on the expense line? What kind of cost cuts we could see? And then maybe any kind of tail impact of the integration of the Channel Islands deal in the third quarter, what impact that might have?

Obviously, travel's completely ceased as a corporate travel policy in mid-March. So that's one big expense item. When you operate these banks across multiple jurisdictions, obviously, there's a lot of travel, which is great. And obviously, client entertainment has also completely ceased at the moment or it's gone virtual at the moment, which obviously a lot less expensive. So we've seen a lot of benefit in the second part of March. And we would expect that to continue to come down in the discretionary bucket. But again, that will be a short-term benefit. Coming out of lockdown, obviously, we'll start to gear up again. We are a relationship bank. And so it's important to -- for us to stay in touch with our customers, not just virtually, but also to spend time with them and understand what their business plans are, et cetera. 
On the more strategic side, obviously, we've taken action and deferred some of the capital spending programs, particularly around buildings, around brand rollout, resequenced that into a much slower burn rate at this point. We think we'd still obtain substantially the same benefits, but over a longer period of time. So people are not automatically getting new business cards, they're using the existing ones. We're not replacing the whole bins on the credit and debit cards, we're doing that gradually as cards expire, et cetera. We're -- we keep investing in the front line side of the business. So the branch refurb in Bermuda will still go ahead, which I think will be great. But some of the back office capital programs have been put on hold or are being reevaluated, as you would expect. 
Finally, I think amortization, as we talked about in the past as well, Butterfield built a very expensive system about 10 years ago, $120 million, which is -- the amortization is running off at the end of this quarter. And so moving into Q4, we would expect that to start helping. Effectively, that's $10 million annualized cost saving a year, of which we will put $2 million to $3 million back in, I expect, as part of normal system upgrades, et cetera, so net a $7 million there. And then obviously, depending on how long this goes on for, we'll need to look again more on a 0 basis -- or zero-based budgeting basis about -- I think it's been a bit of a reset for us. How many people do we need in the buildings, what do we really need to operate this business, et cetera. And so I'll just set Michael tune in on that."

So I think -- I mean, our focus, obviously, right now, the next quarter or 2 is just making sure everyone is safe and operating well and being supported. So lots of communication. I would say it's remarkable how we've been able to operate working remotely, which is a really interesting part of the model today. So today, across our 1,500 employees, we mentioned 70% are working remotely, 15% are at home not working, 15% are in the office. So if you could just take Bermuda as an example, we're operating full retail services where  the operations with 59 people in the office out of about 500 and it's similar ratios across the different jurisdictions. So I think we are stepping back, and we're thinking about what the model should be and what the cost structure should be, assuming that we're going to be in a 0 interest rate environment for the long term. And so I think that has implications for a bank like Butterfield, it's deposit led, and we understand that. So we're focused on what could the model look like as we come out of the pandemic. 
We have to be a little bit careful because while we're working remotely and things are operating very well, few client complaints at all, we have to recognize that volumes are way down as well. So we've got to sort of back test that to see how we could operate. But I think it is a real indication of a new working model that for a bank like Butterfield in very expensive jurisdictions, multiple currencies, multiple regulators. We are a pretty complex bank, and I think we're just going to do the work over the next quarter to see what a potential new cost structure model could look like. But first and foremost, the focus right now is, yes, do the work in the background, but at this point, we're here to support our employees as they service our client base."

That's not to say we won't have some residential mortgage issues here as the economies will start to open up, but from a broader perspective, repositioning ourselves from a credit perspective for this sort of event. So I think we feel pretty confident on that side. And I think you're right. It's a little -- obviously, right now, given the environment, no one's really doing much of anything in terms of necessarily near-term corporate development. But I think we do really believe that things will open up as markets start to operate again. And as we said, we're a decent-sized bank in Guernsey at this point, so 10%, 15% market share; 1% or 2%, Jersey. We do think there's still going to be some opportunities there as U.K. banks start to strategically reposition. And in Singapore, which is more or less shut down right now, but luckily, it's a trust company as opposed to a bank, is still a great market for us, and we just really need to find some scale. So we do think there's going to be opportunities. But I would temper just by saying in the next few months, people are just trying to get through the situation they're in. But I think going into the summer, things -- discussions may open up at that point. But to your point, we are -- have a really healthy balance sheet, and we're strategically positioned to execute the strategy we've been talking about for years."

On the call, I am joined by Butterfield's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Collins; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Schrum. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session. 
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter results. Press release, along with a slide presentation that we will refer to during our remarks on this call, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.butterfieldgroup.com. 
Before I turn the call over to Michael Collins, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For a reconciliation of these measures to U.S. GAAP, please refer to the earnings press release and slide presentation. 
Today's call and associated materials may also contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.

While we are pleased with the bank's results in the first quarter, our current focus is on addressing the new realities developing from the COVID-19 health crisis. 
I will begin today's discussion with a quick review of the highlights from the first quarter and then provide an update regarding the bank's COVID-19-related actions and potential exposures. I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum for additional details on COVID-19 from a credit perspective and comments on the first quarter results. 
Turning now to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. We reported net income of $40.3 million or $0.77 per share and core net income of $40.8 million and $0.78 per share. In the first quarter, net income was 8% lower than the previous quarter due to seasonal fee income and a $5.2 million CECL reserve build for future expected credit losses. Our core return on average tangible common equity was 18.6%, down from 21.1% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 2.63% compared to the last quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 8 basis points to 42 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 5. As we operate across small island communities, Butterfield has an important role to play as an essential service provider, a domestic systemically important bank, an employer, a source of working capital for companies in need and an active corporate citizen supporting our communities. We have a particularly strong sense of responsibility to balance the needs of all stakeholders during this time. The COVID-19 virus is evident in and impacting all of our operated jurisdictions. The number of infections and deaths in our various locations have been consistent with the statistics we're seeing globally. For Bermuda, there have been over 100 cases identified and sadly, 6 deaths. Cayman Islands have identified over 70 cases with 1 known death. And between Guernsey and Jersey, there have been hundreds of confirmed cases with known death as well. At this point, we only have 1 confirmed employee case in our Swiss office, who is expected to make a full recovery. We would like to express our deepest sympathies to anyone who has been directly affected or lost a loved one to the virus. We remain hopeful that the current shelter-in-place and social distancing practices will continue to slow the spread of the virus so that local economies and tourism can start to recover. 
When the severity of the crisis and health implications became known, the bank's initial focus was on the well-being of our customers and employees, including our ability to continue providing essential banking services. We quickly began mandating social distancing, providing protective equipment for staff, implementing split team and building strategies and establishing broad remote working conditions through our virtual desktop interface. We have remained operational as permitted, with just over 70% of employees working from home and providing all necessary equipment and services to support our employees and customers. 
To help ease the financial impact on the communities, we have temporarily deferred residential mortgage payments, reduced fees and increased our direct contributions to urgent care programs supporting the most vulnerable people. In the short term, we are working with clients to assess their needs and provide support. In Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is an important contributor to local activity as well as exports, we are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining frequent engagement with clients. In our estimation, the duration of the temporary shelter-in-place lockdown conditions is one of the most critical factors which will determine the return of economic activity and ultimately, the future impact on Butterfield. 
The bank keeps a significant source of liquidity available, primarily $3 billion of cash and short-term securities as well as $4.5 billion of U.S. agency MBS. Together, this represents just under 2/3 of all customer deposits. The current interest rate environment will impact our interest earnings from short-term securities as well as our variable rate loans, while lower deposit rates are unlikely to entirely offset the lost interest income. We also are seeing significantly decreased card services fees with no tourism and subdued domestic economic activity. 
Over the coming periods, we may also see increased prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio as U.S. home borrowers seek to refinance home loans in a lower interest rate environment. As we think about the medium and longer-term implications in the 3- to 5-year time frames, a sustained long-term ultralow interest rate environment could likely erode profitability over time. The bank has historically benefited from lower-cost deposit funding. However, in an ultralow interest rate environment, the value of those deposits reduces significantly and lower agency reinvestment rates would combine to compress NIM. This could ultimately alter the earnings profile of the bank and would result in increased reliance on fee businesses. If interest rates fall further to negative rates, we could be in a position to charge negative interest rates on deposits, as we have witnessed in Europe. We would also need to become more efficient through accelerated cost reductions. 
On the capital side, we are pleased to continue at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.44 per share, which represents a strong yield at recent share prices and remain active on share repurchases. We continue to believe the dividend rate is sustainable and continues to be a capital management priority. It is possible that M&A opportunities could become available as larger onshore financial institutions with banking and trust operations in our current operating jurisdictions may decide to focus on their core businesses and may want to sell less strategically important assets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide additional information on the bank's credit portfolio in potential COVID-exposed areas and then add some additional details regarding the first quarter results, including a discussion on the bank's capital position and management."

Before I give an overview of the first quarter results, I wanted to provide some information on some specific credit exposures. As you can see on the bottom left of Slide 5, we have fairly limited direct credit exposure to hotel and restaurant lending sectors, which is primarily in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Hotel operators and construction loans represent our biggest direct commercial COVID-related credit risk. However, given the structure of the deals, generally at below 50% pre-crisis LTVs and the underlying financial strength of the borrowers, we are not currently expecting significant losses from this area. If the crisis lingers several more quarters, one of the emerging areas where customers could start to see challenges may be in the part of the residential book with borrowers who currently work in tourism-related businesses. Finally, we do not have any direct exposure to the oil exploration or production sector. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and some details regarding the first quarter results. On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the first quarter, NIM of 2.63% increased 4 basis points as the cost of deposits, particularly term deposits, decreased from rollovers, which more than offset the decrease in interest income. Lower rates were partially passed along to borrowers, with yields on variable rate loans being 15 basis points lower in the quarter. Average loans increased during the first quarter as we had the benefit of a full quarter of lending to the Bermuda and Cayman governments, which were drawn late in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. Deposits at March 31, 2020, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 5.5% from the end of the year. The decrease is the result of the expected attrition of euro balances in the Channel Islands, which is consistent with previous guidance on the ABN deal. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 8 basis points due to lower term deposit pricing on rollovers. It is also worth noting that during the '08-'09 financial crisis, overall customer deposit levels did not reduce significantly, and at this point, we continue to see stability in deposit levels. 
Looking now at Slide 9. Noninterest income was down 4.3% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower card services fees, which were negatively impacted by reduced volumes as economic activity stalled in March due to government lockdowns. 
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense. As we discussed last quarter, first quarter expenses returned to the expected range after being elevated in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to reduced headcount in the Channel Islands, lower marketing expenses, travel expenses and client event costs. We continue to target a through cycle efficiency ratio of 60%. 
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues with our conservative capital management philosophy that balances regulatory requirements with shareholder returns. Tangible book value per share increased 4.6% in the first quarter due to contributions from earnings and OCI related to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We continue to view the dividend as the most direct and efficient way to translate the high ROE of the business to investor return. The dividend coverage ratio remains around 2x, and we believe the current dividend rate is sustainable. Our capital management priorities have not changed and continue to support the dividend, organic loan growth, share repurchases in appropriate market conditions and maintaining flexibility to pursue M&A deals when the right opportunities arise. 
Turning now to Slide 12. During the first quarter, the balance sheet was broadly stable, except for the continued decline in the euro-denominated deposits in the Channel Islands, as expected. End-of-period loan balances were down almost 3% due to the lower dollar value of pound sterling-denominated loans in the Channel Islands and the U.K. With the significant fall in U.S. interest rates, total net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio were $155 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $61 million at the year-end. 
On Slide 13, we continue to emphasize low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with the majority of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Loans are mostly residential and full recourse with 75% of the portfolio in the below 70% LTV bucket. In light of COVID-19 and its potential future impact on particularly unsecured loans, we have increased our reserve estimate by $5.2 million, and the total reserve under CECL is now 72 basis points of gross loans, reflective of the collateral-backed residential lending platforms built over the last decade. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. The structural asset sensitivity of the balance sheet has now been entirely realized by the reduction in front-end rates. Therefore, the downside 100 basis points scenario would start to increase NII if the bank passes negative rates on to customers by increasing spread on demand deposits. The assumption on negative U.S. dollar deposit rates would be similar to what we've seen in Europe. In the upside 100 basis point scenario, the bank starts to increase net interest income with a positive differential between deposit and market rates. Additionally, reinvestment rates would improve, thereby improving net interest income also. 
I'll now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Butterfield's integration in the Channel Island is progressing well and into its final stages. We now expect the full operational integration to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 as most clients are also working remotely, and it is practically much safer to upgrade their banking systems once customers are back in their offices sometimes in the second quarter of 2020. 
Following the success of the Channel Islands, we remain committed to exploring potential acquisitions in banking and trust, with most opportunities in the Channel Islands for banking and trust. For the trust network, we would also seek to build on the potential in Asia with a larger trust presence in Singapore. While we do not have any specific communications on this at the moment, these discussions are still continuing. 
The effect of this health crisis on Butterfield will depend on uncertain factors, including the length and depth of the pandemic and associated government lockdowns, how that impacts domestic economic activity and tourism, how quickly can these recover as well as the interest rate environment. Our communications with the regulators, rating agencies and governments remain constructive and supportive. 
The bank continues to have a strong and flexible capital position with a very liquid balance sheet. Learning from the financial crisis a decade ago, Butterfield's credit underwriting has been conservative, and as a result, our exposure to potentially problematic sectors is limited and should place the bank in a strong position to emerge from the current crisis. 
As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity again to thank our employees, particularly those in the front line and retail branches, continuing to welcome customers and helping them and us through a difficult period. Thank you. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model. We don't use a third-party service provider to provide data as all of our loans are primarily manually underwritten. And so we use part of our own history -- repayment history, obviously, and local market conditions and where we operate. We do use, of course, external data in the model, including primarily unemployment forecasts as well as GDP forecasts. And for that, we use a combination of service providers, including Moody's and Bloomberg. 
The underlying assumptions for the model going in to this year, obviously, changed a lot since the end of the year, which is driving the additional reserve build in this quarter. So overall, we've landed on a negative 3 GDP -- U.S. GDP forecast for this year, which is one of the central assumptions. Obviously, that has a big shock in the second quarter to economic activity of double digits and then sort of a -- more of a U-shaped recovery into Q4. Again, the model is somewhat sensitive, obviously, to the external variables. But I would say, because most of the loan book is residential and manually underwritten, we have more of a straight line to realizing collateral in a troubled situation. So it mostly impacts the loan buckets that are -- where debt service coverage is really cash flow-based, so that would be the sort of C&I book and the credit card book. But again, those are relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So hopefully, that helps a bit."

And we are getting some of that where people don't want to stretch the term of the mortgage, but it's pretty much across the residential book. 
On the commercial side, we're working with all of our commercial customers daily, trying to find out how they're doing and figuring out where we can help. So that's obviously very specific discussions individually as opposed to any broader program. We're going to look at it in 3 months on the residential side, see where we are. There is some chance we could extend it for an additional period. But obviously, everything's so fluid right now. We're just going to wait and see.

I mean, interestingly, restaurants are about $7 million, which is obviously really contained. In terms of the hotel book, we have a couple of big hotel loans that are currently in operation, 2 or 3. We think they're well underwritten. And they have sort of broader context. So one of them, as an example, has a large condominium project that's been running for years associated with it. So a big part of our repayment actually comes from expats living in these condos as opposed to the hotel itself. One of the other operating loans is a wealthy relationship that we have a far broader deeper relationship and have real clear line of sight in terms of the family's wealth. So it's a hotel, it's secured by hotel, but it's really a much, much broader relationship than that. 
And then on the hotel construction, you hit it on the head. I mean we have the St. George's hotel that's really being built and is well on its way. We'll -- plan is to open up next year, which is hopefully not too bad timing given the fact it will be summer next year. We'll have some time to see how this all plays out. And on that loan, the Bermuda government has guaranteed $25 million out of our $60 million commitment. And lots of equity, lots of equity upfront, completely different underwriting than the bank did pre-financial crisis. So we feel pretty comfortable about both the total size relative to our total credit portfolio and also the individual credits within it. So we think it's pretty contained."

Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%. That's actually a Chamber of Commerce projection as opposed to government. Guernsey is minus 15% and Jersey is minus 6%. But, I -- it's -- everyone's sort of just trying to figure out where it's going. Obviously, Cayman has a bit more tourism exposure, so their 25% of GDP is tourism, while Bermuda is only 17%, and the Channel Islands is very little. Jersey's got some. So I'd say it's fair to say it's going to be double-digit declines in 2020, maybe lower to mid double-digit. But obviously, this is uncharted territory, so let's just see how that goes. 
In Bermuda, there's been a few small stimulus steps so far. So really small, just a sort of a $12 million small business government-guaranteed program. Bermuda set up unemployment insurance for the first time and has put out close to $20 million. A few thousand people are getting unemployment, weekly checks, processed through the banks, direct credit for the first time ever. So that's really the stimulus. I think the Ministry of Finance will come out in the near term and come up with a broader program. But at this point, Bermuda hasn't really stated exactly what the broader stimulus is going to be. But we do know that there's going to be some more borrowing in Bermuda to support it. 
Cayman has a surplus, has some reserves that they can use. They're talking about potentially borrowing a few hundred million. Guernsey and Jersey as well. So they're all in different stages of thinking about using their reserves in the other 3 islands and figuring out what sort of amount they want to borrow. And I'd say it's sort of 10% of GDP is pretty much across the board, so a few hundred million, maybe up to $500 million. And we want to be as helpful as possible in all our jurisdictions from a credit perspective. We know these economies better than anybody, so it's a good time to be able to support the governments. So mixed stimulus. It's sort of evolving. The U.K., obviously, is in a different situation, much broader programs. But I think the islands actually are going to be somewhat contained in terms of throwing money at it. So that's sort of where it is."

And obviously, the rate environment has changed quite dramatically over the last quarter. So I think we're in a stage where we are continuing obviously with the ABN repricing, but also being quite aggressive on deposit pricing, particularly term rollovers, et cetera. And so in essence, if you look at the euro balances, other currency balances on the slide, you'll see that that's where most of the attrition is coming from, and that will continue for another quarter or so. I would expect, just, again, trying to land the strategically important relationship, even those who have euro balances, providing that they also do other business with us. But obviously, we can't activate those euro balances in the form of loans, and so they really need to be priced at market. In terms of what's left in that bucket, I would quantify it around $200 million to $300 million, most of it, again, ABN. We haven't really seen any -- we've seen great stability across the other platforms, and actually, in Cayman, we're a bit up in terms of deposit levels since year-end. So the rest of the bank is really fairly stable, but there is still a bit to go on the euro balances in the Channel Islands."

The treatment of TDRs is really an accounting question. So it really comes from the U.S. GAAP accounting side and not necessarily from prudential side. So we obviously take the guidance from FASB on that, which has sort of broadly stated that, as you know, the TDR is up to 6 months, providing the customers good standing. It shouldn't necessarily become a TDR or a loan modification if it's a forbearance that's granted on that basis. And that's clearly the approach that we are taking as well with PWC here."

So we did take -- property prices went down, depending on whether it's a condo or a property, 20% to 40%, and we did get some pressure. But again, as you can see, the net charge-off today and even back then never got too high. So we have had experience, and I say that positively in the sense that I think we have a debt collection capability that's really good at this point, which we didn't have 10 years ago.

The other characteristic of that's -- a couple of characteristics of small island property markets, which tends to happen during periods of stress is that supply tends to withdraw because LTVs are very low. And so we get a lower number of transactions occurring for a period of time until prices sort of recover. And then the second thing is people -- there's a great deal of sort of social cohesion, like people know when they buy a property in Bermuda that they -- they don't really want to lose it, and so they have uncles and aunts and family members kind of helping out during periods of stress where -- to share the burden. And I think that's kind of helped a lot through the post-financial crisis in terms of keeping the mortgage book current and not having too many TDRs."

I can certainly confirm all the trust fees are being billed on -- as part of an annual fee. And then there's some activity fees when trust, restructure, et cetera, that we charge and/or enhanced tax reporting that we have to do under the common reporting standards or FATCA, et cetera. So those drive some activity-based fees, but they're not really related to an underlying market driver, if you will, it's more on a time spent basis. Again, so they're very capital efficient, very stable fees. And if you look over a period of -- since we went public, the only thing that's moved that fee number has been either acquisitions or sort of changes in underlying structures -- trust structures where the last beneficiary has passed away, et cetera. So those are very stable. 
Asset management, obviously, is impacted by underlying valuations. So we would expect those to be impacted and have been impacted, so you can see that over the quarters. Banking fees, in particular, is impacted through card services fees and merchant acquiring fees. So about 1/3 of the banking fees is in that bucket. And we would -- we've seen sort of leading indicators that seem to suggest maybe been an 80% drop in economic activity from debit card transactions, et cetera, during this period of stalled economic activity or government lockdowns that we've had in both Bermuda and Cayman, where you've got curfews and people have only been allowed to shop twice a week, et cetera. And that's just driven down, obviously -- not necessarily the number of transactions, but the value of the transactions. So certainly in the short term, I would expect that to be impacted quite significantly. FX has actually been up due to the volatility in currency players, particularly the dollar sterling. We've seen a lot of fund activity in the Channel Islands, which had a record quarter in terms of FX. So it's more volatility-driven as opposed to -- obviously, it's all FX commissions, there's no proprietary positions in there. So it really will just depend on what happens in the FX markets. And then the others are pretty small. Custody is pretty stable, it's a couple of basis points, as you would expect."

What are some of the actions that you've taken on the back of U.S. rate cuts?

So I'll kick off, it's Michael Schrum. So yes, let's start with the March 18 actions that we took. So obviously, in Bermuda, we took resi down by 50 basis points with a 45-day lag. So you would expect to see 50 basis points on the floating part of that book, which is 80% of that book coming through in Q2. U.K., we've sort of more or less seen a 25 basis points reduction. Again, that's mostly a floating book. It does have a floor of 50 basis points on it. So we're not expecting any further compression on the U.K. book, but I would expect to see a full quarter following the Central Bank easement in the U.K. as well. In Cayman, most of the book is floating. It's about 20% fixed. Again, between commercial and resi, we should expect the U.S. prime full impact of that, which will be around 100 basis points, obviously, a little bit into Q1, but most of it will come through in Q2. And then on the investment side or the non-loan asset side, on cash and short-term securities, those are mostly repriced. You'll recall that we have a sort of -- we manage our own liquidity, and we have a sort of 3-month T-Bill ladder, which tends to be set ahead of any Fed funds, obviously. So we've seen most of the impact there, but it could be another 15 to 25 basis points on cash and short-term securities. 
On the investment portfolio, some of that will depend on reinvestment rates, but I would expect some premium amortization, and to some extent, will depend on the CPT as well, which could be -- it's anyone's guess really, but we haven't seen accelerated prepayments yet, but it could be 5 to 15 basis points, call it, 10 basis points on investment portfolio over the next couple of quarters. And then offsetting that, obviously, we would expect a continued decline in the cost of deposits, not as much from demand because we're not yet charging negative rates on dollar deposits. But certainly on the term side, I would expect a further rollover benefit coming through the next couple of quarters. Most of that term money is really sitting in 3, 6 months, so it'll rollover into lower rates and probably generate an offset of about 10 to 15 basis points on the cost of deposits. 
So if you put all that together, over the next couple of quarters, you could see sort of a 25 to 35 basis point NIM compression. It will depend, to some extent, on loan demand in the market, both from what Michael spoke about in terms of government lending. It will also depend on where the tenure is. Currently, reinvestment rates in the $150 million range on MBS. And then obviously, the prepayment rates on MBS. So we're currently getting about $150 million to $200 million a quarter in maturities coming off that book. Again, if that obviously continues for a long period of time that will start to impact investment yields more meaningfully. But at the moment, we obviously bought that book to protect against interest rate risk in the banking book. We have an unrealized position now of $150 million in there. That will certainly help come through the coupons on the MBS securities over the next couple of years, and that was precisely why it's there in the first place."

I would have guessed that maybe given the delay in some of the integration in the Channel Islands that there may be -- the risk might be to the upside there, but it seems like you've taken some pretty good cost actions in the near term. I guess, can you just kind of walk us through near-term expectations on expenses? What sort of environmental impacts from the health crisis we might see on the expense line? What kind of cost cuts we could see? And then maybe any kind of tail impact of the integration of the Channel Islands deal in the third quarter, what impact that might have?

There's a corporate travel policy in mid-March. So that's one big expense item. When you operate these banks across multiple jurisdictions, obviously, there's a lot of travel, which is great. And obviously, client entertainment has also completely ceased at the moment or it's gone virtual at the moment, which obviously a lot less expensive. So we've seen a lot of benefit in the second part of March. And we would expect for that to continue to come down in the discretionary bucket. But again, that will be a short-term benefit. Coming out of lockdown, obviously, we'll start to gear up again. We are a relationship bank. And so it's important to -- for us to stay in touch with our customers, not just virtually, but also to spend time with them and understand what their business plans are, et cetera. 
On the more strategic side, obviously, we've taken action and deferred some of the capital spending programs, particularly around buildings, around brand rollout, resequenced that into a much slower burn rate at this point. We think we'd still obtain substantially the same benefits, but over a longer period of time. So people are not automatically getting new business cards, they're using the existing ones. We're not replacing the whole bins on the credit and debit cards, we're doing that gradually as cards expire, et cetera. We're -- we keep investing in the front line side of the business. So the branch refurb in Bermuda will still go ahead, which I think will be great. But some of the back office capital programs have been put on hold or are being reevaluated, as you would expect. 
Finally, I think amortization, as we talked about in the past as well, Butterfield built a very expensive system about 10 years ago, $120 million, which is -- the amortization is running off at the end of this quarter. And so moving into Q4, we would expect that to start helping. Effectively, that's $10 million annualized cost saving a year, of which we will put $2 million to $3 million back in, I expect, as part of normal system upgrades, et cetera, so net of $7 million there. And then obviously, depending on how long this goes on for, we'll need to look again more on a 0 basis or zero-based budgeting basis about -- I think it's been a bit of a reset for us. How many people do we need in the buildings, what do we really need to operate this business, et cetera. And so I'll just let Michael tune in on that."

So if you could just take Bermuda as an example, we're operating full retail services where  the operations with 59 people in the office out of about 500 and it's similar ratios across the different jurisdictions. So I think we are stepping back, and we're thinking about what the model should be and what the cost structure should be, assuming that we're going to be in a 0 interest rate environment for the long term. And so I think that has implications for a bank like Butterfield that's deposit led, and we understand that. So we're focused on what could the model look like as we come out of the pandemic. 
We have to be a little bit careful because while we're working remotely and things are operating very well, few client complaints at all, we have to recognize that volumes are way down as well. So we've got to sort of back test that to see how we could operate. But I think it is a real indication of a new working model that for a bank like Butterfield in very expensive jurisdictions, multiple currencies, multiple regulators, we are a pretty complex bank, and I think we're just going to do the work over the next quarter to see what a potential new cost structure model could look like. But first and foremost, the focus right now is, yes, do the work in the background, but at this point, we're here to support our employees as they service our client base."

So I guess, how are you thinking about your ability to kind of serve as almost like a strategic acquirer at a time when a lot of global banks may be looking to exit and potentially raise capital?"

I think we obviously learned a great deal from the financial crisis. And what Butterfield did in the past in terms of lending and our entire model has been focused on just in-market lending, no out-of-market lending, no credit exposure in the investment portfolio. So that's really positioned us quite well. That's not to say we won't have some residential mortgage issues here as the economies will start to open up, but from a broader perspective, we positioned ourselves from a credit perspective for this sort of event. So I think we feel pretty confident on that side. And I think you're right. It's a little -- obviously, right now, given the environment, no one's really doing much of anything in terms of necessarily near-term corporate development. But I think we do really believe that things will open up as markets start to operate again. And as we said, we're a decent-sized bank in Guernsey at this point, so 10%, 15% market share; 1% or 2%, Jersey. We do think there's still going to be some opportunities there as U.K. banks start to strategically reposition. And Singapore, which is more or less shut down right now, but luckily, it's a trust company as opposed to a bank, is still a great market for us, and we just really need to find some scale. So we do think there's going to be opportunities. But I would temper it just by saying in the next few months, people are just trying to get through the situation they're in. But I think going into the summer, things -- discussions may open up at that point. But to your point, we are -- have a really healthy balance sheet, and we're strategically positioned to execute the strategy we've been talking about for years."

I think people are pretty nervous. We actually are seeing some more interest in our jurisdictions from an estate planning perspective. Again, it's driven by a handful of lawyers in New York, London and Miami. So we're seeing actually some really good inward connections in terms of possibly new trust. I think existing trust, it's -- I think really people focusing on making sure that the structures make sense, that the beneficiaries are right, that sort of thing. So it's sort of the day-to-day stuff we do anyway, but probably enhanced today. Yes, you could see some deposit weakness. So we have some very large trust clients. And I think as -- not so much pulling money out necessarily to sort of put in a box somewhere, it's really I think people are seeing real investment opportunities. And so I think people -- I think some of the larger trust clients will put some of that money to work, but we also expect it to sort of flow in and out.

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum for additional details on COVID-19 from a credit perspective and comments on the first quarter results. 
Turning now to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. We reported net income of $40.3 million or $0.77 per share and core net income of $40.8 million and $0.78 per share. In the first quarter, net income was 8% lower than the previous quarter due to seasonal fee income and a $5.2 million CECL reserve build for future expected credit losses. Our core return on average tangible common equity was 18.6%, down from 21.1% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 2.63% compared to the last quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 8 basis points to 42 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 5. As we operate across small island communities, Butterfield has an important role to play as an essential service provider, a domestic systemically important bank, an employer, a source of working capital for companies in need and an active corporate citizen supporting our communities. We have a particularly strong sense of responsibility to balance the needs of all stakeholders during this time. The COVID-19 virus is evident in and impacting all of our operated jurisdictions. The number of infections and deaths in our various locations have been consistent with the statistics we're seeing globally. For Bermuda, there have been over 100 cases identified and sadly, 6 deaths. Cayman Islands have identified over 70 cases with 1 known death. And between Guernsey and Jersey, there have been hundreds of confirmed cases with known death as well. At this point, we only have 1 confirmed employee case in our Swiss office, who is expected to make a full recovery. We would like to express our deepest sympathies to anyone who has been directly affected or lost a loved one to the virus. We remain hopeful that the current shelter-in-place and social distancing practices will continue to slow the spread of the virus so that local economies and tourism can start to recover. 
When the severity of the crisis and health implications became known, the bank's initial focus was on the well-being of our customers and employees, including our ability to continue providing essential banking services. We quickly began mandating social distancing, providing protective equipment for staff, implementing split team and building strategies and establishing broad remote working conditions through our virtual desktop interface. We have remained operational as permitted, with just over 70% of employees working from home and providing all necessary equipment and services to support our employees and customers. 
To help ease the financial impact on the communities, we have temporarily deferred residential mortgage payments, reduced fees and increased our direct contributions to urgent care programs supporting the most vulnerable people. In the short term, we are working with clients to assess their needs and provide support. In Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is an important contributor to local activity as well as exports, we are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining frequent engagement with clients. In our estimation, the duration of the temporary shelter-in-place lockdown conditions is one of the most critical factors which will determine the return of economic activity and ultimately, the future impact on Butterfield. 
The bank keeps a significant source of liquidity available, primarily $3 billion of cash and short-term securities as well as $4.5 billion of U.S. agency MBS. Together, this represents just under 2/3 of all customer deposits. The current interest rate environment will impact our interest earnings from short-term securities as well as our variable rate loans, while lower deposit rates are unlikely to entirely offset the lost interest income. We also are seeing significantly decreased card services fees with no tourism and subdued domestic economic activity. 
Over the coming periods, we may also see increased prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio as U.S. home borrowers seek to refinance home loans in a lower interest rate environment. As we think about the medium and longer-term implications in the 3- to 5-year time frames, a sustained long-term ultralow interest rate environment could likely erode profitability over time. The bank has historically benefited from lower-cost deposit funding. However, in an ultralow interest rate environment, the value of those deposits reduces significantly and lower agency reinvestment rates would combine to compress NIM. This could ultimately alter the earnings profile of the bank and would result in increased reliance on fee businesses. If interest rates fall further to negative rates, we could be in a position to charge negative interest rates on deposits, as we have witnessed in Europe. We would also need to become more efficient through accelerated cost reductions. 
On the capital side, we are pleased to continue at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.44 per share, which represents a strong yield at recent share prices and remain active on share repurchases. We continue to believe the dividend rate is sustainable and continues to be a capital management priority. It is possible that M&A opportunities could become available as larger onshore financial institutions with banking and trust operations in our current operating jurisdictions may decide to focus on their core businesses and may want to sell less strategically important assets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide additional information on the bank's credit portfolio in potential COVID-exposed areas and then add some additional details regarding the first quarter results, including a discussion on the bank's capital position and management."

Before I give an overview of the first quarter results, I wanted to provide some information on some specific credit exposures. As you can see on the bottom left of Slide 5, we have fairly limited direct credit exposure to hotel and restaurant lending sectors, which is primarily in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Hotel operators and construction loans represent our biggest direct commercial COVID-related credit risk. However, given the structure of the deals, generally at below 50% pre-crisis LTVs and the underlying financial strength of the borrowers, we are not currently expecting significant losses from this area. If the crisis lingers several more quarters, one of the emerging areas where customers could start to see challenges may be in the part of the residential book with borrowers who currently work in tourism-related businesses. Finally, we do not have any direct exposure to the oil exploration or production sector. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and some details regarding the first quarter results. On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the first quarter, NIM of 2.63% increased 4 basis points as the cost of deposits, particularly term deposits, decreased from rollovers, which more than offset the decrease in interest income. Lower rates were partially passed along to borrowers, with yields on variable rate loans being 15 basis points lower in the quarter. Average loans increased during the first quarter as we had the benefit of a full quarter of lending to the Bermuda and Cayman governments, which were drawn late in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. Deposits at March 31, 2020, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 5.5% from the end of the year. The decrease is the result of the expected attrition of euro balances in the Channel Islands, which is consistent with previous guidance on the ABN deal. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 8 basis points due to lower term deposit pricing on rollovers. It is also worth noting that during the '08-'09 financial crisis, overall customer deposit levels did not reduce significantly, and at this point, we continue to see stability in deposit levels. 
Looking now at Slide 9. Noninterest income was down 4.3% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower card services fees, which were negatively impacted by reduced volumes as economic activity stalled in March due to government lockdowns. 
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense. As we discussed last quarter, first quarter expenses returned to the expected range after being elevated in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to reduced headcount in the Channel Islands, lower marketing expenses, travel expenses and client event costs. We continue to target a through cycle efficiency ratio of 60%. 
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues with our conservative capital management philosophy that balances regulatory requirements with shareholder returns. Tangible book value per share increased 4.6% in the first quarter due to contributions from earnings and OCI related to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We continue to view the dividend as the most direct and efficient way to translate the high ROE of the business to investor return. The dividend coverage ratio remains around 2x, and we believe the current dividend rate is sustainable. Our capital management priorities have not changed and continue to support the dividend, organic loan growth, share repurchases in appropriate market conditions and maintaining flexibility to pursue M&A deals when the right opportunities arise. 
Turning now to Slide 12. During the first quarter, the balance sheet was broadly stable, except for the continued decline in the euro-denominated deposits in the Channel Islands, as expected. End-of-period loan balances were down almost 3% due to the lower dollar value of pound sterling-denominated loans in the Channel Islands and the U.K. With the significant fall in U.S. interest rates, total net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio were $155 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $61 million at the year-end. 
On Slide 13, we continue to emphasize low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with the majority of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Loans are mostly residential and full recourse with 75% of the portfolio in the below 70% LTV bucket. In light of COVID-19 and its potential future impact on particularly unsecured loans, we have increased our reserve estimate by $5.2 million, and the total reserve under CECL is now 72 basis points of gross loans, reflective of the collateral-backed residential lending platforms built over the last decade. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. The structural asset sensitivity of the balance sheet has now been entirely realized by the reduction in front-end rates. Therefore, the downside 100 basis points scenario would start to increase NII if the bank passes negative rates on to customers by increasing spread on demand deposits. The assumption on negative U.S. dollar deposit rates would be similar to what we've seen in Europe. In the upside 100 basis point scenario, the bank starts to increase net interest income with a positive differential between deposit and market rates. Additionally, reinvestment rates would improve, thereby improving net interest income also. 
I'll now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Butterfield's integration in the Channel Island is progressing well and into its final stages. We now expect the full operational integration to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 as most clients are also working remotely, and it is practically much safer to upgrade their banking systems once customers are back in their offices sometimes in the second quarter of 2020. 
Following the success of the Channel Islands, we remain committed to exploring potential acquisitions in banking and trust, with most opportunities in the Channel Islands for banking and trust. For the trust network, we would also seek to build on the potential in Asia with a larger trust presence in Singapore. While we do not have any specific communications on this at the moment, these discussions are still continuing. 
The effect of this health crisis on Butterfield will depend on uncertain factors, including the length and depth of the pandemic and associated government lockdowns, how that impacts domestic economic activity and tourism, how quickly can these recover as well as the interest rate environment. Our communications with the regulators, rating agencies and governments remain constructive and supportive. 
The bank continues to have a strong and flexible capital position with a very liquid balance sheet. Learning from the financial crisis a decade ago, Butterfield's credit underwriting has been conservative, and as a result, our exposure to potentially problematic sectors is limited and should place the bank in a strong position to emerge from the current crisis. 
As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity again to thank our employees, particularly those in the front line and retail branches, continuing to welcome customers and helping them and us through a difficult period. Thank you.

A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model. We don't use a third-party service provider to provide data as all of our loans are primarily manually underwritten. And so we use part of our own history -- repayment history, obviously, and local market conditions and where we operate. We do use, of course, external data in the model, including primarily unemployment forecasts as well as GDP forecasts. And for that, we use a combination of service providers, including Moody's and Bloomberg. 
The underlying assumptions for the model going in to this year, obviously, changed a lot since the end of the year, which is driving the additional reserve build in this quarter. So overall, we've landed on a negative 3 GDP -- U.S. GDP forecast for this year, which is one of the central assumptions. Obviously, that has a big shock in the second quarter to economic activity of double digits and then sort of a -- more of a U-shaped recovery into Q4. Again, the model is somewhat sensitive, obviously, to the external variables. But I would say, because most of the loan book is residential and manually underwritten, we have more of a straight line to realizing collateral in a troubled situation. So it mostly impacts the loan buckets that are -- where debt service coverage is really cash flow-based, so that would be the sort of C&I book and the credit card book. But again, those are relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So hopefully, that helps a bit."

On the commercial side, we're working with all of our commercial customers daily, trying to find out how they're doing and figuring out where we can help. So that's obviously very specific discussions individually as opposed to any broader program. We're going to look at it in 3 months on the residential side, see where we are. There is some chance we could extend it for an additional period. But obviously, everything's so fluid right now. We're just going to wait and see.

So as you can see on Page 5, we have a total of $214 million of hotel and restaurant exposure out of the $5.2 billion book, so only about 4%. I mean, interestingly, restaurants are about $7 million, which is obviously really contained. In terms of the hotel book, we have a couple of big hotel loans that are currently in operation, 2 or 3. We think they're well underwritten. And they have sort of broader context. So one of them, as an example, has a large condominium project that's been running for years associated with it. So a big part of our repayment actually comes from expats living in these condos as opposed to the hotel itself. One of the other operating loans is a wealthy relationship that we have a far broader deeper relationship and have real clear line of sight in terms of the family's wealth. So it's a hotel, it's secured by hotel, but it's really a much, much broader relationship than that. 
And then on the hotel construction, you hit it on the head. I mean we have the St. George's hotel that's really being built and is well on its way. We'll -- plan is to open up next year, which is hopefully not too bad timing given the fact it will be summer next year. We'll have some time to see how this all plays out. And on that loan, the Bermuda government has guaranteed $25 million out of our $60 million commitment. And lots of equity, lots of equity upfront, completely different underwriting than the bank did pre-financial crisis. So we feel pretty comfortable about both the total size relative to our total credit portfolio and also the individual credits within it. So we think it's pretty contained."

Sure. So I'll just give you a sense of where the different governments are projecting GDP for 2020. Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%.

Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%. That's actually a Chamber of Commerce projection as opposed to government. Guernsey is minus 15% and Jersey is minus 6%. But, I -- it's -- everyone's sort of just trying to figure out where it's going. Obviously, Cayman has a bit more tourism exposure, so their 25% of GDP is tourism, while Bermuda is only 17%, and the Channel Islands is very little. Jersey's got some. So I'd say it's fair to say it's going to be double-digit declines in 2020, maybe lower to mid double-digit. But obviously, this is uncharted territory, so let's just see how that goes. 
In Bermuda, there's been a few small stimulus steps so far. So really small, just a sort of a $12 million small business government-guaranteed program. Bermuda set up unemployment insurance for the first time and has put out close to $20 million. A few thousand people are getting unemployment, weekly checks, processed through the banks, direct credit for the first time ever. So that's really the stimulus. I think the Ministry of Finance will come out in the near term and come up with a broader program. But at this point, Bermuda hasn't really stated exactly what the broader stimulus is going to be. But we do know that there's going to be some more borrowing in Bermuda to support it. 
Cayman has a surplus, has some reserves that they can use. They're talking about potentially borrowing a few hundred million. Guernsey and Jersey as well. So they're all in different stages of thinking about using their reserves in the other 3 islands and figuring out what sort of amount they want to borrow. And I'd say it's sort of 10% of GDP is pretty much across the board, so a few hundred million, maybe up to $500 million. And we want to be as helpful as possible in all our jurisdictions from a credit perspective. We know these economies better than anybody, so it's a good time to be able to support the governments. So mixed stimulus. It's sort of evolving. The U.K., obviously, is in a different situation, much broader programs. But I think the islands actually are going to be somewhat contained in terms of throwing money at it. So that's sort of where it is."

And obviously, the rate environment has changed quite dramatically over the last quarter. So I think we're in a stage where we are continuing obviously with the ABN repricing, but also being quite aggressive on deposit pricing, particularly term rollovers, et cetera. And so in essence, if you look at the euro balances, other currency balances on the slide, you'll see that that's where most of the attrition is coming from, and that will continue for another quarter or so. I would expect, just, again, trying to land the strategically important relationship, even those who have euro balances, providing that they also do other business with us. But obviously, we can't activate those euro balances in the form of loans, and so they really need to be priced at market. In terms of what's left in that bucket, I would quantify it around $200 million to $300 million, most of it, again, ABN. We haven't really seen any -- we've seen great stability across the other platforms, and actually, in Cayman, we're a bit up in terms of deposit levels since year-end. So the rest of the bank is really fairly stable, but there is still a bit to go on the euro balances in the Channel Islands."

The treatment of TDRs is really an accounting question. So it really comes from the U.S. GAAP accounting side and not necessarily from prudential side. So we obviously take the guidance from FASB on that, which has sort of broadly stated that, as you know, the TDR is up to 6 months, providing the customers good standing. It shouldn't necessarily become a TDR or a loan modification if it's a forbearance that's granted on that basis. And that's clearly the approach that we are taking as well with PWC here."

And then the second thing is people -- there's a great deal of sort of social cohesion, like people know when they buy a property in Bermuda that they -- they don't really want to lose it, and so they have uncles and aunts and family members kind of helping out during periods of stress where -- to share the burden. And I think that's kind of helped a lot through the post-financial crisis in terms of keeping the mortgage book current and not having too many TDRs."

I can certainly confirm all the trust fees are being billed on -- as part of an annual fee. And then there's some activity fees when trust, restructure, et cetera, that we charge and/or enhanced tax reporting that we have to do under the common reporting standards or FATCA, et cetera. So those drive some activity-based fees, but they're not really related to an underlying market driver, if you will, it's more on a time spent basis. Again, so they're very capital efficient, very stable fees. And if you look over a period of -- since we went public, the only thing that's moved that fee number has been either acquisitions or sort of changes in underlying structures -- trust structures where the last beneficiary has passed away, et cetera. So those are very stable. 
Asset management, obviously, is impacted by underlying valuations. So we would expect those to be impacted and have been impacted, so you can see that over the quarters. Banking fees, in particular, is impacted through card services fees and merchant acquiring fees. So about 1/3 of the banking fees is in that bucket. And we would -- we've seen sort of leading indicators that seem to suggest maybe been an 80% drop in economic activity from debit card transactions, et cetera, during this period of stalled economic activity or government lockdowns that we've had in both Bermuda and Cayman, where you've got curfews and people have only been allowed to shop twice a week, et cetera. And that's just driven down, obviously -- not necessarily the number of transactions, but the value of the transactions. So certainly in the short term, I would expect that to be impacted quite significantly. FX has actually been up due to the volatility in currency players, particularly the dollar sterling. We've seen a lot of fund activity in the Channel Islands, which had a record quarter in terms of FX. So it's more volatility-driven as opposed to -- obviously, it's all FX commissions, there's no proprietary positions in there. So it really will just depend on what happens in the FX markets. And then the others are pretty small. Custody is pretty stable, it's a couple of basis points, as you would expect."

I was wondering if maybe we could spend a little bit more time on some of the PPNR dynamics over the next several quarters. I appreciate some of the comments in the prepared remarks about the impact of lower interest rates on the net interest margin. I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving pieces, given a lot of the portfolio is floating rate, just what are some of the moving pieces in the portfolio? What are some of the actions that you've taken on the back of U.S. rate cuts? And are there any ameliorating factors that could kind of lessen the decline in your loan yields relative to what kind of U.S. benchmark rates have done?"
874003,662809223,1995882,"The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited, Q1 2020 Earnings Call, May 01, 2020",2020-05-01,"Earnings Calls","The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Yes.

So I'll kick off, it's Michael Schrum. So yes, let's start with the March 18 actions that we took. So obviously, in Bermuda, we took resi down by 50 basis points with a 45-day lag. So you would expect to see 50 basis points on the floating part of that book, which is 80% of that book coming through in Q2. U.K., we've sort of more or less seen a 25 basis points reduction. Again, that's mostly a floating book. It does have a floor of 50 basis points on it. So we're not expecting any further compression on the U.K. book, but I would expect to see a full quarter following the Central Bank easement in the U.K. as well. In Cayman, most of the book is floating. It's about 20% fixed. Again, between commercial and resi, we should expect the U.S. prime full impact of that, which will be around 100 basis points, obviously, a little bit into Q1, but most of it will come through in Q2. And then on the investment side or the non-loan asset side, on cash and short-term securities, those are mostly repriced. You'll recall that we have a sort of -- we manage our own liquidity, and we have a sort of 3-month T-Bill ladder, which tends to be set ahead of any Fed funds, obviously. So we've seen most of the impact there, but it could be another 15 to 25 basis points on cash and short-term securities. 
On the investment portfolio, some of that will depend on reinvestment rates, but I would expect some premium amortization, and to some extent, will depend on the CPT as well, which could be -- it's anyone's guess really, but we haven't seen accelerated prepayments yet, but it could be 5 to 15 basis points, call it, 10 basis points on investment portfolio over the next couple of quarters. And then offsetting that, obviously, we would expect a continued decline in the cost of deposits, not as much from demand because we're not yet charging negative rates on dollar deposits. But certainly on the term side, I would expect a further rollover benefit coming through the next couple of quarters. Most of that term money is really sitting in 3, 6 months, so it'll rollover into lower rates and probably generate an offset of about 10 to 15 basis points on the cost of deposits. 
So if you put all that together, over the next couple of quarters, you could see sort of a 25 to 35 basis point NIM compression. It will depend, to some extent, on loan demand in the market, both from what Michael spoke about in terms of government lending. It will also depend on where the tenure is. Currently, reinvestment rates in the $150 million range on MBS. And then obviously, the prepayment rates on MBS. So we're currently getting about $150 million to $200 million a quarter in maturities coming off that book. Again, if that obviously continues for a long period of time that will start to impact investment yields more meaningfully. But at the moment, we obviously bought that book to protect against interest rate risk in the banking book. We have an unrealized position now of $150 million in there. That will certainly help come through the coupons on the MBS securities over the next couple of years, and that was precisely why it's there in the first place."

And maybe on the expense side, the expense levels came in a lot lower than I think most people were expecting this quarter. I would have guessed that maybe given the delay in some of the integration in the Channel Islands that there may be -- the risk might be to the upside there, but it seems like you've taken some pretty good cost actions in the near term. I guess, can you just kind of walk us through near-term expectations on expenses? What sort of environmental impacts from the health crisis we might see on the expense line? What kind of cost cuts we could see? And then maybe any kind of tail impact of the integration of the Channel Islands deal in the third quarter, what impact that might have? I know that there's a lot of moving pieces there."

There's a corporate travel policy in mid-March. So that's one big expense item. When you operate these banks across multiple jurisdictions, obviously, there's a lot of travel, which is great. And obviously, client entertainment has also completely ceased at the moment or it's gone virtual at the moment, which obviously a lot less expensive. So we've seen a lot of benefit in the second part of March. And we would expect for that to continue to come down in the discretionary bucket. But again, that will be a short-term benefit. Coming out of lockdown, obviously, we'll start to gear up again. We are a relationship bank. And so it's important to -- for us to stay in touch with our customers, not just virtually, but also to spend time with them and understand what their business plans are, et cetera. 
On the more strategic side, obviously, we've taken action and deferred some of the capital spending programs, particularly around buildings, around brand rollout, resequenced that into a much slower burn rate at this point. We think we'd still obtain substantially the same benefits, but over a longer period of time. So people are not automatically getting new business cards, they're using the existing ones. We're not replacing the whole bins on the credit and debit cards, we're doing that gradually as cards expire, et cetera. We're -- we keep investing in the front line side of the business. So the branch refurb in Bermuda will still go ahead, which I think will be great. But some of the back office capital programs have been put on hold or are being reevaluated, as you would expect. 
Finally, I think amortization, as we talked about in the past as well, Butterfield built a very expensive system about 10 years ago, $120 million, which is -- the amortization is running off at the end of this quarter. And so moving into Q4, we would expect that to start helping. Effectively, that's $10 million annualized cost saving a year, of which we will put $2 million to $3 million back in, I expect, as part of normal system upgrades, et cetera, so net of $7 million there. And then obviously, depending on how long this goes on for, we'll need to look again more on a 0 basis or zero-based budgeting basis about -- I think it's been a bit of a reset for us. How many people do we need in the buildings, what do we really need to operate this business, et cetera. And so I'll just let Michael tune in on that."

So I think -- I mean, our focus, obviously, right now, the next quarter or 2 is just making sure everyone is safe and operating well and being supported. So lots of communication. I would say it's remarkable how we've been able to operate working remotely, which is a really interesting part of the model today. So today, across our 1,500 employees, we mentioned 70% are working remotely, 15% are at home not working, 15% are in the office. So if you could just take Bermuda as an example, we're operating full retail services where  the operations with 59 people in the office out of about 500 and it's similar ratios across the different jurisdictions. So I think we are stepping back, and we're thinking about what the model should be and what the cost structure should be, assuming that we're going to be in a 0 interest rate environment for the long term. And so I think that has implications for a bank like Butterfield that's deposit led, and we understand that. So we're focused on what could the model look like as we come out of the pandemic. 
We have to be a little bit careful because while we're working remotely and things are operating very well, few client complaints at all, we have to recognize that volumes are way down as well. So we've got to sort of back test that to see how we could operate. But I think it is a real indication of a new working model that for a bank like Butterfield in very expensive jurisdictions, multiple currencies, multiple regulators, we are a pretty complex bank, and I think we're just going to do the work over the next quarter to see what a potential new cost structure model could look like. But first and foremost, the focus right now is, yes, do the work in the background, but at this point, we're here to support our employees as they service our client base."

That's not to say we won't have some residential mortgage issues here as the economies will start to open up, but from a broader perspective, we positioned ourselves from a credit perspective for this sort of event. So I think we feel pretty confident on that side. And I think you're right. It's a little -- obviously, right now, given the environment, no one's really doing much of anything in terms of necessarily near-term corporate development. But I think we do really believe that things will open up as markets start to operate again. And as we said, we're a decent-sized bank in Guernsey at this point, so 10%, 15% market share; 1% or 2%, Jersey. We do think there's still going to be some opportunities there as U.K. banks start to strategically reposition. And Singapore, which is more or less shut down right now, but luckily, it's a trust company as opposed to a bank, is still a great market for us, and we just really need to find some scale. So we do think there's going to be opportunities. But I would temper it just by saying in the next few months, people are just trying to get through the situation they're in. But I think going into the summer, things -- discussions may open up at that point. But to your point, we are -- have a really healthy balance sheet, and we're strategically positioned to execute the strategy we've been talking about for years."

I think existing trust, it's -- I think really people focusing on making sure that the structures make sense, that the beneficiaries are right, that sort of thing. So it's sort of the day-to-day stuff we do anyway, but probably enhanced today. Yes, you could see some deposit weakness. So we have some very large trust clients.

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum for additional details on COVID-19 from a credit perspective and comments on the first quarter results. 
Turning now to Slide 4 of the earnings deck. We reported net income of $40.3 million or $0.77 per share and core net income of $40.8 million and $0.78 per share. In the first quarter, net income was 8% lower than the previous quarter due to seasonal fee income and a $5.2 million CECL reserve build for future expected credit losses. Our core return on average tangible common equity was 18.6%, down from 21.1% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was up 4 basis points to 2.63% compared to the last quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 8 basis points to 42 basis points. 
Turning now to Slide 5. As we operate across small island communities, Butterfield has an important role to play as an essential service provider, a domestic systemically important bank, an employer, a source of working capital for companies in need and an active corporate citizen supporting our communities. We have a particularly strong sense of responsibility to balance the needs of all stakeholders during this time. The COVID-19 virus is evident in and impacting all of our operated jurisdictions. The number of infections and deaths in our various locations have been consistent with the statistics we're seeing globally. For Bermuda, there have been over 100 cases identified and sadly, 6 deaths. Cayman Islands have identified over 70 cases with 1 known death. And between Guernsey and Jersey, there have been hundreds of confirmed cases with known death as well. At this point, we only have 1 confirmed employee case in our Swiss office, who is expected to make a full recovery. We would like to express our deepest sympathies to anyone who has been directly affected or lost a loved one to the virus. We remain hopeful that the current shelter-in-place and social distancing practices will continue to slow the spread of the virus so that local economies and tourism can start to recover. 
When the severity of the crisis and health implications became known, the bank's initial focus was on the well-being of our customers and employees, including our ability to continue providing essential banking services. We quickly began mandating social distancing, providing protective equipment for staff, implementing split team and building strategies and establishing broad remote working conditions through our virtual desktop interface. We have remained operational as permitted, with just over 70% of employees working from home and providing all necessary equipment and services to support our employees and customers. 
To help ease the financial impact on the communities, we have temporarily deferred residential mortgage payments, reduced fees and increased our direct contributions to urgent care programs supporting the most vulnerable people. In the short term, we are working with clients to assess their needs and provide support. In Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is an important contributor to local activity as well as exports, we are closely monitoring the situation and maintaining frequent engagement with clients. In our estimation, the duration of the temporary shelter-in-place lockdown conditions is one of the most critical factors which will determine the return of economic activity and ultimately, the future impact on Butterfield. 
The bank keeps a significant source of liquidity available, primarily $3 billion of cash and short-term securities as well as $4.5 billion of U.S. agency MBS. Together, this represents just under 2/3 of all customer deposits. The current interest rate environment will impact our interest earnings from short-term securities as well as our variable rate loans, while lower deposit rates are unlikely to entirely offset the lost interest income. We also are seeing significantly decreased card services fees with no tourism and subdued domestic economic activity. 
Over the coming periods, we may also see increased prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio as U.S. home borrowers seek to refinance home loans in a lower interest rate environment. As we think about the medium and longer-term implications in the 3- to 5-year time frames, a sustained long-term ultralow interest rate environment could likely erode profitability over time. The bank has historically benefited from lower-cost deposit funding. However, in an ultralow interest rate environment, the value of those deposits reduces significantly and lower agency reinvestment rates would combine to compress NIM. This could ultimately alter the earnings profile of the bank and would result in increased reliance on fee businesses. If interest rates fall further to negative rates, we could be in a position to charge negative interest rates on deposits, as we have witnessed in Europe. We would also need to become more efficient through accelerated cost reductions. 
On the capital side, we are pleased to continue at the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.44 per share, which represents a strong yield at recent share prices and remain active on share repurchases. We continue to believe the dividend rate is sustainable and continues to be a capital management priority. It is possible that M&A opportunities could become available as larger onshore financial institutions with banking and trust operations in our current operating jurisdictions may decide to focus on their core businesses and may want to sell less strategically important assets. 
I'll now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide additional information on the bank's credit portfolio in potential COVID-exposed areas and then add some additional details regarding the first quarter results, including a discussion on the bank's capital position and management."

Before I give an overview of the first quarter results, I wanted to provide some information on some specific credit exposures. As you can see on the bottom left of Slide 5, we have fairly limited direct credit exposure to hotel and restaurant lending sectors, which is primarily in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Hotel operators and construction loans represent our biggest direct commercial COVID-related credit risk. However, given the structure of the deals, generally at below 50% pre-crisis LTVs and the underlying financial strength of the borrowers, we are not currently expecting significant losses from this area. If the crisis lingers several more quarters, one of the emerging areas where customers could start to see challenges may be in the part of the residential book with borrowers who currently work in tourism-related businesses. Finally, we do not have any direct exposure to the oil exploration or production sector. 
Turning now to Slide 7 and some details regarding the first quarter results. On Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the first quarter, NIM of 2.63% increased 4 basis points as the cost of deposits, particularly term deposits, decreased from rollovers, which more than offset the decrease in interest income. Lower rates were partially passed along to borrowers, with yields on variable rate loans being 15 basis points lower in the quarter. Average loans increased during the first quarter as we had the benefit of a full quarter of lending to the Bermuda and Cayman governments, which were drawn late in the fourth quarter. 
On Slide 8, we provide an overview of average customer deposit balances by location, currency and contractual nature. Deposits at March 31, 2020, were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 5.5% from the end of the year. The decrease is the result of the expected attrition of euro balances in the Channel Islands, which is consistent with previous guidance on the ABN deal. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 8 basis points due to lower term deposit pricing on rollovers. It is also worth noting that during the '08-'09 financial crisis, overall customer deposit levels did not reduce significantly, and at this point, we continue to see stability in deposit levels. 
Looking now at Slide 9. Noninterest income was down 4.3% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to lower card services fees, which were negatively impacted by reduced volumes as economic activity stalled in March due to government lockdowns. 
On Slide 10, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense. As we discussed last quarter, first quarter expenses returned to the expected range after being elevated in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to reduced headcount in the Channel Islands, lower marketing expenses, travel expenses and client event costs. We continue to target a through cycle efficiency ratio of 60%. 
Looking now at Slide 11, we provide a summary of regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues with our conservative capital management philosophy that balances regulatory requirements with shareholder returns. Tangible book value per share increased 4.6% in the first quarter due to contributions from earnings and OCI related to the unrealized gains in the investment portfolio. We continue to view the dividend as the most direct and efficient way to translate the high ROE of the business to investor return. The dividend coverage ratio remains around 2x, and we believe the current dividend rate is sustainable. Our capital management priorities have not changed and continue to support the dividend, organic loan growth, share repurchases in appropriate market conditions and maintaining flexibility to pursue M&A deals when the right opportunities arise. 
Turning now to Slide 12. During the first quarter, the balance sheet was broadly stable, except for the continued decline in the euro-denominated deposits in the Channel Islands, as expected. End-of-period loan balances were down almost 3% due to the lower dollar value of pound sterling-denominated loans in the Channel Islands and the U.K. With the significant fall in U.S. interest rates, total net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio were $155 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $61 million at the year-end. 
On Slide 13, we continue to emphasize low credit risk in our investment portfolio, with the majority of investments in AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Loans are mostly residential and full recourse with 75% of the portfolio in the below 70% LTV bucket. In light of COVID-19 and its potential future impact on particularly unsecured loans, we have increased our reserve estimate by $5.2 million, and the total reserve under CECL is now 72 basis points of gross loans, reflective of the collateral-backed residential lending platforms built over the last decade. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. The structural asset sensitivity of the balance sheet has now been entirely realized by the reduction in front-end rates. Therefore, the downside 100 basis points scenario would start to increase NII if the bank passes negative rates on to customers by increasing spread on demand deposits. The assumption on negative U.S. dollar deposit rates would be similar to what we've seen in Europe. In the upside 100 basis point scenario, the bank starts to increase net interest income with a positive differential between deposit and market rates. Additionally, reinvestment rates would improve, thereby improving net interest income also. 
I'll now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Butterfield's integration in the Channel Island is progressing well and into its final stages. We now expect the full operational integration to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 as most clients are also working remotely, and it is practically much safer to upgrade their banking systems once customers are back in their offices sometimes in the second quarter of 2020. 
Following the success of the Channel Islands, we remain committed to exploring potential acquisitions in banking and trust, with most opportunities in the Channel Islands for banking and trust. For the trust network, we would also seek to build on the potential in Asia with a larger trust presence in Singapore. While we do not have any specific communications on this at the moment, these discussions are still continuing. 
The effect of this health crisis on Butterfield will depend on uncertain factors, including the length and depth of the pandemic and associated government lockdowns, how that impacts domestic economic activity and tourism, how quickly can these recover as well as the interest rate environment. Our communications with the regulators, rating agencies and governments remain constructive and supportive. 
The bank continues to have a strong and flexible capital position with a very liquid balance sheet. Learning from the financial crisis a decade ago, Butterfield's credit underwriting has been conservative, and as a result, our exposure to potentially problematic sectors is limited and should place the bank in a strong position to emerge from the current crisis. 
As a final note, I would like to take this opportunity again to thank our employees, particularly those in the front line and retail branches, continuing to welcome customers and helping them and us through a difficult period. Thank you. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

A lot of work has gone into CECL over the last year, obviously, building the model. We don't use a third-party service provider to provide data as all of our loans are primarily manually underwritten. And so we use part of our own history -- repayment history, obviously, and local market conditions and where we operate. We do use, of course, external data in the model, including primarily unemployment forecasts as well as GDP forecasts. And for that, we use a combination of service providers, including Moody's and Bloomberg. 
The underlying assumptions for the model going in to this year, obviously, changed a lot since the end of the year, which is driving the additional reserve build in this quarter. So overall, we've landed on a negative 3 GDP -- U.S. GDP forecast for this year, which is one of the central assumptions. Obviously, that has a big shock in the second quarter to economic activity of double digits and then sort of a -- more of a U-shaped recovery into Q4. Again, the model is somewhat sensitive, obviously, to the external variables. But I would say, because most of the loan book is residential and manually underwritten, we have more of a straight line to realizing collateral in a troubled situation. So it mostly impacts the loan buckets that are -- where debt service coverage is really cash flow-based, so that would be the sort of C&I book and the credit card book. But again, those are relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So hopefully, that helps a bit."

On the commercial side, we're working with all of our commercial customers daily, trying to find out how they're doing and figuring out where we can help. So that's obviously very specific discussions individually as opposed to any broader program. We're going to look at it in 3 months on the residential side, see where we are. There is some chance we could extend it for an additional period. But obviously, everything's so fluid right now. We're just going to wait and see.

I mean, interestingly, restaurants are about $7 million, which is obviously really contained. In terms of the hotel book, we have a couple of big hotel loans that are currently in operation, 2 or 3. We think they're well underwritten. And they have sort of broader context. So one of them, as an example, has a large condominium project that's been running for years associated with it. So a big part of our repayment actually comes from expats living in these condos as opposed to the hotel itself. One of the other operating loans is a wealthy relationship that we have a far broader deeper relationship and have real clear line of sight in terms of the family's wealth. So it's a hotel, it's secured by hotel, but it's really a much, much broader relationship than that. 
And then on the hotel construction, you hit it on the head. I mean we have the St. George's hotel that's really being built and is well on its way. We'll -- plan is to open up next year, which is hopefully not too bad timing given the fact it will be summer next year. We'll have some time to see how this all plays out. And on that loan, the Bermuda government has guaranteed $25 million out of our $60 million commitment. And lots of equity, lots of equity upfront, completely different underwriting than the bank did pre-financial crisis. So we feel pretty comfortable about both the total size relative to our total credit portfolio and also the individual credits within it. So we think it's pretty contained."

Bermuda's projection -- government projection is minus 7.5% to 12.5%. Cayman is minus 15%. That's actually a Chamber of Commerce projection as opposed to government. Guernsey is minus 15% and Jersey is minus 6%. But, I -- it's -- everyone's sort of just trying to figure out where it's going. Obviously, Cayman has a bit more tourism exposure, so their 25% of GDP is tourism, while Bermuda is only 17%, and the Channel Islands is very little. Jersey's got some. So I'd say it's fair to say it's going to be double-digit declines in 2020, maybe lower to mid double-digit. But obviously, this is uncharted territory, so let's just see how that goes. 
In Bermuda, there's been a few small stimulus steps so far. So really small, just a sort of a $12 million small business government-guaranteed program. Bermuda set up unemployment insurance for the first time and has put out close to $20 million. A few thousand people are getting unemployment, weekly checks, processed through the banks, direct credit for the first time ever. So that's really the stimulus. I think the Ministry of Finance will come out in the near term and come up with a broader program. But at this point, Bermuda hasn't really stated exactly what the broader stimulus is going to be. But we do know that there's going to be some more borrowing in Bermuda to support it. 
Cayman has a surplus, has some reserves that they can use. They're talking about potentially borrowing a few hundred million. Guernsey and Jersey as well. So they're all in different stages of thinking about using their reserves in the other 3 islands and figuring out what sort of amount they want to borrow. And I'd say it's sort of 10% of GDP is pretty much across the board, so a few hundred million, maybe up to $500 million. And we want to be as helpful as possible in all our jurisdictions from a credit perspective. We know these economies better than anybody, so it's a good time to be able to support the governments. So mixed stimulus. It's sort of evolving. The U.K., obviously, is in a different situation, much broader programs. But I think the islands actually are going to be somewhat contained in terms of throwing money at it. So that's sort of where it is."

And obviously, the rate environment has changed quite dramatically over the last quarter. So I think we're in a stage where we are continuing obviously with the ABN repricing, but also being quite aggressive on deposit pricing, particularly term rollovers, et cetera. And so in essence, if you look at the euro balances, other currency balances on the slide, you'll see that that's where most of the attrition is coming from, and that will continue for another quarter or so. I would expect, just, again, trying to land the strategically important relationship, even those who have euro balances, providing that they also do other business with us. But obviously, we can't activate those euro balances in the form of loans, and so they really need to be priced at market. In terms of what's left in that bucket, I would quantify it around $200 million to $300 million, most of it, again, ABN. We haven't really seen any -- we've seen great stability across the other platforms, and actually, in Cayman, we're a bit up in terms of deposit levels since year-end. So the rest of the bank is really fairly stable, but there is still a bit to go on the euro balances in the Channel Islands."

The treatment of TDRs is really an accounting question. So it really comes from the U.S. GAAP accounting side and not necessarily from prudential side. So we obviously take the guidance from FASB on that, which has sort of broadly stated that, as you know, the TDR is up to 6 months, providing the customers good standing. It shouldn't necessarily become a TDR or a loan modification if it's a forbearance that's granted on that basis. And that's clearly the approach that we are taking as well with PWC here."

I can certainly confirm all the trust fees are being billed on -- as part of an annual fee. And then there's some activity fees when trust, restructure, et cetera, that we charge and/or enhanced tax reporting that we have to do under the common reporting standards or FATCA, et cetera. So those drive some activity-based fees, but they're not really related to an underlying market driver, if you will, it's more on a time spent basis. Again, so they're very capital efficient, very stable fees. And if you look over a period of -- since we went public, the only thing that's moved that fee number has been either acquisitions or sort of changes in underlying structures -- trust structures where the last beneficiary has passed away, et cetera. So those are very stable. 
Asset management, obviously, is impacted by underlying valuations. So we would expect those to be impacted and have been impacted, so you can see that over the quarters. Banking fees, in particular, is impacted through card services fees and merchant acquiring fees. So about 1/3 of the banking fees is in that bucket. And we would -- we've seen sort of leading indicators that seem to suggest maybe been an 80% drop in economic activity from debit card transactions, et cetera, during this period of stalled economic activity or government lockdowns that we've had in both Bermuda and Cayman, where you've got curfews and people have only been allowed to shop twice a week, et cetera. And that's just driven down, obviously -- not necessarily the number of transactions, but the value of the transactions. So certainly in the short term, I would expect that to be impacted quite significantly. FX has actually been up due to the volatility in currency players, particularly the dollar sterling. We've seen a lot of fund activity in the Channel Islands, which had a record quarter in terms of FX. So it's more volatility-driven as opposed to -- obviously, it's all FX commissions, there's no proprietary positions in there. So it really will just depend on what happens in the FX markets. And then the others are pretty small. Custody is pretty stable, it's a couple of basis points, as you would expect."

I was wondering if maybe we could spend a little bit more time on some of the PPNR dynamics over the next several quarters. I appreciate some of the comments in the prepared remarks about the impact of lower interest rates on the net interest margin. I was wondering if you could walk us through some of the moving pieces, given a lot of the portfolio is floating rate, just what are some of the moving pieces in the portfolio? What are some of the actions that you've taken on the back of U.S. rate cuts? And are there any ameliorating factors that could kind of lessen the decline in your loan yields relative to what kind of U.S. benchmark rates have done?"

So I'll kick off, it's Michael Schrum. So yes, let's start with the March 18 actions that we took. So obviously, in Bermuda, we took resi down by 50 basis points with a 45-day lag. So you would expect to see 50 basis points on the floating part of that book, which is 80% of that book coming through in Q2. U.K., we've sort of more or less seen a 25 basis points reduction. Again, that's mostly a floating book. It does have a floor of 50 basis points on it. So we're not expecting any further compression on the U.K. book, but I would expect to see a full quarter following the Central Bank easement in the U.K. as well. In Cayman, most of the book is floating. It's about 20% fixed. Again, between commercial and resi, we should expect the U.S. prime full impact of that, which will be around 100 basis points, obviously, a little bit into Q1, but most of it will come through in Q2. And then on the investment side or the non-loan asset side, on cash and short-term securities, those are mostly repriced. You'll recall that we have a sort of -- we manage our own liquidity, and we have a sort of 3-month T-Bill ladder, which tends to be set ahead of any Fed funds, obviously. So we've seen most of the impact there, but it could be another 15 to 25 basis points on cash and short-term securities. 
On the investment portfolio, some of that will depend on reinvestment rates, but I would expect some premium amortization, and to some extent, will depend on the CPT as well, which could be -- it's anyone's guess really, but we haven't seen accelerated prepayments yet, but it could be 5 to 15 basis points, call it, 10 basis points on investment portfolio over the next couple of quarters. And then offsetting that, obviously, we would expect a continued decline in the cost of deposits, not as much from demand because we're not yet charging negative rates on dollar deposits. But certainly on the term side, I would expect a further rollover benefit coming through the next couple of quarters. Most of that term money is really sitting in 3, 6 months, so it'll rollover into lower rates and probably generate an offset of about 10 to 15 basis points on the cost of deposits. 
So if you put all that together, over the next couple of quarters, you could see sort of a 25 to 35 basis point NIM compression. It will depend, to some extent, on loan demand in the market, both from what Michael spoke about in terms of government lending. It will also depend on where the tenure is. Currently, reinvestment rates in the $150 million range on MBS. And then obviously, the prepayment rates on MBS. So we're currently getting about $150 million to $200 million a quarter in maturities coming off that book. Again, if that obviously continues for a long period of time that will start to impact investment yields more meaningfully. But at the moment, we obviously bought that book to protect against interest rate risk in the banking book. We have an unrealized position now of $150 million in there. That will certainly help come through the coupons on the MBS securities over the next couple of years, and that was precisely why it's there in the first place."

And maybe on the expense side, the expense levels came in a lot lower than I think most people were expecting this quarter. I would have guessed that maybe given the delay in some of the integration in the Channel Islands that there may be -- the risk might be to the upside there, but it seems like you've taken some pretty good cost actions in the near term. I guess, can you just kind of walk us through near-term expectations on expenses? What sort of environmental impacts from the health crisis we might see on the expense line? What kind of cost cuts we could see? And then maybe any kind of tail impact of the integration of the Channel Islands deal in the third quarter, what impact that might have? I know that there's a lot of moving pieces there."

There's a corporate travel policy in mid-March. So that's one big expense item. When you operate these banks across multiple jurisdictions, obviously, there's a lot of travel, which is great. And obviously, client entertainment has also completely ceased at the moment or it's gone virtual at the moment, which obviously a lot less expensive. So we've seen a lot of benefit in the second part of March. And we would expect for that to continue to come down in the discretionary bucket. But again, that will be a short-term benefit. Coming out of lockdown, obviously, we'll start to gear up again. We are a relationship bank. And so it's important to -- for us to stay in touch with our customers, not just virtually, but also to spend time with them and understand what their business plans are, et cetera. 
On the more strategic side, obviously, we've taken action and deferred some of the capital spending programs, particularly around buildings, around brand rollout, resequenced that into a much slower burn rate at this point. We think we'd still obtain substantially the same benefits, but over a longer period of time. So people are not automatically getting new business cards, they're using the existing ones. We're not replacing the whole bins on the credit and debit cards, we're doing that gradually as cards expire, et cetera. We're -- we keep investing in the front line side of the business. So the branch refurb in Bermuda will still go ahead, which I think will be great. But some of the back office capital programs have been put on hold or are being reevaluated, as you would expect. 
Finally, I think amortization, as we talked about in the past as well, Butterfield built a very expensive system about 10 years ago, $120 million, which is -- the amortization is running off at the end of this quarter. And so moving into Q4, we would expect that to start helping. Effectively, that's $10 million annualized cost saving a year, of which we will put $2 million to $3 million back in, I expect, as part of normal system upgrades, et cetera, so net of $7 million there. And then obviously, depending on how long this goes on for, we'll need to look again more on a 0 basis or zero-based budgeting basis about -- I think it's been a bit of a reset for us. How many people do we need in the buildings, what do we really need to operate this business, et cetera. And so I'll just let Michael tune in on that."

So I think -- I mean, our focus, obviously, right now, the next quarter or 2 is just making sure everyone is safe and operating well and being supported. So lots of communication. I would say it's remarkable how we've been able to operate working remotely, which is a really interesting part of the model today. So today, across our 1,500 employees, we mentioned 70% are working remotely, 15% are at home not working, 15% are in the office. So if you could just take Bermuda as an example, we're operating full retail services where the operations with 59 people in the office out of about 500 and it's similar ratios across the different jurisdictions. So I think we are stepping back, and we're thinking about what the model should be and what the cost structure should be, assuming that we're going to be in a 0 interest rate environment for the long term. And so I think that has implications for a bank like Butterfield that's deposit led, and we understand that. So we're focused on what could the model look like as we come out of the pandemic. 
We have to be a little bit careful because while we're working remotely and things are operating very well, few client complaints at all, we have to recognize that volumes are way down as well. So we've got to sort of back test that to see how we could operate. But I think it is a real indication of a new working model that for a bank like Butterfield in very expensive jurisdictions, multiple currencies, multiple regulators, we are a pretty complex bank, and I think we're just going to do the work over the next quarter to see what a potential new cost structure model could look like. But first and foremost, the focus right now is, yes, do the work in the background, but at this point, we're here to support our employees as they service our client base."

So I guess how are you thinking about your ability to kind of serve as almost like a strategic acquirer at a time when a lot of global banks may be looking to exit and potentially raise capital?"

And what Butterfield did in the past in terms of lending and our entire model has been focused on just in-market lending, no out-of-market lending, no credit exposure in the investment portfolio. So that's really positioned us quite well. That's not to say we won't have some residential mortgage issues here as the economies will start to open up, but from a broader perspective, we positioned ourselves from a credit perspective for this sort of event. So I think we feel pretty confident on that side. And I think you're right. It's a little -- obviously, right now, given the environment, no one's really doing much of anything in terms of necessarily near-term corporate development. But I think we do really believe that things will open up as markets start to operate again. And as we said, we're a decent-sized bank in Guernsey at this point, so 10%, 15% market share; 1% or 2%, Jersey. We do think there's still going to be some opportunities there as U.K. banks start to strategically reposition. And Singapore, which is more or less shut down right now, but luckily, it's a trust company as opposed to a bank, is still a great market for us, and we just really need to find some scale. So we do think there's going to be opportunities. But I would temper it just by saying in the next few months, people are just trying to get through the situation they're in. But I think going into the summer, things -- discussions may open up at that point. But to your point, we are -- have a really healthy balance sheet, and we're strategically positioned to execute the strategy we've been talking about for years."

I think people are pretty nervous. We actually are seeing some more interest in our jurisdictions from an estate planning perspective. Again, it's driven by a handful of lawyers in New York, London and Miami. So we're seeing actually some really good inward connections in terms of possibly new trust. I think existing trust, it's -- I think really people focusing on making sure that the structures make sense, that the beneficiaries are right, that sort of thing. So it's sort of the day-to-day stuff we do anyway, but probably enhanced today. Yes, you could see some deposit weakness. So we have some very large trust clients. And I think as -- not so much pulling money out necessarily to sort of put in a box somewhere, it's really I think people are seeing real investment opportunities. And so I think people -- I think some of the larger trust clients will put some of that money to work, but we also expect it to sort of flow in and out.

Today's call and associated materials may also contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. 
On Slide 25 of the presentation, we have also included a list of potential factors relevant to the implications of COVID-19 for the bank. Additional information regarding these risks can be found in our SEC filings. 
I will now turn the call over to Michael Collins."

The bank's second quarter results were strong despite some of the challenges associated with COVID-19. As an essential service provider, the bank was able to support its clients throughout the health crisis with strict adherence to all recommended health and safety guidelines. We are grateful to our front-line staff who braved uncertainty to help keep our [indiscernible] economies operating and to our customers for their understanding as we temporarily transition to a remote working environment. I have been very impressed with the bank's operational resilience and our ability to quickly adjust to the new safety guidelines and social distancing rules relevant in each jurisdiction. 
As you can see in the summary results on Page 4 of the presentation, we reported net income of $34.3 million or $0.67 per share. In the second quarter, net income was 14.9% lower than the prior quarter due primarily to the COVID-19-related economic slowdown. 
Our core return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%, down from 18.6% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down 15 basis points to 2.48% and compared to the linked quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 28 basis points to 14 basis points. We believe our capital position and profitability remains strong. And as a result, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share, while we continue to repurchase shares throughout the quarter. 
During the quarter, we successfully issued $100 million of 5.25%, 10-year fixed to floating rate subordinated debt, which will mostly be used to replace existing debt. It is beneficial for the bank to be a known issuer in the debt capital market and the latest sub-debt issuance helps us to continue the dialogue with fixed income investors. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Butterfield operates in 10 locations with each jurisdiction managing through the health crisis relatively well at this point. In Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, the suppression of COVID has overall been effective. Bermuda was just entering its tourism season when the pandemic struck and the Island entered a mandatory shelter in place period for the month of April. The Island was essentially closed and has gradually reopened in May and June, with the airport opening on July 1. The number of flights are significantly below historical norms, but are expected to increase in August and into the fall. The cruise ship season is effectively lost, which will cost the government passenger fees and local businesses such as transportation companies, bars, restaurants and retailers will also miss out on significant revenue. With fewer flights to the island, hotels will also be impacted by the limited tourist season, which typically is most active through October. 
The timing of shutdowns in Cayman came toward the end of their 2019 tourism season. And they have been in their summer slow season, which has moderated the severity impact on the [indiscernible] economy so far. They're hoping to open their airport in the next couple of months as they approach the traditional autumn and winter tour season. The channel islands have had more COVID cases due to their proximity to the U.K. and France, but tourism is not a significant contributor to the economy compared to Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is approximately 17% and 25%, respectively. 
We've been making significant strides to help support our communities through these challenging times. In addition to local community-based programs, we have offered residential mortgage deferrals to clients and good standing in both Bermuda and Cayman for up to 6 months and 3-month interest-only options to small and medium-sized businesses. We are also working closely with larger corporate clients who may need to adjust terms of their loans and working capital requirements. We will continue to look at how we run our business in the near and longer term, reviewing costs and potential for new fee-generating opportunities with less reliance on interest rate-sensitive revenue sources. 
Butterfield's exposure to hotels and restaurants remain limited with well-structured loans and collateral packages in place. The remaining mortgage referrals expire in September after 6 months, and we will be keeping in close contact with clients, and we'll continue to work with customers who may need assistance. 
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details in the second quarter."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Looking now to Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest ra",926,"Thank you, Michael. Looking now to Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM. 
In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest rates pushed down floating rate loans and resulted in loan yields of 4.53%, down 27 basis points. Lower deposit costs did partly offset the lower asset yields. 
Looking now at Slide 8. Noninterest income was down 12.4% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to slower temporary economic activity during government-mandated lockdown periods. Banking fees fell as a result of lower card and merchant services fees. Foreign exchange commissions were also lower as activity was naturally subdued during the months of April and May. 
On Slide 9, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense, which was down 6.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While the first quarter of 2020 had some staff exit costs, including salaries and benefits, the second quarter benefited from lower costs related to consultants, travel, client entertainment and marketing. The core cost-to-income ratio was 66.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related revenue generation. We continue to target a through-cycle efficiency ratio of 60%, and expense management will be an important factor in a lower for longer interest rate period. 
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. We continue to maintain strong capital levels that are above regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 3.6% in the second quarter and is up 8.4% in the last 2 quarters. We view this as an important long-term value creation measure. In addition to the regular quarterly dividend, we have continued to repurchase shares during the quarter. As at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 950,000 shares remaining in our [ 3.5 million ] share repurchase authorization from December of 2019. In addition to supporting the dividend, buybacks and organic growth, we also continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. Turning now to Slide 
11. Butterfield's balance sheet has stabilized following the expected deposit declines from the ABN AMRO Channel Islands acquisition, deposits at 30 June, 2020, were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 1.2% from the end of the prior quarter. The lower deposit levels resulted primarily from the attrition of euro deposits in the channel islands. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 28 basis points to 14 basis points due to term deposit rollovers and further downward alignment of customer deposit rates. 
The balance sheet continues to be conservative and highly efficient with a low-risk density of 37.1% in terms of risk-weighted assets to total assets. 
On Slide 12, we provide more detail regarding residential mortgages by location, commercial loans by type and time line of mortgage deferral participation levels. In general, the bank's loans are manually underwritten by professionals with significant local market experience. 63% of loans are residential and the majority of those in Bermuda, Cayman and Central London. Approximately 80% of the bank's residential loans have an LTV of below 70%, and our commercial loans have an origination standard of below 65% LTV. 
As Michael mentioned earlier, one of the ways we've tried to alleviate the economic impact of COVID-19 on our communities was to offer mortgage deferral plans, which temporarily has put more money in people's pockets to assist recovery efforts. In the months of April through June, 85% of Bermuda and Cayman mortgage holders in good standing benefited from principal and interest payment deferrals with 15% of borrowers electing to continue with principal and interest payments. From July 1, customers had to opt-in if they wanted to continue with another 3 months of payment deferrals, of which approximately 50% have opted to participate. We have also offered small- and medium-sized businesses, the option of interest-only payments for the 3 months starting on April 1. Overall, these assistance programs have been really well received by customers. 
As you can see on Slide 13, Butterfield emphasizes low credit risk in its investment portfolio with 99% of our securities comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans did increase by $20 million in the quarter due to 1 C&I loan in collateral dispute litigation and a dozen or so mortgages that were not eligible for deferral at the end of the first quarter. We continue to work with the customers and difficulty during this time. 
During the second quarter, we increased our CECL estimate by $4.4 million, primarily in the consumer and commercial lending books. The increase is based on lower general economic forecast in the quarter. And the allowance for credit losses is now at $40.2 million or 79 basis points of total loans. 
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's duration and weighted average life of the securities portfolio has decreased in the second quarter due to lower U.S. interest rates, which caused higher prepayment speeds in our agency securities book. The sensitivity of the book has increased in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios. In the case of falling rates, we included the assumption that we would charge negative rates on deposits if rates go below 0. The bank's unrealized gains are currently at $180 million, up from $154 million at the end of the first quarter and $59 million at the end of 2019. We believe this will help moderate compression of the securities book yields in the years to come. 
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

I am delighted to be adding 2 highly experienced and competent financial professionals to our Board, which will now have 11 directors. These 2 new directors are on the slate for the scheduled AGM on August 12. Due to travel restrictions and health concerns around large group meetings in this new normal, the Board has decided to hold a virtual annual general meeting for 2020. Participation details for shareholders will be sent out shortly. 
As we manage through this period of change and uncertainty, we will continue to review all aspects of our businesses, products and jurisdictions to determine where we can improve efficiency. This will strengthen the Butterfield franchise to benefit all stakeholders and continue to provide industry-leading returns.

So I think -- I mean, looking at Q2, obviously, there's some temporary reductions just because we're obviously not out meeting with clients and attending events, et cetera. Travel clearly is very subdued at this point in time. And then tactically, we've also slowed down some of the brand rollout expenses to kind of lower the burn rate. You'll recall we redesigned the brand for Butterfield in 2019. That rollout schedule was originally quite compressed, and we've sort of move that out a bit to just use more internal resources really for that. 
If I look at sort of sequentially, if you wanted to normalize, last quarter, we sort of landed the final bit on the staffing levels following the ABN acquisition. So there was some severance costs and staff exit costs included there. So it was probably sort of too heavy last quarter, and it's probably -- if I think about this quarter and trying to normalize that, it's probably about $2 million light in terms of just temporarily reduced expenses on consultants travel and client entertainment, et cetera. So if you were thinking about normalizing, it's kind of that [ 84 ] number that we've talked about in the past, that's probably a good number to use."

It's worked really quite well even during the pandemic. So that's a great office, and we're to continue to build it. So that's longer term. 
Unfortunately, obviously, during this period, it's very difficult to actually execute some of those plans. But longer term, that's still going to be our focus, and it will continue to be a bigger office. Shorter term, near term, much more tactical. So obviously, Michael has mentioned, we're not traveling, no entertainment, so that actually helps a bit. We don't think that's going to come back to where it was before. So we'll continue to save money there. 
Temps and contractors. We're all over that in all of our jurisdictions when things are going well, you tend to add quite a bit of project to work and that's temps and contractors. So we're reducing that. And then structure and then unfortunately, headcount across all our jurisdictions. We're assuming we're in a 0 interest rate environment going forward. And I don't think any organization can continue with the model they practiced before, and we need to figure out how to operate more efficiently. 
So longer term, Halifax, shorter; near term, much more tactical, which we'll be talking to you about."

And so I think what that's taught us is what we've been doing in the last 5 to 10 years is really avoiding out of market lending. So the opportunities other than acquisitions we're thinking about are in the channel islands. So the acquisition of ABN gave us about $500 million of sort of private banking and small managed company corporate loans, and that's kind of what it our appetite. 
And looking at the Channel Islands, AA minus jurisdictions, predominantly financial services, not related -- not really sort of focused on tourism. Great opportunity, I think, to make, particularly Guernsey and possibly Jersey, look a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman to be full-service banks, sort of, high-end residential mortgages potentially. 
So we're still working through that, but we think there's an opportunity to do in market lending there as well and actually broaden out the product set to look more like Bermudan Cayman. So that's what I was referring to."

I think the Bermuda has been a bit slower to get back to work. Generally, if you look at government statistics for unemployment, et cetera, so I think it's had the desired effect. It was nice to see the participation rate drop and a number of people saying, look, this is fine. I can stop paying again. But I have no doubt that there will be a need for us to assist customers even after the 6 months, and there will be some that perhaps are going to miss going into the winter season in Bermuda, in particular, missed their ability to service their loans, and we'll have to work with those customers on different solutions. I mean we still have have the playbooks from the last financial crisis in terms of TDRs, et cetera. So I think we know what to do.

Just overall, obviously, we had about $20 million or so roughly going to NAL. And it's a pretty simple story. It's -- half of it's basically 1 commercial facility that was really sort of more of a private banking-type structured loan that has lots of collateral, but unfortunately, has various entities who are sort of going after that collateral. So it's overcollateralized, there's a situation that we need to work through, but we still think that there's plenty of collateral there. But that's the 1 commercial loan. The other half of the $20 million or so was a handful of residential mortgages. 
And just to start off, I would say we do expect residential mortgages in terms of 30-day delinquencies and 90-day NALs to increase. I mean, obviously, we're going into the winter season after not having a tourism season, particularly in in Bermuda. So we think that weakness will definitely be in Bermuda, not so much Cayman and the Channel Islands. So we do want to put that out there, but I would say, because we had this deferral program, which was really almost automatic for the Q2. We typically usually have a high cure rate. So we have a good team that basically dials for dollars and calls people. It's a small community. We know people, and it's really trying to get -- convince them to pay us versus other creditors potentially. And we usually do a good job. 
During Q2, during the lock down, obviously, we weren't doing that. It would be inappropriate to be calling people at home when they can't even be working. So I think some of the mortgage on accruals. Most of those facilities were already having trouble sort of 30-day delinquencies. And I think they used the period where no one else was paying to sort of say, okay, I won't pay this. This month, and that was during -- basically, the lockdown. So we think that was partially driven by that. But I would say, we have to look at the economy. Bermuda is shrinking and we do think we're going to have some residential mortgage issues. But the great news in our book is we're 63% residential mortgages. So again, coming into the crisis, we don't have a lot of hospitality, tourism loans. The hotel loans are really well underwritten, only $7 million of restaurant loans. And the commercial loans are all office buildings supported by reinsurance company leases. So it's a good problem to have. I think it's a residential mortgage problem. It's granular, but that will tick up, we think."

On the resi side, really folks were already kind of 30 days past due. And you can see that in Note 6, if you look at the rating migration down the track there.

Obviously, during the opt in, we've collected notes from people that we've called and talked to during opt in. And so far, most people look ready to come back and pay their mortgages. So some uncertainty, but not a big concern, I would say."

The initiative in the Channel Islands in terms of high-end private banking, residential mortgages is organic. So we hire a team. We understand the market, we start slowly, so that will ramp up over time. 
I would just look at it. So basically, the London mortgages, which is about $1 billion Sterling Central London, now are funded from Sterling deposits in Guernsey and Jersey. And this is just another in market lending opportunity for those 2 banks using their Sterling deposits."

So not really bad borrowers, but clearly struggling off and on with 1 or 2 people working. So that's really that group right there. 
And so I think when we did automatic deferral, I think it gave them an opportunity to say, okay, well, no one else is paying, and I'm not paying.

So there's a bit more pressure coming through on the resi side next quarter, call it, to a couple of handful of basis points on the resi side just from a full quarter impact. 
Obviously, the investment portfolio will depend on where prepayment speeds go at the moment. We don't have a lot of premium amortization in network, but prepayment speeds are probably in the high -- in the high teens coming into the second quarter, which is up quite materially. So we're getting a lot more maturities coming through with lower reinvestment rates, which is driving duration in but if you think about that from an annualized basis, and you think about the $180 million positive mark-to-market, which is going to come through the asset yield on the investment side, that kind of blends back to 20, 30 basis points a year as long as interest rates are where they are today. So I think we've seen most of the effects on the loan asset yield come through this quarter. 
On the deposit side, for the first quarter, our interest-bearing demand deposits were actually yielding negative, partly because the balance is strong and partly because the euros were repriced down. So we had negative 12 basis points actually on that, which drove down the average cost of deposits. And then the rollovers are going to come through in a 3-, 6-month bucket. So there's a bit more a bit more benefit to come through in the short-term as well, while those rollovers, repricing to lower rates. 
So I think overall, you could see by 5 to 15 basis points in the near term, and then it should stabilize. And as we then start to ladder out, the ABN deposits into investment securities. Now that we have a year's worth of data, we should see some pickup on the overall NIM, about probably about 40 basis points, and we'll probably ladder that out $100 million a quarter for the next 6 quarters or so. That will help a little bit, again, offset some of the compression in the near term, and then it should kind of start to turn a little bit."

The bank's second quarter results were strong despite some of the challenges associated with COVID-19. As an essential service provider, the bank was able to support its clients throughout the health crisis with strict adherence to all recommended health and strict safety guidelines. We are grateful to our frontline staff who braved uncertainty to help keep our island economies operating, and to our customers for their understanding as we temporarily transition to a remote working environment. I have been very impressed with the bank's operational resilience and our ability to quickly adjust to the new safety guidelines and social distancing rules relevant in each jurisdiction.  
As you can see in the summary results on Page 4 of the presentation, we reported net income of $34.3 million or $0.67 per share. In the second quarter, net income was 14.9% lower than the prior quarter due primarily to the COVID-19-related economic slowdown.  
Our core return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%, down from 18.6% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down 15 basis points to 2.48% compared to the linked quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 28 basis points to 14 basis points. We believe our capital position and profitability remains strong. And as a result, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share, while we continue to repurchase shares throughout the quarter.  
During the quarter, we successfully issued $100 million of 5.25%, 10-year fixed to floating rate subordinated debt, which will mostly be used to replace existing debt. It is beneficial for the bank to be a known issuer in the debt capital market, and the latest sub-debt issuance helps us to continue the dialogue with fixed income investors.  
Turning now to Slide 5. Butterfield operates in 10 locations with each jurisdiction managing through the health crisis relatively well at this point. In Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, the suppression of COVID has overall been effective. Bermuda was just entering its tourism season when the pandemic struck, and the Island entered a mandatory shelter-in-place period for the month of April. The Island was essentially closed and has gradually reopened in May and June with the airport opening on July 1. The number of flights are significantly below historical norms, but are expected to increase in August and into the fall. The cruise ship season is effectively lost, which will cost the government passenger fees. And local businesses such as transportation companies, bars, restaurants and retailers will also miss out on significant revenue. With fewer flights to the island, hotels will also be impacted by the limited tourist season, which typically is most active through October. 
The timing of shutdowns in Cayman came toward the end of their 2019 tourism season. And they have been in their summer slow season, which has moderated the severity impact on their bare economy so far. They're hoping to open their airport in the next couple of months as they approach the traditional autumn and winter tourism season. The Channel Islands have had more COVID cases due to their proximity to the U.K. and France, but tourism is not a significant contributor to the economy compared to Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is approximately 17% and 25%, respectively.  
We've been making significant strides to help support our communities through these challenging times. In addition to local community-based programs, we have offered residential mortgage deferrals to clients in good standing in both Bermuda and Cayman for up to 6 months. And 3-month interest-only options to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also working closely with larger corporate clients who may need to adjust terms of their loans and working capital requirements. We will continue to look at how we run our business in the near and longer term, reviewing costs and potential for new fee-generating opportunities with less reliance on interest rate-sensitive revenue sources.  
Butterfield's exposure to hotels and restaurants remain limited with well-structured loans and collateral packages in place. The remaining mortgage referrals expire in September after 6 months, and we will be keeping in close contact with clients, and we'll continue to work with customers who may need assistance.  
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the second quarter."

In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest r",922,"Thank you, Michael. Looking now to Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM.  
In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest rates pushed down floating rate loans and resulted in loan yields of 4.53%, down 27 basis points. Lower deposit costs did partly offset the lower asset yields.  
Looking now at Slide 8. Noninterest income was down 12.4% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to slower temporary economic activity during government-mandated lockdown periods. Banking fees fell as a result of lower card and merchant services fees. Foreign exchange commissions were also lower as activity was naturally subdued during the months of April and May.  
On Slide 9, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense, which was down 6.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While the first quarter of 2020 had some staff exit costs, including salaries and benefits, the second quarter benefited from lower costs related to consultants, travel, client entertainment and marketing. The core cost-to-income ratio was 66.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related revenue generation. We continue to target a through-cycle efficiency ratio of 60%, and expense management will be an important factor in a lower-for-longer interest rate period.  
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. We continue to maintain strong capital levels that are above regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 3.6% in the second quarter and is up 8.4% in the last 2 quarters. We view this as an important long-term value creation measure. In addition to the regular quarterly dividend, we have continued to repurchase shares during the quarter. As at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 950,000 shares remaining in our 3.5 million share repurchase authorization from December 2019. In addition to supporting the dividend, buybacks and organic growth, we also continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Butterfield's balance sheet has stabilized following the expected deposit declines from the ABN AMRO (Channel Islands) acquisition, deposits at 30 June 2020 were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 1.2% from the end of the prior quarter. The lower deposit levels resulted primarily from the attrition of euro deposits in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 28 basis points to 14 basis points due to term deposit rollovers and further downward alignment of customer deposit rates. The balance sheet continues to be conservative and highly efficient with a low risk density of 37.1% in terms of risk-weighted assets to total assets.  
On Slide 12, we provide more detail regarding residential mortgages by location, commercial loans by type and time line of mortgage deferral participation levels. In general, the bank's loans are manually underwritten by professionals with significant local market experience. 63% of loans are residential and the majority of those in Bermuda, Cayman and Central London. Approximately 80% of the bank's residential loans have an LTV of below 70%, and our commercial loans have an origination standard of below 65% LTV.  
As Michael mentioned earlier, one of the ways we've tried to alleviate the economic impact of COVID-19 on our communities was to offer mortgage deferral plans, which temporarily has put more money in people's pockets to assist recovery efforts. In the months of April through June, 85% of Bermuda and Cayman mortgage holders in good standing benefited from principal and interest payment deferrals with 15% of borrowers electing to continue with principal and interest payments. From July 1, customers had to opt-in if they wanted to continue with another 3 months of payment deferrals, of which approximately 50% have opted to participate. We have also offered small- and medium-sized businesses, the option of interest-only payments for the 3 months starting on April 1. Overall, these assistance programs have been really well received by customers.  
As you can see on Slide 13, Butterfield emphasizes low credit risk in its investment portfolio with 99% of our securities comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans did increase by $20 million in the quarter due to 1 C&I loan in collateral dispute litigation, and a dozen or so mortgages that were not eligible for deferral at the end of the first quarter. We continue to work with the customers in difficulty during this time. During the second quarter, we increased our CECL estimate by $4.4 million, primarily in the consumer and commercial lending books. The increase is based on lower general economic forecast in the quarter. And the allowance for credit losses is now at $40.2 million or 79 basis points of total loans.  
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's duration and weighted average life of the securities portfolio has decreased in the second quarter due to lower U.S. interest rates, which caused higher prepayment speeds in our agency securities book. The sensitivity of the book has increased in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios. In the case of falling rates, we included the assumption that we would charge negative rates on deposits if rates go below 0. The bank's unrealized gains are currently at $180 million, up from $154 million at the end of the first quarter and $59 million at the end of 2019. We believe this will help moderate compression of the securities book yields in the years to come.  
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

The first is Leslie Godridge, who has over 40 years of financial experience, and was most recently at U.S. Bancorp, where she was Vice Chairman, Director, U.S. Bank NA; and Co-Head, Corporate and Commercial Banking, following a number of years in senior positions at Bank of New York. The Board will also be joined by Jana Schreuder, who has recently retired as Chief Operating Officer of Northern Trust Corporation after a career, which began at Northern Trust in 1980. I am delighted to be adding 2 highly experienced and competent financial professionals to our Board, which will now have 11 directors. These 2 new directors are on the slate for the scheduled AGM on August 12. Due to travel restrictions and health concerns around large group meetings in this new normal, the Board has decided to hold a virtual Annual General Meeting for 2020. Participation details for shareholders will be sent out shortly.  
As we manage through this period of change and uncertainty, we will continue to review all aspects of our businesses, products and jurisdictions to determine where we can improve efficiency. This will strengthen the Butterfield franchise to benefit all stakeholders and continue to provide industry-leading returns.

So I think -- I mean looking at Q2, obviously, there's some temporary reductions just because we're obviously not out meeting with clients and attending events, et cetera. Travel clearly is very subdued at this point in time. And then tactically, we've also slowed down some of the brand rollout expenses to kind of lower the burn rate. You'll recall we redesigned the brand for Butterfield in 2019. That rollout schedule was originally quite compressed, and we've sort of moved that out a bit to just use more internal resources really for that. If I look at sort of sequentially, if we wanted to normalize, last quarter, we sort of landed the final bit on the staffing levels following the ABN acquisition. So there was some severance costs and staff exit costs included there. So it was probably sort of too heavy last quarter. And it's probably -- if I think about this quarter and trying to normalize that, it's probably about $2 million light in terms of just temporarily reduced expenses on consultants travel and client entertainment, et cetera. So if you were thinking about normalizing, it's kind of that $84  million number that we've talked about in the past, that's probably a good number to use."

It's worked really quite well even during the pandemic. So that's a great office, and we're going to continue to build it. So that's longer term.  
Unfortunately, obviously, during this period, it's very difficult to actually execute some of those plans. But longer term, that's still going to be our focus, and it will continue to be a bigger office. Shorter term, near term, much more tactical. So obviously, Michael has mentioned, we're not traveling, no entertainment, so that actually helps a bit. We don't think that's going to come back to where it was before. So we'll continue to save money there.  
Temps and contractors. We're all over that in all of our jurisdictions. When things are going well, you tend to add quite a bit of project work and that's temps and contractors. So we're reducing that. And then structure and then, unfortunately, headcount across all our jurisdictions. We're assuming we're in a 0 interest rate environment going forward. And I don't think any organization can continue with the model they practiced before, and we need to figure out how to operate more efficiently. So longer term, Halifax, shorter and near term, much more tactical, which we'll be talking to you about."

And so I think what that's taught us is what we've been doing in the last 5 to 10 years is really avoiding out of market lending. So the opportunities other than acquisitions we're thinking about are in the Channel Islands. So the acquisition of ABN gave us about $500 million of sort of private banking and small managed company corporate loans, and that's kind of what is our appetite. And looking at the Channel Islands, AA-minus jurisdictions, predominantly financial services, not related -- not really sort of focused on tourism, great opportunity, I think, to make, particularly Guernsey and possibly Jersey, look a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman to be full-service banks, sort of high-end residential mortgages potentially.  
So we're still working through that, but we think there's an opportunity to do in-market lending there as well. And actually broaden out the product set to look more like Bermuda and Cayman. So that's what I was referring to."

Obviously, we're collecting -- we're pleased to see the participation rate drops, obviously, for the second one. And again, a slight differentiation between probably Cayman and Bermuda where Bermuda had a slightly higher participation rate in the second round than Cayman. I think Bermuda has been a bit slower to get back to work, generally, if you look at government statistics for unemployment, et cetera. So I think it's had the desired effect. It was nice to see the participation rate drop, and a number of people saying, ""Look, this is fine, I can stop paying again."" But I have no doubt that there will be a need for us to assist customers even after the 6 months, and there will be some that perhaps are going to miss going into the winter season. And Bermuda, in particular, missed their ability to service their loans, and we'll have to work with those customers on different solutions. I mean we still have the playbooks from the last financial crisis in terms of TDRs, et cetera. So I think we know what to do.

Just overall, obviously, we had about $20 million or so roughly going to NAL. And it's a pretty simple story. It's -- half of it's basically 1 commercial facility that was really sort of more of a private banking-type structured loan. That has lots of collateral, but unfortunately, has various entities who are sort of going after that collateral. So it's overcollateralized, there's a situation that we need to work through, but we still think that there's plenty of collateral there. But that's the 1 commercial loan. The other half of the $20 million or so was a handful of residential mortgages.  
And just to start off, I would say we do expect residential mortgages in terms of 30-day delinquencies and 90-day NALs to increase. I mean, obviously, we're going into the winter season after not having a tourism season, particularly in Bermuda. So we think that weakness will definitely be in Bermuda, not so much Cayman and not the Channel Islands. So we do want to put that out there. But I would say, because we had this deferral program, which was really almost automatic for Q2, we typically have a -- usually have a high cure rate. So we have a good team that basically dials for dollars and calls people. It's a small community. We know people, and it's really trying to get -- convince them to pay us versus other creditors, potentially. And we usually do a good job. During Q2, during the lockdown, obviously, we weren't doing that. It would be inappropriate to be calling people at home when they can't even be working. 
So I think some of the mortgage on accruals, most of those facilities were already having trouble sort of 30-day delinquencies. And I think they used the period where no one else was paying to sort of say, ""Okay, I won't pay this, this month."" And that was during, basically, the lockdown. So we think that was partially driven by that. But I would say we have to look at the economy. Bermuda is shrinking, and we do think we're going to have some residential mortgage issues. But the great news in our book is we're 63% residential mortgages. So again, coming into the crisis, we don't have a lot of hospitality, tourism loans. The hotel loans are really well underwritten, only $7 million of restaurant loans. And the commercial loans are all office buildings supported by reinsurance company leases. So it's a good problem to have. I think it's a residential mortgage problem. It's granular, but that will tick up, we think."

It's just going to kind of work its way through.  
On the resi side, really folks were already kind of 30 days past due. And you can see that in Note 6, if you look at the rating migration down the track there. We're obviously not expecting anything to come through next quarter just because of the deferral program. So ultimately, as Michael said, in Q4, will be kind of when we know the fuller picture.  
Obviously, during the opt-in, we've collected notes from people that we've called and talked to during the opt-in. And so far, most people look ready to come back and pay their mortgages. So some uncertainty, but not a big concern, I would say."

So, I mean, I would say, Cayman is less than 1%, 30-day delinquencies right now. So a different environment.

It's a pool of mortgages that's kind of in and out of 30-day delinquencies. So we know who they are. They're not 90 days. They get 45 days, and then they get some cash and they pay it. So not really bad borrowers, but clearly struggling off and on with 1 or 2 people working. So that's really that group right there. 
And so I think when we did automatic deferral, I think it gave them an opportunity to say, ""Okay, well, no one else is paying, and I'm not paying."" We didn't allow them an automatic deferral because we put them out because they were 30-day delinquent. So they already had issues.

So there's a bit more pressure coming through on the resi side next quarter, call it, a couple of handful of basis points on the resi side just from a full quarter impact. 
Obviously, the investment portfolio will depend on where prepayment speeds go at the moment. We don't have a lot of premium amortization in that book. But prepayment speeds are probably in the high teens coming into the second quarter, which is up quite materially. So we're getting a lot more maturities coming through with lower reinvestment rates, which is driving duration in. But if you think about that from an annualized basis, and you think about the $180 million positive mark-to-market, which is going to come through the asset yield on the investment side, that kind of blends back to 20, 30 basis points a year as long as interest rates are where they are today. So I think we've seen most of the effects on the loan asset yield come through this quarter. 
On the deposit side, for the first quarter, our interest-bearing demand deposits were actually yielding negative, partly because the balance is strong and partly because the euros were repriced down. So we had negative 12 basis points actually on that, which drove down the average cost of deposits. And then the rollovers are going to come through in a 3-, 6-month bucket. So there's a bit more a bit more benefit to come through in the short-term as well, while those rollovers reprice into lower rates. 
So I think overall, you could see 5 to 15 basis points in the near term, and then it should stabilize. And as we then start to ladder out, the ABN deposits into investment securities. Now that we have a year's worth of data, we should see some pickup on the overall NIM, about -- probably about 40 basis points, and we'll probably ladder that out $100 million a quarter for the next 6 quarters or so. That will help a little bit, again, offset some of the compression in the near term, and then it should kind of start to turn a little bit."

The bank's second quarter results were strong despite some of the challenges associated with COVID-19. As an essential service provider, the bank was able to support its clients throughout the health crisis with strict adherence to all recommended health and strict safety guidelines. We are grateful to our frontline staff who braved uncertainty to help keep our island economies operating, and to our customers for their understanding as we temporarily transition to a remote working environment. I have been very impressed with the bank's operational resilience and our ability to quickly adjust to the new safety guidelines and social distancing rules relevant in each jurisdiction.  
As you can see in the summary results on Page 4 of the presentation, we reported net income of $34.3 million or $0.67 per share. In the second quarter, net income was 14.9% lower than the prior quarter due primarily to the COVID-19-related economic slowdown.  
Our core return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%, down from 18.6% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down 15 basis points to 2.48% compared to the linked quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 28 basis points to 14 basis points. We believe our capital position and profitability remains strong. And as a result, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share, while we continue to repurchase shares throughout the quarter.  
During the quarter, we successfully issued $100 million of 5.25%, 10-year fixed to floating rate subordinated debt, which will mostly be used to replace existing debt. It is beneficial for the bank to be a known issuer in the debt capital market, and the latest sub-debt issuance helps us to continue the dialogue with fixed income investors.  
Turning now to Slide 5. Butterfield operates in 10 locations with each jurisdiction managing through the health crisis relatively well at this point. In Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, the suppression of COVID has overall been effective. Bermuda was just entering its tourism season when the pandemic struck, and the Island entered a mandatory shelter-in-place period for the month of April. The Island was essentially closed and has gradually reopened in May and June with the airport opening on July 1. The number of flights are significantly below historical norms, but are expected to increase in August and into the fall. The cruise ship season is effectively lost, which will cost the government passenger fees. And local businesses such as transportation companies, bars, restaurants and retailers will also miss out on significant revenue. With fewer flights to the island, hotels will also be impacted by the limited tourist season, which typically is most active through October. 
The timing of shutdowns in Cayman came toward the end of their 2019 tourism season. And they have been in their summer slow season, which has moderated the severity impact on their bare economy so far. They're hoping to open their airport in the next couple of months as they approach the traditional autumn and winter tourism season. The Channel Islands have had more COVID cases due to their proximity to the U.K. and France, but tourism is not a significant contributor to the economy compared to Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is approximately 17% and 25%, respectively.  
We've been making significant strides to help support our communities through these challenging times. In addition to local community-based programs, we have offered residential mortgage deferrals to clients in good standing in both Bermuda and Cayman for up to 6 months. And 3-month interest-only options to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also working closely with larger corporate clients who may need to adjust terms of their loans and working capital requirements. We will continue to look at how we run our business in the near and longer term, reviewing costs and potential for new fee-generating opportunities with less reliance on interest rate-sensitive revenue sources.  
Butterfield's exposure to hotels and restaurants remain limited with well-structured loans and collateral packages in place. The remaining mortgage referrals expire in September after 6 months, and we will be keeping in close contact with clients, and we'll continue to work with customers who may need assistance.  
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the second quarter."

In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest r",922,"Thank you, Michael. Looking now to Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM.  
In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest rates pushed down floating rate loans and resulted in loan yields of 4.53%, down 27 basis points. Lower deposit costs did partly offset the lower asset yields.  
Looking now at Slide 8. Noninterest income was down 12.4% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to slower temporary economic activity during government-mandated lockdown periods. Banking fees fell as a result of lower card and merchant services fees. Foreign exchange commissions were also lower as activity was naturally subdued during the months of April and May.  
On Slide 9, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense, which was down 6.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While the first quarter of 2020 had some staff exit costs, including salaries and benefits, the second quarter benefited from lower costs related to consultants, travel, client entertainment and marketing. The core cost-to-income ratio was 66.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related revenue generation. We continue to target a through-cycle efficiency ratio of 60%, and expense management will be an important factor in a lower-for-longer interest rate period.  
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. We continue to maintain strong capital levels that are above regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 3.6% in the second quarter and is up 8.4% in the last 2 quarters. We view this as an important long-term value creation measure. In addition to the regular quarterly dividend, we have continued to repurchase shares during the quarter. As at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 950,000 shares remaining in our 3.5 million share repurchase authorization from December 2019. In addition to supporting the dividend, buybacks and organic growth, we also continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Butterfield's balance sheet has stabilized following the expected deposit declines from the ABN AMRO (Channel Islands) acquisition, deposits at 30 June 2020 were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 1.2% from the end of the prior quarter. The lower deposit levels resulted primarily from the attrition of euro deposits in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 28 basis points to 14 basis points due to term deposit rollovers and further downward alignment of customer deposit rates. The balance sheet continues to be conservative and highly efficient with a low risk density of 37.1% in terms of risk-weighted assets to total assets.  
On Slide 12, we provide more detail regarding residential mortgages by location, commercial loans by type and time line of mortgage deferral participation levels. In general, the bank's loans are manually underwritten by professionals with significant local market experience. 63% of loans are residential and the majority of those in Bermuda, Cayman and Central London. Approximately 80% of the bank's residential loans have an LTV of below 70%, and our commercial loans have an origination standard of below 65% LTV.  
As Michael mentioned earlier, one of the ways we've tried to alleviate the economic impact of COVID-19 on our communities was to offer mortgage deferral plans, which temporarily has put more money in people's pockets to assist recovery efforts. In the months of April through June, 85% of Bermuda and Cayman mortgage holders in good standing benefited from principal and interest payment deferrals with 15% of borrowers electing to continue with principal and interest payments. From July 1, customers had to opt-in if they wanted to continue with another 3 months of payment deferrals, of which approximately 50% have opted to participate. We have also offered small- and medium-sized businesses, the option of interest-only payments for the 3 months starting on April 1. Overall, these assistance programs have been really well received by customers.  
As you can see on Slide 13, Butterfield emphasizes low credit risk in its investment portfolio with 99% of our securities comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans did increase by $20 million in the quarter due to 1 C&I loan in collateral dispute litigation, and a dozen or so mortgages that were not eligible for deferral at the end of the first quarter. We continue to work with the customers in difficulty during this time. During the second quarter, we increased our CECL estimate by $4.4 million, primarily in the consumer and commercial lending books. The increase is based on lower general economic forecast in the quarter. And the allowance for credit losses is now at $40.2 million or 79 basis points of total loans.  
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's duration and weighted average life of the securities portfolio has decreased in the second quarter due to lower U.S. interest rates, which caused higher prepayment speeds in our agency securities book. The sensitivity of the book has increased in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios. In the case of falling rates, we included the assumption that we would charge negative rates on deposits if rates go below 0. The bank's unrealized gains are currently at $180 million, up from $154 million at the end of the first quarter and $59 million at the end of 2019. We believe this will help moderate compression of the securities book yields in the years to come.  
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

You may have seen in our recently filed AGM proxy statement that the bank is proposing to add 2 new directors. The first is Leslie Godridge, who has over 40 years of financial experience, and was most recently at U.S. Bancorp, where she was Vice Chairman, Director, U.S. Bank NA; and Co-Head, Corporate and Commercial Banking, following a number of years in senior positions at Bank of New York. The Board will also be joined by Jana Schreuder, who has recently retired as Chief Operating Officer of Northern Trust Corporation after a career, which began at Northern Trust in 1980. I am delighted to be adding 2 highly experienced and competent financial professionals to our Board, which will now have 11 directors. These 2 new directors are on the slate for the scheduled AGM on August 12. Due to travel restrictions and health concerns around large group meetings in this new normal, the Board has decided to hold a virtual Annual General Meeting for 2020. Participation details for shareholders will be sent out shortly.  
As we manage through this period of change and uncertainty, we will continue to review all aspects of our businesses, products and jurisdictions to determine where we can improve efficiency. This will strengthen the Butterfield franchise to benefit all stakeholders and continue to provide industry-leading returns.  
Thank you. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I think -- I mean looking at Q2, obviously, there's some temporary reductions just because we're obviously not out meeting with clients and attending events, et cetera. Travel clearly is very subdued at this point in time. And then tactically, we've also slowed down some of the brand rollout expenses to kind of lower the burn rate. You'll recall we redesigned the brand for Butterfield in 2019. That rollout schedule was originally quite compressed, and we've sort of moved that out a bit to just use more internal resources really for that. If I look at sort of sequentially, if we wanted to normalize, last quarter, we sort of landed the final bit on the staffing levels following the ABN acquisition. So there was some severance costs and staff exit costs included there. So it was probably sort of too heavy last quarter. And it's probably -- if I think about this quarter and trying to normalize that, it's probably about $2 million light in terms of just temporarily reduced expenses on consultants travel and client entertainment, et cetera. So if you were thinking about normalizing, it's kind of that $84  million number that we've talked about in the past, that's probably a good number to use."

Unfortunately, obviously, during this period, it's very difficult to actually execute some of those plans. But longer term, that's still going to be our focus, and it will continue to be a bigger office. Shorter term, near term, much more tactical. So obviously, Michael has mentioned, we're not traveling, no entertainment, so that actually helps a bit. We don't think that's going to come back to where it was before. So we'll continue to save money there.  
Temps and contractors. We're all over that in all of our jurisdictions. When things are going well, you tend to add quite a bit of project work and that's temps and contractors. So we're reducing that. And then structure and then, unfortunately, headcount across all our jurisdictions. We're assuming we're in a 0 interest rate environment going forward. And I don't think any organization can continue with the model they practiced before, and we need to figure out how to operate more efficiently. So longer term, Halifax, shorter and near term, much more tactical, which we'll be talking to you about."

And so I think what that's taught us is what we've been doing in the last 5 to 10 years is really avoiding out of market lending. So the opportunities other than acquisitions we're thinking about are in the Channel Islands. So the acquisition of ABN gave us about $500 million of sort of private banking and small managed company corporate loans, and that's kind of what is our appetite. And looking at the Channel Islands, AA-minus jurisdictions, predominantly financial services, not related -- not really sort of focused on tourism, great opportunity, I think, to make, particularly Guernsey and possibly Jersey, look a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman to be full-service banks, sort of high-end residential mortgages potentially.  
So we're still working through that, but we think there's an opportunity to do in-market lending there as well. And actually broaden out the product set to look more like Bermuda and Cayman. So that's what I was referring to."

I think Bermuda has been a bit slower to get back to work, generally, if you look at government statistics for unemployment, et cetera. So I think it's had the desired effect. It was nice to see the participation rate drop, and a number of people saying, ""Look, this is fine, I can stop paying again."" But I have no doubt that there will be a need for us to assist customers even after the 6 months, and there will be some that perhaps are going to miss going into the winter season. And Bermuda, in particular, missed their ability to service their loans, and we'll have to work with those customers on different solutions. I mean we still have the playbooks from the last financial crisis in terms of TDRs, et cetera. So I think we know what to do. It's still a little bit uncertain, but it's good to see the progress quarter-over-quarter."

Just overall, obviously, we had about $20 million or so roughly going to NAL. And it's a pretty simple story. It's -- half of it's basically one commercial facility that was really sort of more of a private banking-type structured loan. That has lots of collateral, but unfortunately, has various entities who are sort of going after that collateral. So it's overcollateralized, there's a situation that we need to work through, but we still think that there's plenty of collateral there. But that's the 1 commercial loan. The other half of the $20 million or so was a handful of residential mortgages.  
And just to start off, I would say we do expect residential mortgages in terms of 30-day delinquencies and 90-day NALs to increase. I mean, obviously, we're going into the winter season after not having a tourism season, particularly in Bermuda. So we think that weakness will definitely be in Bermuda, not so much Cayman and not the Channel Islands. So we do want to put that out there. But I would say, because we had this deferral program, which was really almost automatic for Q2, we typically have a -- usually have a high cure rate. So we have a good team that basically dials for dollars and calls people. It's a small community. We know people, and it's really trying to get -- convince them to pay us versus other creditors, potentially. And we usually do a good job. During Q2, during the lockdown, obviously, we weren't doing that. It would be inappropriate to be calling people at home when they can't even be working. 
So I think some of the mortgage on accruals, most of those facilities were already having trouble sort of 30-day delinquencies. And I think they used the period where no one else was paying to sort of say, ""Okay, I won't pay this, this month."" And that was during, basically, the lockdown. So we think that was partially driven by that. But I would say we have to look at the economy. Bermuda is shrinking, and we do think we're going to have some residential mortgage issues. But the great news in our book is we're 63% residential mortgages. So again, coming into the crisis, we don't have a lot of hospitality, tourism loans. The hotel loans are really well underwritten, only $7 million of restaurant loans. And the commercial loans are all office buildings supported by reinsurance company leases. So it's a good problem to have. I think it's a residential mortgage problem. It's granular, but that will tick up, we think."

It's just going to kind of work its way through.  
On the resi side, really folks were already kind of 30 days past due. And you can see that in Note 6, if you look at the rating migration down the track there. We're obviously not expecting anything to come through next quarter just because of the deferral program. So ultimately, as Michael said, in Q4, will be kind of when we know the fuller picture.  
Obviously, during the opt-in, we've collected notes from people that we've called and talked to during the opt-in. And so far, most people look ready to come back and pay their mortgages. So some uncertainty, but not a big concern, I would say."

And so I think when we did automatic deferral, I think it gave them an opportunity to say, ""Okay, well, no one else is paying, and I'm not paying."" We didn't allow them an automatic deferral because we put them out because they were 30-day delinquent. So they already had issues. That's not to say other parts of the book aren't going to start to struggle, but that was kind of this group."

So there's a bit more pressure coming through on the resi side next quarter, call it, a couple of handful of basis points on the resi side just from a full quarter impact. 
Obviously, the investment portfolio will depend on where prepayment speeds go at the moment. We don't have a lot of premium amortization in that book. But prepayment speeds are probably in the high teens coming into the second quarter, which is up quite materially. So we're getting a lot more maturities coming through with lower reinvestment rates, which is driving duration in. But if you think about that from an annualized basis, and you think about the $180 million positive mark-to-market, which is going to come through the asset yield on the investment side, that kind of blends back to 20, 30 basis points a year as long as interest rates are where they are today. So I think we've seen most of the effects on the loan asset yield come through this quarter. 
On the deposit side, for the first quarter, our interest-bearing demand deposits were actually yielding negative, partly because the balance is strong and partly because the euros were repriced down. So we had negative 12 basis points actually on that, which drove down the average cost of deposits. And then the rollovers are going to come through in a 3-, 6-month bucket. So there's a bit more a bit more benefit to come through in the short-term as well, while those rollovers reprice into lower rates. 
So I think overall, you could see 5 to 15 basis points in the near term, and then it should stabilize. And as we then start to ladder out, the ABN deposits into investment securities. Now that we have a year's worth of data, we should see some pickup on the overall NIM, about -- probably about 40 basis points, and we'll probably ladder that out $100 million a quarter for the next 6 quarters or so. That will help a little bit, again, offset some of the compression in the near term, and then it should kind of start to turn a little bit."

The bank's second quarter results were strong despite some of the challenges associated with COVID-19. As an essential service provider, the bank was able to support its clients throughout the health crisis with strict adherence to all recommended health and strict safety guidelines. We are grateful to our frontline staff who braved uncertainty to help keep our island economies operating, and to our customers for their understanding as we temporarily transition to a remote working environment. I have been very impressed with the bank's operational resilience and our ability to quickly adjust to the new safety guidelines and social distancing rules relevant in each jurisdiction.  
As you can see in the summary results on Page 4 of the presentation, we reported net income of $34.3 million or $0.67 per share. In the second quarter, net income was 14.9% lower than the prior quarter due primarily to the COVID-19-related economic slowdown.  
Our core return on average tangible common equity was 15.5%, down from 18.6% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down 15 basis points to 2.48% compared to the linked quarter, and our cost of deposits dropped 28 basis points to 14 basis points. We believe our capital position and profitability remains strong. And as a result, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share, while we continue to repurchase shares throughout the quarter.  
During the quarter, we successfully issued $100 million of 5.25%, 10-year fixed to floating rate subordinated debt, which will mostly be used to replace existing debt. It is beneficial for the bank to be a known issuer in the debt capital market, and the latest sub-debt issuance helps us to continue the dialogue with fixed income investors.  
Turning now to Slide 5. Butterfield operates in 10 locations with each jurisdiction managing through the health crisis relatively well at this point. In Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, the suppression of COVID has overall been effective. Bermuda was just entering its tourism season when the pandemic struck, and the Island entered a mandatory shelter-in-place period for the month of April. The Island was essentially closed and has gradually reopened in May and June with the airport opening on July 1. The number of flights are significantly below historical norms, but are expected to increase in August and into the fall. The cruise ship season is effectively lost, which will cost the government passenger fees. And local businesses such as transportation companies, bars, restaurants and retailers will also miss out on significant revenue. With fewer flights to the island, hotels will also be impacted by the limited tourist season, which typically is most active through October. 
The timing of shutdowns in Cayman came toward the end of their 2019 tourism season. And they have been in their summer slow season, which has moderated the severity impact on their bare economy so far. They're hoping to open their airport in the next couple of months as they approach the traditional autumn and winter tourism season. The Channel Islands have had more COVID cases due to their proximity to the U.K. and France, but tourism is not a significant contributor to the economy compared to Bermuda and Cayman, where tourism is approximately 17% and 25%, respectively.  
We've been making significant strides to help support our communities through these challenging times. In addition to local community-based programs, we have offered residential mortgage deferrals to clients in good standing in both Bermuda and Cayman for up to 6 months. And 3-month interest-only options to small- and medium-sized businesses. We are also working closely with larger corporate clients who may need to adjust terms of their loans and working capital requirements. We will continue to look at how we run our business in the near and longer term, reviewing costs and potential for new fee-generating opportunities with less reliance on interest rate-sensitive revenue sources.  
Butterfield's exposure to hotels and restaurants remain limited with well-structured loans and collateral packages in place. The remaining mortgage referrals expire in September after 6 months, and we will be keeping in close contact with clients, and we'll continue to work with customers who may need assistance.  
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the second quarter."

Looking now to Slide 7, we provide a summary of net interest income and NIM.  
In the second quarter, NIM of 2.48% was 15 basis points lower than the prior quarter as global interest rates fell across the yield curve. Lower interest rates pushed down floating rate loans and resulted in loan yields of 4.53%, down 27 basis points. Lower deposit costs did partly offset the lower asset yields.  
Looking now at Slide 8. Noninterest income was down 12.4% compared to the prior quarter due primarily to slower temporary economic activity during government-mandated lockdown periods. Banking fees fell as a result of lower card and merchant services fees. Foreign exchange commissions were also lower as activity was naturally subdued during the months of April and May.  
On Slide 9, we provide an overview of core noninterest expense, which was down 6.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. While the first quarter of 2020 had some staff exit costs, including salaries and benefits, the second quarter benefited from lower costs related to consultants, travel, client entertainment and marketing. The core cost-to-income ratio was 66.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19-related revenue generation. We continue to target a through-cycle efficiency ratio of 60%, and expense management will be an important factor in a lower-for-longer interest rate period.  
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. We continue to maintain strong capital levels that are above regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 3.6% in the second quarter and is up 8.4% in the last 2 quarters. We view this as an important long-term value creation measure. In addition to the regular quarterly dividend, we have continued to repurchase shares during the quarter. As at the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 950,000 shares remaining in our 3.5 million share repurchase authorization from December 2019. In addition to supporting the dividend, buybacks and organic growth, we also continue to evaluate M&A opportunities. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Butterfield's balance sheet has stabilized following the expected deposit declines from the ABN AMRO (Channel Islands) acquisition, deposits at 30 June 2020 were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 1.2% from the end of the prior quarter. The lower deposit levels resulted primarily from the attrition of euro deposits in the Channel Islands. Overall, the cost of deposits is down 28 basis points to 14 basis points due to term deposit rollovers and further downward alignment of customer deposit rates. The balance sheet continues to be conservative and highly efficient with a low risk density of 37.1% in terms of risk-weighted assets to total assets.  
On Slide 12, we provide more detail regarding residential mortgages by location, commercial loans by type and time line of mortgage deferral participation levels. In general, the bank's loans are manually underwritten by professionals with significant local market experience. 63% of loans are residential and the majority of those in Bermuda, Cayman and Central London. Approximately 80% of the bank's residential loans have an LTV of below 70%, and our commercial loans have an origination standard of below 65% LTV.  
As Michael mentioned earlier, one of the ways we've tried to alleviate the economic impact of COVID-19 on our communities was to offer mortgage deferral plans, which temporarily has put more money in people's pockets to assist recovery efforts. In the months of April through June, 85% of Bermuda and Cayman mortgage holders in good standing benefited from principal and interest payment deferrals with 15% of borrowers electing to continue with principal and interest payments. From July 1, customers had to opt-in if they wanted to continue with another 3 months of payment deferrals, of which approximately 50% have opted to participate. We have also offered small- and medium-sized businesses, the option of interest-only payments for the 3 months starting on April 1. Overall, these assistance programs have been really well received by customers.  
As you can see on Slide 13, Butterfield emphasizes low credit risk in its investment portfolio with 99% of our securities comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans did increase by $20 million in the quarter due to 1 C&I loan in collateral dispute litigation, and a dozen or so mortgages that were not eligible for deferral at the end of the first quarter. We continue to work with the customers in difficulty during this time. During the second quarter, we increased our CECL estimate by $4.4 million, primarily in the consumer and commercial lending books. The increase is based on lower general economic forecast in the quarter. And the allowance for credit losses is now at $40.2 million or 79 basis points of total loans.  
On Slide 14, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's duration and weighted average life of the securities portfolio has decreased in the second quarter due to lower U.S. interest rates, which caused higher prepayment speeds in our agency securities book. The sensitivity of the book has increased in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios. In the case of falling rates, we included the assumption that we would charge negative rates on deposits if rates go below 0. The bank's unrealized gains are currently at $180 million, up from $154 million at the end of the first quarter and $59 million at the end of 2019. We believe this will help moderate compression of the securities book yields in the years to come.  
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

So I think -- I mean looking at Q2, obviously, there's some temporary reductions just because we're obviously not out meeting with clients and attending events, et cetera. Travel clearly is very subdued at this point in time. And then tactically, we've also slowed down some of the brand rollout expenses to kind of lower the burn rate. You'll recall we redesigned the brand for Butterfield in 2019. That rollout schedule was originally quite compressed, and we've sort of moved that out a bit to just use more internal resources really for that. If I look at sort of sequentially, if we wanted to normalize, last quarter, we sort of landed the final bit on the staffing levels following the ABN acquisition. So there was some severance costs and staff exit costs included there. So it was probably sort of too heavy last quarter. And it's probably -- if I think about this quarter and trying to normalize that, it's probably about $2 million light in terms of just temporarily reduced expenses on consultants travel and client entertainment, et cetera. So if you were thinking about normalizing, it's kind of that $84  million number that we've talked about in the past, that's probably a good number to use."

It's worked really quite well even during the pandemic. So that's a great office, and we're going to continue to build it. So that's longer term.  
Unfortunately, obviously, during this period, it's very difficult to actually execute some of those plans. But longer term, that's still going to be our focus, and it will continue to be a bigger office. Shorter term, near term, much more tactical. So obviously, Michael has mentioned, we're not traveling, no entertainment, so that actually helps a bit. We don't think that's going to come back to where it was before. So we'll continue to save money there.  
Temps and contractors. We're all over that in all of our jurisdictions. When things are going well, you tend to add quite a bit of project work and that's temps and contractors. So we're reducing that. And then structure and then, unfortunately, headcount across all our jurisdictions. We're assuming we're in a 0 interest rate environment going forward. And I don't think any organization can continue with the model they practiced before, and we need to figure out how to operate more efficiently. So longer term, Halifax, shorter and near term, much more tactical, which we'll be talking to you about."

And so I think what that's taught us is what we've been doing in the last 5 to 10 years is really avoiding out of market lending. So the opportunities other than acquisitions we're thinking about are in the Channel Islands. So the acquisition of ABN gave us about $500 million of sort of private banking and small managed company corporate loans, and that's kind of what is our appetite. And looking at the Channel Islands, AA-minus jurisdictions, predominantly financial services, not related -- not really sort of focused on tourism, great opportunity, I think, to make, particularly Guernsey and possibly Jersey, look a little bit more like Bermuda and Cayman to be full-service banks, sort of high-end residential mortgages potentially.  
So we're still working through that, but we think there's an opportunity to do in-market lending there as well. And actually broaden out the product set to look more like Bermuda and Cayman. So that's what I was referring to."

Obviously, we're collecting -- we're pleased to see the participation rate drops, obviously, for the second one.

I think Bermuda has been a bit slower to get back to work, generally, if you look at government statistics for unemployment, et cetera. So I think it's had the desired effect. It was nice to see the participation rate drop, and a number of people saying, ""Look, this is fine, I can stop paying again."" But I have no doubt that there will be a need for us to assist customers even after the 6 months, and there will be some that perhaps are going to miss going into the winter season. And Bermuda, in particular, missed their ability to service their loans, and we'll have to work with those customers on different solutions. I mean we still have the playbooks from the last financial crisis in terms of TDRs, et cetera. So I think we know what to do. It's still a little bit uncertain, but it's good to see the progress quarter-over-quarter."

Just overall, obviously, we had about $20 million or so roughly going to NAL. And it's a pretty simple story. It's -- half of it's basically one commercial facility that was really sort of more of a private banking-type structured loan. That has lots of collateral, but unfortunately, has various entities who are sort of going after that collateral. So it's overcollateralized, there's a situation that we need to work through, but we still think that there's plenty of collateral there. But that's the 1 commercial loan. The other half of the $20 million or so was a handful of residential mortgages.  
And just to start off, I would say we do expect residential mortgages in terms of 30-day delinquencies and 90-day NALs to increase. I mean, obviously, we're going into the winter season after not having a tourism season, particularly in Bermuda. So we think that weakness will definitely be in Bermuda, not so much Cayman and not the Channel Islands. So we do want to put that out there. But I would say, because we had this deferral program, which was really almost automatic for Q2, we typically have a -- usually have a high cure rate. So we have a good team that basically dials for dollars and calls people. It's a small community. We know people, and it's really trying to get -- convince them to pay us versus other creditors, potentially. And we usually do a good job. During Q2, during the lockdown, obviously, we weren't doing that. It would be inappropriate to be calling people at home when they can't even be working. 
So I think some of the mortgage on accruals, most of those facilities were already having trouble sort of 30-day delinquencies. And I think they used the period where no one else was paying to sort of say, ""Okay, I won't pay this, this month."" And that was during, basically, the lockdown. So we think that was partially driven by that. But I would say we have to look at the economy. Bermuda is shrinking, and we do think we're going to have some residential mortgage issues. But the great news in our book is we're 63% residential mortgages. So again, coming into the crisis, we don't have a lot of hospitality, tourism loans. The hotel loans are really well underwritten, only $7 million of restaurant loans. And the commercial loans are all office buildings supported by reinsurance company leases. So it's a good problem to have. I think it's a residential mortgage problem. It's granular, but that will tick up, we think."

On the resi side, really folks were already kind of 30 days past due. And you can see that in Note 6, if you look at the rating migration down the track there. We're obviously not expecting anything to come through next quarter just because of the deferral program. So ultimately, as Michael said, in Q4, will be kind of when we know the fuller picture.

And then -- I mean the only other comparison I really have is the sort of 2013, '14, where we had about 50 or 60 TDRs come through the pipe. And most of them are still performing, obviously, today. But yes, I mean, clarity wise, I think it's going to be a couple of quarters, and it will primarily depend on the speed at which people get back to work and how many people get back to work because that's going to ultimately determine whether -- their ability to pay effectively."

And so they're going to open right up into their winter season, which is their high season. Bermuda's timing is a little less fortunate. I mean we have daily Delta flights. We've got a BA flight coming in, but you get -- 60 to 100 people a day is not really tourism. So I think going into the winter, it's going to be -- the issues will be in Bermuda, certainly not in Cayman and not in the Channel Islands."

Quite impressive to see the magnitude of decline for deposit costs. Certainly, that benefited NIM this quarter. But as we look out, I guess, how should we be thinking about incremental pressure on asset yields? And it looks like at this point, much of that is going to flow through the margin.

So there's a bit more pressure coming through on the resi side next quarter, call it, a couple of handful of basis points on the resi side just from a full quarter impact. 
Obviously, the investment portfolio will depend on where prepayment speeds go at the moment. We don't have a lot of premium amortization in that book. But prepayment speeds are probably in the high teens coming into the second quarter, which is up quite materially. So we're getting a lot more maturities coming through with lower reinvestment rates, which is driving duration in. But if you think about that from an annualized basis, and you think about the $180 million positive mark-to-market, which is going to come through the asset yield on the investment side, that kind of blends back to 20, 30 basis points a year as long as interest rates are where they are today. So I think we've seen most of the effects on the loan asset yield come through this quarter. 
On the deposit side, for the first quarter, our interest-bearing demand deposits were actually yielding negative, partly because the balance is strong and partly because the euros were repriced down. So we had negative 12 basis points actually on that, which drove down the average cost of deposits. And then the rollovers are going to come through in a 3-, 6-month bucket. So there's a bit more a bit more benefit to come through in the short-term as well, while those rollovers reprice into lower rates. 
So I think overall, you could see 5 to 15 basis points in the near term, and then it should stabilize. And as we then start to ladder out, the ABN deposits into investment securities. Now that we have a year's worth of data, we should see some pickup on the overall NIM, about -- probably about 40 basis points, and we'll probably ladder that out $100 million a quarter for the next 6 quarters or so. That will help a little bit, again, offset some of the compression in the near term, and then it should kind of start to turn a little bit."

During the third quarter of 2020, we continued to strengthen our position as a leading offshore provider of banking and wealth management with franchise level market shares in our core operating jurisdictions. 
Our ability to support clients with world-class financial services helps us generate capital efficiencies, which complements our solid revenues from a conservatively managed balance sheet. As you will see on Slide 4, Butterfield has continued to report strong results with net income of $30.5 million and core net income of $36.5 million or $0.73 per share and a core return on tangible common equity of 16.2%. 
The core results in the third quarter exclude $6.7 million in staff exit costs resulting from the voluntary retirement and redundancy programs that are being implemented and resulting in the reduction of around 100 full-time roles across the organization. This corresponds to 7.4% of the workforce in light of the continued ultra-low interest rate environment and business challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have made a significant adjustment to the ongoing cost base to help offset the financial impact to the bank. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we are pleased to complete the full Cayman Islands banking integration, which was 1 quarter later than planned due to COVID. Overall, I'm delighted with the results of the acquisition and the transition of the business and people onto Butterfield's platform. 
This now positions Butterfield to grow with a more meaningful market share in the Cayman Islands. We also added 2 new nonexecutive directors and enhanced risk and compliance management with new executive level hires. In addition to the new directors, I would also like to acknowledge the onboarding of new group Executive Committee members; Sabet Sadik, Group Chief Risk Officer; Marie Hidalgo, Group Head of Compliance and operational Risk and Kevin Dallas, Group Head of Marketing and Communications. 
They are all strong additions to our executive management team and have already started making meaningful contribution towards the success of Butterfield. 
Turning now to Slide 5. In general, the island jurisdictions where our businesses are located have handled the health-related aspects of the pandemic well. Bermuda came into the Cayman Islands are experiencing relatively low infection levels and sporadic cases, which has allowed the local economies to open up and allow for fairly normal domestic commerce to resume. 
Visitor numbers for Bermudan Cayman are down this year with no cruise ship business and significantly lower airlift and stayover visitors on those flights than in prior years. For context, pre-pandemic tourism represented 17% and 25% of GDP for Bermudan Cayman, respectively. While difficult for tourism-related businesses, the islands are doing well and are seeing visitors numbers slowly return with stringent health-related arrival protocols, contact tracing and testing to control imported and local transmission of COVID cases. At this point, the testing and tracing has been effected at maintaining low rates of transition. 
On the top right of Slide 5, we have provided a summary of the deferral program we offer to mortgage clients in good standing, which covered a total of 6 months principal and interest deferrals. By the end of the second 3-month period in September, the participation rate was 34% of total qualifying borrowers. In order to better understand current customer needs and repayment capacity, we started an ongoing calling program in Bermuda, which has contacted around 500 borrowers or 20% of Bermuda mortgage holders. 
Of those borrowers, 92% have so far indicated that they plan to resume normal payments, while 6% have indicated that they may require potential further relief. Only 2% have stated that they do not anticipate being able to resume normal payments. 
As stated in the past, we will continue to work closely with customers to determine how best to help those who experience difficulty. We closely monitor all credit assets and the general credit environment and view these initial results as a positive indicator that the majority of clients should be in a position to resume payments and meet their obligations. 
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the third quarter."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. I will begin on Slide 7 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the third quarter, NIM of 2.30 was 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter, due to the lower sterling and dollar interest rates as well as the full quarter",740,"Thank you, Michael. I will begin on Slide 7 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the third quarter, NIM of 2.30 was 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter, due to the lower sterling and dollar interest rates as well as the full quarter interest expense on the new $100 million subordinated debt issued in June. 
The added expense mainly represents the timing difference between the issuance in June 2020 and the planned redemption of existing issues in the second half of this year. The lower double rate environment and buyout options for MBS assets have increased the prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio, which results in accelerated reinvestment in U.S. agency securities at lower rates. 
New money yields averaged 1.48% in the third quarter. Floating rate loans also trended lower with an average yield of 4.43%, down 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the third quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.78% for $143 million of new loans, up slightly from 3.54% for $152 million of originations in the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 8. Noninterest income was up 12.5% compared to the last quarter due to the recovery in domestic economic activity in the current quarter after the prior quarter's COVID impacts. Banking fees in the third quarter also benefited from a $1.5 million onetime loan structure change fee. The bank's contribution from fees continues to represent stable and capital-efficient earnings. For the third quarter, fees were 38.8% of total revenue. 
Slide 9 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which was up 3.3% in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. Expenses increased due to the return of more normalized activity levels in the third quarter. The bank's recent cost restructure program has resulted in $6.7 million of noncore staff exit costs this quarter. The lower staff complement will reduce future expense run rates with payback from exit costs expected within 1 year. 
We continue to target a through-cycle cost income ratio of 60%, but we do expect to remain in the mid-60s during this ulta-low part of the rate cycle. 
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. The bank remains very well capitalized with capital levels significantly in excess of Basel III regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 1.2% in the third quarter and is up 10.8% over the past 12 months. We continue to view growth of tangible book value per share as a very important factor in creating long-term value for shareholders. 
In addition to the regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, we have continued to repurchase shares during this quarter. As at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 200,000 shares remaining in our 3.5 million share repurchase authorization from December 2019. We continue to view share buybacks as an important component of our capital management strategy, and we'll provide further updates on future authorizations once the 2021 operating plans have been finalized. 
Turning now to Slide 11. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a very liquid profile. At the end of the third quarter, the loan portfolio represented only 37.4% of total assets and liquid assets were 59.6% of total assets. The bank's balance sheet has now stabilized following a few quarters of declines due to the planned deposit pricing alignment following the acquisition of ABN AMRO Cayman Islands in July 2019. 
The the bank has maintained a low-risk density with risk-weighted assets to total assets of 36.7%, down slightly from 37.1% last quarter. On Slide 12, you can see that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in its investment portfolio. That is 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. 
Nonaccrual loans were relatively stable in the third quarter at $74.8 million or 1.5% of gross loans. On Slide 13, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 4.2 years from 3.6 years last quarter. Due to a planned deployment of excess dollar deposits from the Cayman Islands acquisition and a repositioning of $350 million of floating rate Guernsey securities to fixed rate agency securities. 
Similar to last quarter, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in both up and down rate scenarios. I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

We remain optimistic about the financial health and earnings prospects for Butterfield. We are encouraged by the favorable indications that are coming through the retail mortgage book calling program. We expect to have more detail and clarity in the fourth quarter, however, initial indications suggest that the bank's conservative underwriting, payment deferral programs continued work with borrowers and a well-seasoned low LTV profile should help us manage through this period of potential credit stress. 
As we have discussed in the past, expense management is an aspect of our earnings that we have some control over. This quarter, we have taken decisive actions to lower the expense base of the organization. We carefully evaluated operational, cyber, credit and compliance risk profiles across the platforms and implemented a 3-stage program, starting with simplification of business units and senior executive retirements followed by voluntary exit programs in Bermudan Cayman; and finally, a redundancy program across the organization. 
This was obviously difficult for the whole organization and particularly for those affected and their teams. But I am confident the program enacted during this quarter will help rightsize the expense base to reflect the current business environment with continued low interest rates and some credit uncertainty. 
Finally, capital management remains a key focus for us, with emphasis on the sustainable dividend, share buybacks, organic growth and retaining capacity for potential M&A. It remains our goal that Butterfield continues to deliver top quartile returns and grow long-term value across the credit and rate cycle.

So total, about 100 positions corresponds to about 7.5% of our total workforce. I would caution that we are very focused on backfilling areas where we might have increased operational risk in Halifax and Bermudan Cayman. So some of those 100 positions will have to refill a bit. So I would say, and we've talked about this in the past. Bermudan Cayman, the total cost all in of an FT is about $100,000 per head. But I would say the annual normalized run rate from these programs would be about $7 million to $8 million a year after backfill."

The laddering out of securities and sort of appreciate that you're set up pretty well from an NII standpoint, no matter what happens with rate changes. But just given the current outlook for rates and kind of big in this environment for a while, do you think that you have enough levers to reverse NII kind of pushing margin aside? Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts there. But if you look at NII, it's been declining in the last couple of quarters. Obviously, a lot of pressures. But based on some of the things you're talking about laddering out the securities book, et cetera, do you feel like we've kind of reached a bottom on NII? Or is there still some room for that to move lower?"

So I think the loan yields, in particular, as I mentioned on the -- in the prepared remarks as well, our loan yields currently are below the book yields for the existing loans. Most of that is because of the places that we originate. So we've had relatively more mortgage origination in Cayman at lower rates and in Sterling, which is good from an NII perspective. But obviously, it does put pressure on the loan yields. I think the investments, clearly, we saw a seasonal peak in CPRs in July and August. We expect that to kind of moderate somewhat going into the winter. So that should slow down to prepayment speeds on the investment side. So with the laddering. So about 60% of the NIM impact in the investment yield for this quarter was actually due to the accelerated prepayment speeds and about 40% was due to rate volume. So some of that will depend a little bit on where the prepayment speeds actually slowed down in particular buyout options. Deposits rolled into, obviously, on a fixed-term deposits rolled into lower rates at we would expected, but it was -- that NIM impact was offset slightly by demand by the euro demand deposits rolling off in ABN and also growth in retail deposits. Both Bermuda and Cayman have had some optional redemptions from pensions during this period as part of the fiscal stimulus package. And that's resulted obviously in an inflow of deposits to the bank, but mostly in contractually noninterest-bearing deposits. 
And then finally, you had the sub debt, which contributed about 3 basis points, but that was mainly a timing difference over the next couple of quarters. So I think on the cost side, we should see the deposit costs come down over the next couple of quarters, so that should help. And then with the laddering out, you're sort of fighting that reinvestment picture a little bit on the investment book. So I think it will stabilize over the near term. And then longer term, it will depend on the 10-year rate, as we've said before. I think with the 10-year being below 1% a little bit of life of late in that. So our new money is out at 148 in this quarter. So it will depend a little bit on the longer durations in the yield curve. But I think the short end will has kind of bottomed out, if that makes sense."

So they actually believe that they have enough in their checking accounts to make it through to Q3 of next year. And then we would expect a gradual draw on that facility. Jersey and Guernsey, again, they've had very little need to draw on those facilities, but we are getting a little bit of commitment fees with those facilities. And so I would say flattish overall."

I would only say that we've been through these cycles in the past. The most sensitive industry is obviously the reinsurance industry. But they've gone through some real changes that have reduced the tax advantage of being offshore in Bermuda. And not most of them really didn't change our strategies at all, so they didn't move back to the U.S. They didn't move to Dublin, they stayed in Bermuda. And I think that's because there's -- it's a broader market. So the tax advantages are really important, but they're also close to all the wholesale reinsurance and the accountants and brokers and bankers that actually understand the industry. So it's a real market that has legs that isn't completely driven by tax. 
I think there's going to be changes to offshore earnings for U.S. companies again, and that could have some impact. But the very large technology companies, we don't bank anyway. They may have incorporations offshore, but it's not like we have a lot of deposits from them, really. So that flow of money may impact us marginally, but I don't think it's really not a big part of our business. So it's something to watch, and it will continue to change, but I don't see it having a huge impact."

So the high ROE would support a a larger deployment into buybacks. The program that we had in place, as you recall, was at December 2019 program. So it came out of the planning session at that point. It was $3.5 million authorization, which is pretty close to exhausted, and we would expect to, obviously, look at capital again as we finalize our plans for next year.

Following their prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter results. The press release, along with a slide presentation that we will refer to during our remarks on this call, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.butterfieldgroup.com.
Before I turn the call over to Michael Collins, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For a reconciliation of these measures to U.S. GAAP, please refer to the earnings press release and slide presentation. Today's call on associated materials may also contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.
On Slide 25 of the presentation, we have also included a list of potential factors relevant to the implications of COVID-19 for the bank. Additional information regarding these risks can be found in our SEC filings.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Collins."

During the third quarter of 2020, we continued to strengthen our position as a leading offshore provider of banking and wealth management with franchise-level market shares in our core operating jurisdictions.
Our ability to support clients with world-class financial services helps us generate capital efficiencies, which complements our solid revenues from a conservatively managed balance sheet. As you will see on Slide 4, Butterfield has continued to report strong results with net income of $30.5 million and core net income of $36.5 million or $0.73 per share and a core return on tangible common equity of 16.2%. 
The core results in the third quarter exclude $6.7 million in staff exit costs resulting from the voluntary retirement and redundancy programs that are being implemented and resulting in the reduction of around 100 full-time roles across the organization. This corresponds to 7.4% of the workforce. In light of the continued ultra-low interest rate environment and business challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, we have made a significant adjustment to the ongoing cost base to help offset the financial impact to the bank.
During the third quarter of 2020, we are pleased to complete the full Channel Islands banking integration, which was 1 quarter later than planned due to COVID. Overall, I'm delighted with the results of the acquisition and the transition of the business and people onto Butterfield's platform. This now positions Butterfield to grow with a more meaningful market share in the Channel Islands.
We also added 2 new nonexecutive directors and enhanced risk and compliance management with new executive-level hires. In addition to the new directors, I would also like to acknowledge the onboarding of new group executive committee members: Sabeth Siddique, Group Chief Risk Officer; Bri Hidalgo, Group Head of Compliance and Operational Risk; and Kevin Dallas, Group Head of Marketing and Communications. They are all strong additions to our executive management team and have already started making meaningful contribution towards the success of Butterfield.
Turning now to Slide 5. In general, the island jurisdictions, where our businesses are located, have handled the health-related aspects of the pandemic well. Bermuda, Cayman and Channel Islands are experiencing relatively low infection levels and sporadic cases, which has allowed the local economies to open up and allowed for fairly normal domestic commerce to resume. Visitor numbers for Bermuda and Cayman are down this year with no cruise ship business and significantly lower airlift and stay-over visitors on those flights than in prior years.
For context, pre-pandemic, tourism represented 17% and 25% of GDP for Bermuda and Cayman, respectively. While difficult for tourism-related businesses, the islands are doing well and are seeing visitors numbers slowly return with stringent health-related arrival protocols, contact tracing and testing to control imported and local transmission of COVID cases. At this point, the testing and tracing have been effective at maintaining low rates of transition.
On the top right of Slide 5, we have provided a summary of the deferral program we offered to mortgage clients in good standing, which covered a total of 6 months principal and interest deferrals. By the end of the second 3-month period in September, the participation rate was 34% of total qualifying borrowers. In order to better understand current customer needs and repayment capacity, we started an ongoing calling program in Bermuda, which has contacted around 500 borrowers or 20% of Bermuda mortgage holders. Of those borrowers, 92% have so far indicated that they plan to resume normal payments, while 6% have indicated that they may require potential further relief. Only 2% have stated that they do not anticipate being able to resume normal payments.
As stated in the past, we will continue to work closely with customers to determine how best to help those who experience difficulty. We closely monitor all credit assets and the general credit environment and view these initial results as a positive indicator that the majority of clients should be in a position to resume payments and meet their obligations.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the third quarter."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. I will begin on Slide 7 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the third quarter, NIM of 2.30% was 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to the lower sterling and dollar interest rates as well as the full quarter",737,"Thank you, Michael. I will begin on Slide 7 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the third quarter, NIM of 2.30% was 18 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to the lower sterling and dollar interest rates as well as the full quarter interest expense on the new $100 million subordinated debt issued in June. The added expense mainly represents the timing difference between the issuance in June 2020 and the planned redemption of existing issues in the second half of this year.
The lower dollar rate environment and buyout options for MBS assets have increased the prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio, which results in an accelerated reinvestment in U.S. agency securities at lower rates.
New money yields averaged 1.48% in the third quarter. Floating rate loans also trended lower with an average yield of 4.43%, down 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the third quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.78% for $143 million of new loans, up slightly from 3.54% for $152 million of originations in the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 8. Noninterest income was up 12.5% compared to the last quarter due to the recovery in domestic economic activity in the current quarter after the prior quarter's COVID impacts. Banking fees in the third quarter also benefited from a $1.5 million onetime loan structure change fee. The bank's contribution from fees continues to represent stable and capital-efficient earnings. For the third quarter, fees were 38.8% of total revenue.
Slide 9 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which was up 3.3% in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. Expenses increased due to the return of more normalized activity levels in the third quarter. The bank's recent cost restructure program has resulted in $6.7 million of noncore staff exit costs this quarter. The lower staff complement will reduce future expense run rates with payback from exit costs expected within 1 year.
We continue to target a through-cycle cost/income ratio of 60%, but we do expect to remain in the mid-60s during this ultra-low part of the rate cycle.
Slide 10 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. The bank remains very well capitalized with capital levels significantly in excess of Basel III regulatory requirements. Tangible book value per share increased 1.2% in the third quarter and is up 10.8% over the past 12 months. We continue to view growth of tangible book value per share as a very important factor in creating long-term value for shareholders.
In addition to the regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, we have continued to repurchase shares during this quarter. As at the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 200,000 shares remaining in our 3.5 million share repurchase authorization from December 2019. We continue to view share buybacks as an important component of our capital management strategy, and we'll provide further updates on future authorizations once the 2021 operating plans have been finalized.
Turning now to Slide 11. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a very liquid profile. At the end of the third quarter, the loan portfolio represented only 37.4% of total assets and liquid assets were 59.6% of total assets. The bank's balance sheet has now stabilized following a few quarters of declines due to the planned deposit pricing alignment following the acquisition of ABN AMRO Channel Islands in July 2019. The bank has maintained a low-risk density with risk-weighted assets to total assets of 36.7%, down slightly from 37.1% last quarter. 
On Slide 12, you can see that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in its investment portfolio, that is, 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans were relatively stable in the third quarter at $74.8 million or 1.5% of gross loans.
On Slide 13, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 4.2 years from 3.6 years last quarter. Due to a planned deployment of excess dollar deposits from the Channel Islands acquisition and a repositioning of $350 million of floating-rate Ginnie securities to fixed-rate agency securities. Similar to last quarter, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in both up and down rate scenarios.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

We remain optimistic about the financial health and earnings prospects for Butterfield. We are encouraged by the favorable indications that are coming through the retail mortgage book calling program. We expect to have more detail and clarity in the fourth quarter. However, initial indications suggest that the bank's conservative underwriting, payment deferral programs, continued work with borrowers and a well-seasoned low LTV profile should help us manage through this period of potential credit stress.
As we have discussed in the past, expense management is an aspect of our earnings that we have some control over. This quarter, we have taken decisive actions to lower the expense base of the organization. We carefully evaluated the operational, cyber, credit and compliance risk profiles across the platforms and implemented a 3-stage program, starting with simplification of business units and senior executive retirements, followed by voluntary exit programs in Bermuda and Cayman, and finally, a redundancy program across the organization. This was, obviously, difficult for the whole organization and particularly for those affected and their teams. But I am confident the program enacted during this quarter will help rightsize the expense base to reflect the current business environment with continued low interest rates and some credit uncertainty.
Finally, capital management remains a key focus for us, with emphasis on the sustainable dividend, share buybacks, organic growth and retaining capacity for potential M&A. It remains our goal that Butterfield continues to deliver top quartile returns and grow long-term value across the credit and rate cycle.
Thank you. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So total, about 100 positions corresponds to about 7.5% of our total workforce. I would caution that we are very focused on backfilling areas where we might have increased operational risk in Halifax and Bermuda and Cayman. So some of those 100 positions will have to refill a bit. So I would say -- and we've talked about this in the past. Bermuda and Cayman, the total cost all-in of an FTE is about $100,000 per head. But I would say, the annual normalized run rate from these programs would be about $7 million to $8 million a year after backfill."

So there was about $350 million of net new, if you will, from the existing AFS portfolio. So that should help the NIM a little bit going forward.
On the ABN side, we would expect to ladder out about $150 million per quarter for the next 4 to 6 quarters, and then we'll review again the stickiness of deposits once we get through that next year."

I would say that it's still a strange time. I mean, I think, talking to various parties, there clearly going to be opportunities, and there's going to be a point in time where, I think, more transactions will happen. But looking at the banking side, it obviously is very difficult to value credit assets. I mean we're looking at our own credit, and we think we're in a reasonable shape. But it's not like normal days. So I think banking acquisition would be more difficult than a trust acquisition today, but we are continuing to have discretions across the board."

So I think the loan yields, in particular, as I mentioned on the -- in the prepared remarks as well, our loan yields currently are below the book yields for the existing loans. Most of that is because of the places that we originate. So we've had relatively more mortgage origination in Cayman at lower rates and in sterling, which is good from an NII perspective. But obviously, it does put pressure on the loan yields. I think the investments, clearly -- we saw a seasonal peak in CPRs in July and August. We expect that to kind of moderate somewhat going into the winter. So that should slow down the prepayment speeds on the investment side with the laddering. So about 60% of the NIM impact in the investment yield for this quarter was actually due to the accelerated prepayment speeds and about 40% was due to rate and volume.
So some of that will depend a little bit on where the prepayment speeds actually slowed down, in particular, buyout options. Deposits rolled into -- obviously, fixed-term deposits rolled into lower rates, which we expected, but it was -- that NIM impact was offset slightly by demand -- by the euro demand deposits rolling off in ABN and also growth in retail deposits. Both Bermuda and Cayman have had some optional redemptions from pensions during this period as part of the fiscal stimulus package, and that's resulted, obviously, in an inflow of deposits to the bank, but mostly in contractually noninterest-bearing deposits.
And then finally, you had the sub-debt, which contributed about 3 basis points, but that was mainly a timing difference over the next couple of quarters. So I think on the cost side, we should see the deposit costs come down over the next couple of quarters. So that should help. And then with the laddering out, you're sort of fighting that reinvestment picture a little bit on the investment book. So I think it will stabilize over the near term. And then longer term, it will depend on the 10-year rate, as we've said before. I think with the 10-year being below 1%, we've seen a little bit of life of late in that. So our new money is out at [ 1.48% ] in this quarter. So it will depend a little bit on the longer durations in the yield curve. But I think the short end will -- has kind of bottomed out, if that makes sense."

But they've gone through some real changes that have reduced the tax advantage of being offshore in Bermuda. And most of them really didn't change their strategies at all. So they didn't move back to the U.S. They didn't move to Dublin. They stayed in Bermuda. And I think that's because there's -- it's a broader market. So the tax advantages are really important, but they're also close to all the wholesale reinsurance and the accountants and brokers and bankers that actually understand the industry. So it's a real market that has legs that isn't completely driven by tax.
I think there's going to be changes to offshore earnings for U.S. companies again, and that could have some impact. But the very large technology companies, we don't bank anyway. They may have incorporations offshore, but it's not like we have a lot of ready deposits from them really. So that flow of money may impact us marginally, but I don't think it's -- it's really not a big part of our business. So it's something to watch, and it will continue to change, but I don't see it having a huge impact."

In terms of the excess -- in the absence of any accretive M&A deals that are more concrete, we would, obviously, look at our forward planning model and then say, we don't need any more capital really for -- maybe modest capital for credit migration, but not really a material amount of additional capital from retained earnings.
So the high ROE would support a larger deployment into buybacks. The program that we had in place, as you recall, was a December 2019 program. So it came out of the planning session at that point. It was $3.5 million authorization, which is pretty close to exhausted, and we would expect to, obviously, look at capital again as we finalize our plans for next year.

So is the clarification there that the only reason they haven't made the payment here is because the payment at that time hadn't come due yet and -- but you expected them to?
