Today, I will discuss our 2019 performance and our strategy to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. I'll begin with some of the key highlights for this cal",1906,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2019 performance and our strategy to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. I'll begin with some of the key highlights for this call on Slide 3. 
In 2019, we earned $1.36 of adjusted EPS, 10% higher than in 2018 and toward the top end of our range of $1.30 to $1.38. We are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022. In 2019, after reducing our parent debt by half, we were upgraded to an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. In 2019, we completed construction of 2.2 gigawatts of new projects. We also signed 2.8 gigawatts of renewable contracts, bringing our backlog to 6.1 gigawatts. This pace puts us on track to nearly triple our portfolio of renewables in operation to 22 gigawatts by the end of 2024 versus 2016. 
We achieved critical milestones in expanding our LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Vietnam. To accelerate a broader adoption of clean energy, we are delivering innovative energy solutions through our leading platforms, including Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. Considering our success to date in substantially lowering our carbon intensity, today, I'm announcing a target to reduce our coal-fired generation to below 30% measured in megawatt hours by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce it to less than 10% by 2030. 
Turning now to our strategy on Slide 4. We spent the last several years positioning AES to lead the energy transition and cementing our place as a top renewables developer throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, I will discuss the 3 core themes of our strategy: investing in sustainable growth, offering innovative solutions and delivering superior results. 
Through our strong presence in key markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the global transition towards more sustainable energy. In these markets, we see growth in clean energy of 30 gigawatts per year. By capitalizing on our competitive position and the dynamics favoring clean power generation, we have had great success in increasing our backlog of signed PPAs. 
Turning now to that backlog of projects, beginning on Slide 5. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 gigawatts, of which approximately half is wind, 40% is solar, and 10% is energy storage. 40% of this capacity is in the U.S., and 60% is located internationally. 
Turning to Slide 6, beginning with the U.S. Our sPower and AES distributed energy businesses maintained their momentum by adding more than 1 gigawatt of new long-term contracted renewable projects to our backlog. The rate of growth from our distributed energy business is particularly impressive. In 2019, it signed 365 megawatts under long-term PPAs, 3x more than in 2018. One of the reasons for this business' success is its deep knowledge of customers in specific markets, including Hawaii and the Northeastern U.S. For example, in Hawaii, we delivered the world's largest solar-plus-storage project. And during the year, we were awarded an additional 205 megawatts of similar projects. 
As a reminder, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, such as our presence in growth markets and our 25 gigawatts of development pipeline, including land and interconnection rights; our ability to bring low-cost capital to optimize AES' return on equity and our relationship with key customers, including those for whom we are implementing our Green Blend and Extend product. 
Now to Slide 7. As of the end of last year, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs was 6.1 gigawatts, half of which was under construction. Approximately 80% of the total or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split among hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. 
In terms of the 3 gigawatts that was under construction, I am pleased to announce that the 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering project achieved commercial operations on February 6. This project was completed ahead of time and slightly under budget and is helping to support the reliability of the grid in Southern California. The remaining 1.7 gigawatts under construction are renewables and energy storage. The majority of these projects are expected to come online in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. 
In addition to our 6.1-gigawatt backlog and the 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual renewable PPAs that we expect to sign, we see opportunities for attractive investments that are not currently included in our forecast, such as further rate-based growth at DPL and IPL as well as more renewables and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 9. Another example of how we are achieving sustainable growth is AES Gener, which is one of our most important businesses. AES Gener is transforming its portfolio by growing its wind and solar businesses and strengthening its balance sheet. Under its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener is negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of its thermal contract and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. 
In 2018, AES Gener announced its Green Blend and Extend strategy. And today, I'm pleased to report that since then, it has executed 2.5 gigawatts of long-term renewable contracts, the majority of which were signed in the last 12 months. As a result, AES Gener has significantly diversified its generation mix and has positioned itself to deliver attractive long-term growth. Specifically, these new contracts will more than double its renewable capacity and largely offset the roll-off of legacy contracts in Chile through 2024. 
In Colombia, AES Gener is successfully expanding from a single hydro asset to a broader portfolio, which will include wind and solar. AES Gener will primarily serve its Green Blend and Extend contracts through a combination of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and its existing portfolio. We expect these new projects to deliver mid-teen returns to AES. In addition to this new capacity, the Alto Maipo hydroelectric complex will be substantially completed by the end of this year and will help supply these new PPAs. Gustavo will discuss how AES Gener will fund the 1.6 gigawatts of new investments, including AES participation. 
Now to Slide 10 and the second theme of our strategy. In addition to growing our core infrastructure business, we're also developing new solutions to meet increasing customer demand for 24/7 renewable power and greater energy efficiency. Our focus is on solutions that are scalable and relatively capital-light, which allow us to work with our customers to co-create applications that meet their most critical energy needs. 
A key platform for us in this area is our energy storage business, Fluence, which continues to be the global market leader. Through this partnership with Siemens, we are well positioned to benefit from the expected 15 to 20 gigawatts of annual growth in energy storage globally. Today, we're already seeing that nearly half of our solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. 
In 2019, Fluence won contracts for 961 megawatts and has tripled its backlog since 2018 to a record of 1.2 gigawatts, which equates to roughly $1 billion in revenue. Fluence is cash- and margin-positive and is continuing to expand its capabilities, including modular, prefab and solar DC-coupled products to address new market opportunities. 
Across all of our platforms, we've also been incorporating innovative applications. An example is a 10-megawatt 5-hour-duration energy storage facility at AES Gener's Alfaro hydro plant in Chile. This groundbreaking project will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world, providing the run-of-the-river plant with capabilities similar to a traditional reservoir. AES Gener expects to inaugurate this project in March, and it has the potential to increase this virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts. Turning to Slide 11. Last quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business lines. We're actively working together to develop new solutions to accelerate a broader adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. This alliance also encompasses energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. 
Now to Slide 12. Our strategic investment in Uplight continues to grow rapidly. As a reminder, Uplight provides utilities with a suite of digital services, including an online marketplace. These solutions improve end customer experiences while helping utilities balance energy demand and reduce service costs. This business now works with over 80 electric and gas utilities and reaches over 100 million households and businesses in the United States. Uplight has over $100 million in sales in 2019 with solid margin and continues to fund growth without additional equities. We see Uplight as very well positioned to benefit enormously from continued growth in cloud-based digital solutions in all aspects of energy management. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13 and the third theme of our strategy, superior results. As we invest in sustainable growth and offer innovative solutions to our customers, we are transforming our portfolio while achieving superior financial results. In late 2019, we received our first investment-grade rating and expect that we will receive another investment-grade rating this year. Additionally, through 2022, our portfolio is expected to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders. This return includes our dividend, which has grown by 30% over the last 5 years, and we expect it will continue to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
Having the right energy mix is key to our future success. This morning, we announced a target to reduce our generation from coal to below 30% of our total volume by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce generation from coal to less than 10% of our total by 2030. We are also committed to providing timely and accurate ESG data. We were the first U.S. investor-owned company in our sector to publish a climate scenario report, consistent with the recommendations of a task force on climate-related financial disclosures. Additionally, we currently provide a substantial portion of the disclosures recommended by SASB and expect to provide virtually all of the remaining data by the end of this year. 
We're beginning to see the benefit of attracting a wider investor base that appreciates AES' growth in clean energy and innovation while maintaining consistent financial performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Gustavo, let me address the issue of COVID-19 or the coronavirus. As a long-term contracted generator, overwhelmingly in U.S. dollars and the U.S. utility business, we see limited impact from most likely scenarios from the coronavirus epidemic. Furthermore, as I have previously laid out, AES has a strong pipeline of contracted, mostly renewable projects, that ensure our growth over the coming years. Although we may suffer some delivery delays, both our solar and energy storage businesses have largely secured their supplies of lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic sales for this year. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to ensure the resiliency of our business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achievin",1659,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achieving the upper end range of our adjusted EPS and setting a solid foundation for growth. As shown on Slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.36 primarily reflecting growth at our regulated utilities, contribution from new businesses, including renewables in AES Colón, and a lower tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the asset dispositions, including 2.6 gigawatt of coal-fired generation. 
Turning to Slide 16. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $55 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 17. 
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, this PTC reflects regulated rate cases completed in 2018 as well as contributions from new renewables projects. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of coal-fired generation at SharePoint and DPL. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and asset sales, partially offset by better operating results at Guacolda and lower interest expense in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the commencement of operations at AES Colón and better contracted prices in Panama as well as insurance recovery in the Dominican Republic and Panama net of outage costs. Importantly, these facilities in the DR and Panama have resumed operations at full capacity. 
I would now like to discuss briefly the resilience of our portfolio. This was the worst hydrological year on record in Panama, but the financial impact was significantly lower than in years past due to actions we have taken to improve our portfolio. The addition of AES Colón not only diversifies our fuel mix but also lowers the hydrologic exposure and spot price volatility of the entire system. This is just one example of how our capital allocation strategy has enabled us to lower our overall EPS risk from hydrology, foreign currency and commodities by 70% since 2011. 
Turning back to PTC in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect asset sales in the United Kingdom, Philippines and Netherlands. 
Now to Slide 21. Before moving on, I wanted to provide a couple of business updates, starting with DPL in Ohio. As you may know in November, the distribution modernization rider in DPL's electric security plan was removed, and we reverted back to ESP 1. The net impact of this decision reduced PTC by about $50 million annually. Roughly $25 million of this relates to costs that would have been recovered through a distribution investment rider. We expect it to start collecting this again in 2022 after new distribution rates have been filed and approved. 
In addition, as part of the order to revert to ESP 1, DPL needs to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test seat in April. This test customer for regulated utilities in Ohio and use it to assess regulated returns. We feel good about our ability to pass the test and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
Although the overall tariff reduction last year was disappointing, AES continues to be fully committed to DPL, and we look forward to resuming our discussions around smart grid and other modernization investment opportunities. DPL has the lowest residential tariff in Ohio, and we believe there continue to be significant opportunities to improve value to our customers. We expect to have more details about DPL's investment plan in the following quarters. 
Regarding Argentina, yesterday, the new administration announced anticipated reforms. As part of that, all-in prices have been reduced by about 15% to 20%, and the regulated tariffs have been linked to Argentina peso with local inflation adjustments. This is in line with our expectations following last year's election, and it is fully reflected in our guidance and expectations for 2022 and beyond. 
Importantly, we have also had some positive developments that work to offset the regulatory changes in Ohio and Argentina, highlighting once again the resilience of our portfolio. This includes the potential extension of our existing legacy generation at Southland, early efficiency gains from our cost savings and digital initiatives and opportunistic refinancings, leveraging a historical low interest rate environment. Regarding Southland, approval is still pending by the state water board and local permitting authorities and is expected for the second half of this year. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 22. Since 2011, we have reduced our current debt by $3.1 billion or 50%. At year-end, our current leverage was 3.7x, and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. After having attained our first investment-grade rating in November, we continue to expect a second upgrade this year. 
Turning to our 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 23, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash. This is largely consistent with our previous call, with the exception of the announced Jordan sale, which we now expected to close in the first half of this year. 
Now to use on the right-hand side. Roughly 60% of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt reduction and the remaining amount we invested in our subsidiaries primarily in our renewables backlog. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 24. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Growth this year will be driven by the completion of our 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering, which came online earlier this month and a full year of operations at OPGC 2 in India. Continued growth in renewals, including 1.5 gigawatt is scheduled to reach commercial operations this year, efficiency gains from cost cutting and our digital initiatives and a lower interest expense due to refinancing benefits and completed debt reduction. This growth will be partially offset by the reversion to ESP 1 at DPL Ohio, reduced tariffs in Argentina and a slightly higher tax rate. I will note that much of our growth will begin contributing later in the year, and our EPS is expected to be more weighted towards the second half. For instance, although Southland came online this month, it will be operating on a merchant basis until the PPA begins in June. 
Turning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $725 million to $775 million this year and is expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022 off a 2018 base. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, including roughly $750 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $550 million in asset sale proceeds. 
Moving to the users in the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the $180 million of temporary drawing on our revolver. Our credit metrics are very strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $750 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the Green Blend and Extend strategy at AES Gener. As Andrés mentioned, AES Gener has been successfully executing its decarbonization strategy by securing 2.5 gigawatt of renewable energy contracts. This includes growth in Colombia, where AES Gener is diversifying away from a single hydro asset to include new wind and solar resources. This replicates what AES has done in other markets such as Panama, where the addition of AES Colón diversified our portfolio and materially enhanced the value of our existing assets. 
As a result of its successful strategy execution, today, AES Gener announced a $500 million equity issuance to help fund it's $1.8 billion renewable growth program. And AES will be participating with our pro rata share of approximately $335 million. We believe this investment will create significant value to our shareholders and will allow AES Gener to remain an important contributor for AES' earnings and cash flow for years to come. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. This reflects an increase in targeted asset sales of roughly $400 million since our last call, which is fully incorporated in our guidance for the year and in the 7% to 9% growth rate. Given the range of opportunities we have, we feel confident in achieving this additional sales target in the next few years. 
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 28. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.6 billion to invest in our backlog, new project PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investments in AES Gener acquisitions. Once completed, this project should contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $400 million of unallocated cash is largely weighted towards 2022 and will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
Based on the significant transformation we have achieved at AES in the last several years, we now have a much stronger balance sheet and portfolio of assets. As such, we are well positioned to capitalize on our leadership in the global energy transition while delivering very solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

How do you think about your disclosed CapEx at this $8 billion mark relative to achieving your longer-term targets? And again, this is more of, as you ramp up, how do you think about where you are within that range?

So in the case of AES Gener, the capital raise is to fund the very successful Green Blend and Extend. We've gotten 2.5 gigawatts of Green, Blend and Extend PPAS. This is good for the existing assets. This is good for us because we get these long-term contracted renewables. Average life is around 17 years. 
So that is what we're raising the capital for. That's because that's up and above. We did very well in doing that, and Gener needs to raise the money. And it basically will largely offset the the roll-off of existing thermal contracts that Gener has through 2024. So that's one thing. So basically, the capital raise at Gener and our participation, we think it's a good investment. These are renewable contracts in dollars, inflation-adjusted. And we want to fund that growth and really move in into a sustainable long-term future. 
Regarding our other investments -- now this basically keeps us on the targets that we have given before. So we're on target. We are successfully delivering on these renewables. And what we're seeing is our investments in some of the most -- or innovative fields, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Uplight, are going to help us achieve those renewable goals and also achieve our financial targets. 
So it's all coming together very nicely. And what this really is allowing us to do is to beat our financial guidance and commitments while at the same time decarbonizing even faster. So that really is, I'd say, a big story. 
I think Gustavo will add something."

But what is very interesting also is this first virtual reservoir, which we have 10 megawatts up and running. And the regulation is in place. It's [indiscernible] batteries, and that it will allow us to dispatch this run-of-the-river plant differently, take advantage of differences in daily pricing. And if this goes well, we could expand this from 10 megawatts to 240, which would be really substantial.

Anybody you will talk to will talk about, whether it's the U.S., whether it's India, tens of gigawatts of energy storage, which is needed to be able to operate the greater numbers of renewables. And the technology keeps improving. We're coming out with new products. We'll be launching them this year, which will help lower costs. And for example, prefab, modular, et cetera. So that's very exciting. 
Now getting to valuation. As I've said in the past, we would like and to really get a marker by having our capital raise at Fluence, so that you can see what was the value created. So as you know, we feel that there's a lot of values being created. We think it would be a unique asset in the market. There's nothing else similar to it. So we're working on that. 
Regarding Upflight, we first bought Simple Energy and then we merged it with Uplight. And the valuation that we got from simple energy in that merger was up about 100% from what we paid in less than 2 years. So Uplight is again doing many things for a lot of people in terms of being really a cloud-based digital services provider for utilities, really the leader in the field. And it's also helping us with our cost savings and quality improvement as well. So that one will probably be longer term. I mean we're already seeing the benefits in terms of our own operations in terms of the things that we can offer. 
And you're right, especially in the case of Google, there's not that much that we can disclose other than this involves, as I said, energy management, providing them with energy. We have our first PPA in Chile to provide them with renewable power. And what's very interesting to them is really our ability to provide 24/7 renewable. So we're working on a number of fields with them. And in all of these is how we really get a competitive edge in renewables, that -- combining that with our existing platforms and existing client relationships."

Today, I will discuss our 2019 performance and our strategy to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. I'll begin with some of the key highlights for this call on Slide 3. 
In 2019, we earned $1.36 of adjusted EPS, 10% higher than in 2018 and toward the top end of our range of $1.30 to $1.38. We are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022. In 2019, after reducing our parent debt by half, we were upgraded to an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. In 2019, we completed construction of 2.2 gigawatts of new projects. We also signed 2.8 gigawatts of renewable contracts, bringing our backlog to 6.1 gigawatts. This pace puts us on track to nearly triple our portfolio of renewables in operation to 22 gigawatts by the end of 2024 versus 2016. 
We achieved critical milestones in expanding our LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Vietnam. To accelerate a broader adoption of clean energy, we are delivering innovative energy solutions through our leading platforms, including Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. 
Considering our success to date in substantially lowering our carbon intensity, today, I'm announcing a target to reduce our coal-fired generation to below 30%, measured in megawatt hours by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce it to less than 10% by 2030. 
Turning now to our strategy on Slide 4. We spent the last several years positioning AES to lead the energy transition and cementing our place as a top renewables developer throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, I will discuss the 3 core themes of our strategy: investing in sustainable growth, offering innovative solutions and delivering superior results. 
Through our strong presence in key markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the global transition towards more sustainable energy. In these markets, we see growth in clean energy of 30 gigawatts per year. By capitalizing on our competitive position and the dynamics favoring clean power generation, we have had great success in increasing our backlog of signed PPAs. 
Turning now to that backlog of projects, beginning on Slide 5. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 gigawatts, of which approximately half is wind, 40% is solar and 10% is energy storage. 40% of this capacity is in the U.S. and 60% is located internationally. 
Turning to Slide 6, beginning with the U.S. Our sPower and AES Distributed Energy businesses maintained their momentum by adding more than 1 gigawatt of new long-term contracted renewable projects to our backlog. The rate of growth from our distributed energy business is particularly impressive. In 2019, it signed 365 megawatts under long-term PPAs, 3x more than in 2018. One of the reasons for this business' success is its deep knowledge of customers in specific markets, including Hawaii and the Northeastern U.S. For example, in Hawaii, we delivered the world's largest solar-plus-storage project. And during the year, we were awarded an additional 205 megawatts of similar projects. 
As a reminder, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, such as our presence in growth markets and our 25 gigawatts of development pipeline, including land and interconnection rights; our ability to bring low-cost capital to optimize AES' return on equity; and our relationship with key customers, including those for whom we are implementing our Green Blend and Extend product. 
Now to Slide 7. As of the end of last year, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs was 6.1 gigawatts, half of which was under construction. Approximately 80% of the total or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split among hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. 
In terms of the 3 gigawatts that was under construction, I am pleased to announce that the 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering project achieved commercial operations on February 6. This project was completed ahead of time and slightly under budget and is helping to support the reliability of the grid in Southern California. The remaining 1.7 gigawatts under construction are renewables and energy storage. The majority of these projects are expected to come online in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. 
In addition to our 6.1-gigawatt backlog and the 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual renewable PPAs that we expect to sign, we see opportunities for attractive investments that are not currently included in our forecast, such as further rate-based growth at DPL and IPL as well as more renewables and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 9. Another example of how we are achieving sustainable growth is AES Gener, which is one of our most important businesses. AES Gener is transforming its portfolio by growing its wind and solar businesses and strengthening its balance sheet. Under its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener is negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of its thermal contract and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. 
In 2018, AES Gener announced its Green Blend and Extend strategy. And today, I'm pleased to report that since then, it has executed 2.5 gigawatts of long-term renewable contracts, the majority of which were signed in the last 12 months. As a result, AES Gener has significantly diversified its generation mix and has positioned itself to deliver attractive long-term growth. Specifically, these new contracts will more than double its renewable capacity and largely offset the roll-off of legacy contracts in Chile through 2024. 
In Colombia, AES Gener is successfully expanding from a single hydro asset to a broader portfolio, which will include wind and solar. AES Gener will primarily serve its Green Blend and Extend contracts through a combination of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and its existing portfolio. We expect these new projects to deliver mid-teen returns to AES. In addition to this new capacity, the Alto Maipo hydroelectric complex will be substantially completed by the end of this year and will help supply these new PPAs. Gustavo will discuss how AES Gener will fund the 1.6 gigawatts of new investments, including AES participation. 
Now to Slide 10 and the second theme of our strategy. In addition to growing our core infrastructure business, we're also developing new solutions to meet increasing customer demand for 24/7 renewable power and greater energy efficiency. Our focus is on solutions that are scalable and relatively capital-light, which allow us to work with our customers to co-create applications that meet their most critical energy needs. 
A key platform for us in this area is our energy storage business, Fluence, which continues to be the global market leader. Through this partnership with Siemens, we are well positioned to benefit from the expected 15 to 20 gigawatts of annual growth in energy storage globally. Today, we're already seeing that nearly half of our solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. 
In 2019, Fluence won contracts for 961 megawatts and has tripled its backlog since 2018 to a record of 1.2 gigawatts, which equates to roughly $1 billion in revenue. Fluence is cash- and margin-positive and is continuing to expand its capabilities, including modular, prefab and solar DC-coupled products to address new market opportunities. 
Across all of our platforms, we've also been incorporating innovative applications. An example is a 10-megawatt, 5-hour duration energy storage facility at AES Gener's Alfalfal hydro plant in Chile. This groundbreaking project will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world, providing the run-of-the-river plant with capabilities similar to a traditional reservoir. AES Gener expects to inaugurate this project in March, and it has the potential to increase this virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts. 
Turning to Slide 11. Last quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business lines. We're actively working together to develop new solutions to accelerate a broader adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. This alliance also encompasses energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. 
Now to Slide 12. Our strategic investment in Uplight continues to grow rapidly. As a reminder, Uplight provides utilities with a suite of digital services, including an online marketplace. These solutions improve end customer experiences while helping utilities balance energy demand and reduce service costs. This business now works with over 80 electric and gas utilities and reaches over 100 million households and businesses in the United States. Uplight has over $100 million in sales in 2019 with solid margin and continues to fund growth without additional equities. We see Uplight as very well positioned to benefit enormously from continued growth in cloud-based digital solutions in all aspects of energy management. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13 and the third theme of our strategy, superior results. As we invest in sustainable growth and offer innovative solutions to our customers, we are transforming our portfolio while achieving superior financial results. 
In late 2019, we received our first investment-grade rating and expect that we will receive another investment-grade rating this year. Additionally, through 2022, our portfolio is expected to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders. This return includes our dividend, which has grown by 30% over the last 5 years, and we expect it will continue to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
Having the right energy mix is key to our future success. This morning, we announced a target to reduce our generation from coal to below 30% of our total volume by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce generation from coal to less than 10% of our total by 2030. We are also committed to providing timely and accurate ESG data. We were the first U.S. investor-owned company in our sector to publish a climate scenario report, consistent with the recommendations of a task force on climate-related financial disclosures. Additionally, we currently provide a substantial portion of the disclosures recommended by SASB and expect to provide virtually all of the remaining data by the end of this year. 
We're beginning to see the benefit of attracting a wider investor base that appreciates AES' growth in clean energy and innovation while maintaining consistent financial performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Gustavo, let me address the issue of COVID-19 or the coronavirus. As a long-term contracted generator, overwhelmingly in U.S. dollars and the U.S. utility business, we see limited impact from most likely scenarios from the coronavirus epidemic. Furthermore, as I have previously laid out, AES has a strong pipeline of contracted, mostly renewable projects, that ensure our growth over the coming years. Although we may suffer some delivery delays, both our solar and energy storage businesses have largely secured their supplies of lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic sales for this year. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to ensure the resiliency of our business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achievin",1661,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achieving the upper end range of our adjusted EPS and setting a solid foundation for growth. As shown on Slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.36 primarily reflecting growth at our regulated utilities, contribution from new businesses, including renewables in AES Colón, and a lower tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the asset dispositions, including 2.6 gigawatt of coal-fired generation. 
Turning to Slide 16. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $55 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 17. 
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, this PTC reflects regulated rate cases completed in 2018 as well as contributions from new renewables projects. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of coal-fired generation at Shady Point and DPL. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and asset sales, partially offset by better operating results at Guacolda and lower interest expense in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the commencement of operations at AES Colón and better contracted prices in Panama as well as insurance recovery in the Dominican Republic and Panama net of outage costs. Importantly, these facilities in the DR and Panama have resumed operations at full capacity. 
I would now like to discuss briefly the resilience of our portfolio. This was the worst hydrological year on record in Panama, but the financial impact was significantly lower than in years past due to actions we have taken to improve our portfolio. The addition of AES Colón not only diversifies our fuel mix but also lowers the hydrologic exposure and spot price volatility of the entire system. This is just one example of how our capital allocation strategy has enabled us to lower our overall EPS risk from hydrology, foreign currency and commodities by 70% since 2011. 
Turning back to PTC in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect asset sales in the United Kingdom, Philippines and Netherlands. 
Now to Slide 21. Before moving on, I wanted to provide a couple of business updates, starting with DPL in Ohio. As you may know in November, the distribution modernization rider in DPL's electric security plan was removed, and we reverted back to ESP 1. The net impact of this decision reduced PTC by about $50 million annually. Roughly $25 million of this relates to costs that would have been recovered through a distribution investment rider. We expect it to start collecting this again in 2022 after new distribution rates have been filed and approved. 
In addition, as part of the order to revert to ESP 1, DPL needs to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test seat in April. This test of customer for regulated utilities in Ohio and use it to assess regulated returns. We feel good about our ability to pass the test and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
Although the overall tariff reduction last year was disappointing, AES continues to be fully committed to DPL, and we look forward to resuming our discussions around smart grid and other modernization investment opportunities. DPL has the lowest residential tariff in Ohio, and we believe there continue to be significant opportunities to improve value to our customers. We expect that you'll have more  details about DPL's investment plan in the following quarters. 
Regarding Argentina, yesterday, the new administration announced anticipated reforms. As part of that, all-in prices have been reduced by about 15% to 20%, and the regulated tariffs have been linked to Argentina peso with local inflation adjustments. This is in line with our expectations following last year's election, and it is fully reflected in our guidance and expectations for 2022 and beyond. 
Importantly, we have also had some positive developments that work to offset the regulatory changes in Ohio and Argentina, highlighting once again the resilience of our portfolio. This includes the potential extension of our existing legacy generation at Southland, early efficiency gains from our cost savings and digital initiatives and opportunistic refinancings, leveraging a historical low interest rate environment. Regarding Southland, approval is still pending by the state water board and local permitting authorities and is expected for the second half of this year. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 22. Since 2011, we have reduced our current debt by $3.1 billion or 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x, and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. After having attained our first investment-grade rating in November, we continue to expect a second upgrade this year. 
Turning to our 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 23, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash. This is largely consistent with our previous call, with the exception of the announced Jordan sale, which we now expected to close in the first half of this year. 
Now to use on the right-hand side. Roughly 60% of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt reduction and the remaining amount we invested in our subsidiaries primarily in our renewables backlog. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 24. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Growth this year will be driven by the completion of our 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering, which came online earlier this month and a full year of operations at OPGC 2 in India. Continued growth in renewals, including 1.5 gigawatt scheduled to reach commercial operations this year, efficiency gains from cost cutting and our digital initiatives and a lower interest expense due to refinancing benefits and completed debt reduction. This growth will be partially offset by the reversion to ESP 1 at DPL Ohio, reduced tariffs in Argentina and a slightly higher tax rate. I will note that much of our growth will begin contributing later in the year, and our EPS is expected to be more weighted towards the second half. For instance, although Southland came online this month, it will be operating on a merchant basis until the PPA begins in June. 
Turning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $725 million to $775 million this year and is expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022 off a 2018 base. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, including roughly $750 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $550 million in asset sale proceeds. 
Moving to the uses in the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the $180 million of temporary drawing on our revolver. Our credit metrics are very strong and we'll continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $750 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the Green Blend and Extend strategy at AES Gener. As Andrés mentioned, AES Gener has been successfully executing its decarbonization strategy by securing 2.5 gigawatt of renewable energy contracts. This includes growth in Colombia, where AES Gener is diversifying away from a single hydro asset to include new wind and solar resources. This replicates what AES has done in other markets such as Panama, where the addition of AES Colón diversified our portfolio and materially enhanced the value of our existing assets. 
As a result of its successful strategy execution, today, AES Gener announced a $500 million equity issuance to help fund it's $1.8 billion renewable growth program. And AES will be participating with our pro rata share of approximately $335 million. We believe this investment will create significant value to our shareholders and will allow AES Gener to remain an important contributor for AES' earnings and cash flow for years to come. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. This reflects an increase in targeted asset sales of roughly $400 million since our last call, which is fully incorporated in our guidance for the year and in the 7% to 9% growth rate. Given the range of opportunities we have, we feel confident in achieving this additional sales target in the next few years. 
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 28. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.6 billion to invest in our backlog, new project PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investments in AES Gener acquisitions. Once completed, this project should contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $400 million of unallocated cash is largely weighted towards 2022 and will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. 
Based on the significant transformation we have achieved at AES in the last several years, we now have a much stronger balance sheet and portfolio of assets. As such, we are well positioned to capitalize on our leadership in the global energy transition while delivering very solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we open the call to your questions, I will summarize the key points we have made this morning. Through the actions we have taken over the last several years, we have greatly enhanced the resiliency of our portfolio. In 2019, this was reflected in our financial performance as well as the investment-grade rating we achieved. By adding 2.8 gigawatts of renewables to our backlog, we have cemented our position as the leader in the global transition to cleaner energy. By successfully executing on its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener signed 2.5 gigawatts of renewable contracts. These contracts will ensure strong earnings at AES Gener by largely offsetting the roll-off of legacy contracts expiring through 2024. 
We are also accelerating a cleaner energy future by delivering innovative solutions through Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. We are targeting a reduction in coal generation to below 30% by the end of this year and to less than 10% by 2030. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022, which along with our growing dividend, will deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders.

So you've seen a further uptick in the CapEx in renewables, does that put you in a different place relative to that range? How do you think about your disclosed CapEx at this $8 billion mark relative to achieving your longer-term targets? And again, this is more of, as you ramp up, how do you think about where you are within that range? And then maybe a sub-point on that is how should we think about that global renewables investment relative to the capital raise at Gener? I suspect it's a different number than the CapEx on that front."

So in the case of AES Gener, the capital raise is to fund the very successful Green Blend and Extend. We've gotten 2.5 gigawatts of Green Blend and Extend PPAS. This is good for the existing assets. This is good for us because we get these long-term contracted renewables. Average life is around 17 years. 
So that is what we're raising the capital for. That's -- because that's up and above. We did very well in doing that, and Gener needs to raise the money. And it basically will largely offset the roll-off of existing thermal contracts that Gener has through 2024. So that's one thing. So basically, the capital raise at Gener and our participation, we think it's a good investment. These are renewable contracts in dollars, inflation-adjusted. And we want to fund that growth and really move Gener into the -- a sustainable long-term future. 
Regarding our other investments -- now this basically keeps us on the targets that we have given before. So we're on target. We are successfully delivering on these renewables. And what we're seeing is our investments in some of the most -- or innovative fields, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Uplight, are going to help us achieve those renewable goals and also achieve our financial targets. 
So it's all coming together very nicely. And what this really is allowing us to do is to beat our financial guidance and commitments while at the same time decarbonizing even faster. So that really is, I'd say, a big story. 
I think Gustavo will add something."

What will continue in 2021 is what's called Volcan, which is basically just to bring additional water to the project. But the project will have its full capacity of 531 megawatts. 
But what is very interesting also is this first virtual reservoir, which we have 10 megawatts up and running. And the regulation is in place. It's 5-year batteries, and that it will allow us to dispatch this run-of-the-river plant differently, take advantage of differences in daily pricing. And if this goes well, we could expand this from 10 megawatts to 240, which would be really substantial. So realize that the Alto Maipo together with Alfalfal, so together, this is 750 megawatts of hydro, close to the load center of Chile in Santiago. It really will be a terrific asset."

Anybody who you will talk to will talk about, whether it's the U.S., whether it's India, tens of gigawatts of energy storage, which is needed to be able to operate the greater numbers of renewables. And the technology keeps improving. We're coming out with new products. We'll be launching them this year, which will help lower costs. And for example, prefab, modular, et cetera. So that's very exciting. 
Now getting to valuation. As I've said in the past, we would like and to really get a marker by having our capital raise at Fluence, so that you can see what was the value created. So as you know, we feel that there's a lot of values being created. We think it would be a unique asset in the market. There's nothing else similar to it. So we're working on that. 
Regarding Uplight, we first bought Simple Energy and then we merged it with Uplight. And the valuation that we got from Simple Energy in that merger was up about 100% from what we paid in less than 2 years. So Uplight is, again, doing many things for a lot of people in terms of being really a cloud-based digital services provider for utilities, really the leader in the field. And it's also helping us with our cost savings and quality improvement as well. So that one will probably be longer term. I mean we're already seeing the benefits in terms of our own operations in terms of the things that we can offer. 
And you're right, especially in the case of Google, there's not that much that we can disclose other than this involves, as I said, energy management, providing them with energy. We have our first PPA in Chile to provide them with renewable power. And what's very interesting to them is really our ability to provide 24/7 renewables. So we're working on a number of fields with them. And in all of these is how we really get a competitive edge in renewables, that -- combining that with our existing platforms and existing client relationships."

In 2019, we earned $1.36 of adjusted EPS, 10% higher than in 2018 and toward the top end of our range of $1.30 to $1.38. We are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022. In 2019, after reducing our parent debt by half, we were upgraded to an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. In 2019, we completed construction of 2.2 gigawatts of new projects. We also signed 2.8 gigawatts of renewable contracts, bringing our backlog to 6.1 gigawatts. This pace puts us on track to nearly triple our portfolio of renewables in operation to 22 gigawatts by the end of 2024 versus 2016. 
We achieved critical milestones in expanding our LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Vietnam. To accelerate a broader adoption of clean energy, we are delivering innovative energy solutions through our leading platforms, including Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. 
Considering our success to date in substantially lowering our carbon intensity, today, I'm announcing a target to reduce our coal-fired generation to below 30%, measured in megawatt hours by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce it to less than 10% by 2030. 
Turning now to our strategy on Slide 4. We spent the last several years positioning AES to lead the energy transition and cementing our place as a top renewables developer throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, I will discuss the 3 core themes of our strategy: investing in sustainable growth, offering innovative solutions and delivering superior results. 
Through our strong presence in key markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the global transition towards more sustainable energy. In these markets, we see growth in clean energy of 30 gigawatts per year. By capitalizing on our competitive position and the dynamics favoring clean power generation, we have had great success in increasing our backlog of signed PPAs. 
Turning now to that backlog of projects, beginning on Slide 5. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 gigawatts, of which approximately half is wind, 40% is solar and 10% is energy storage. 40% of this capacity is in the U.S. and 60% is located internationally. 
Turning to Slide 6, beginning with the U.S. Our sPower and AES Distributed Energy businesses maintained their momentum by adding more than 1 gigawatt of new long-term contracted renewable projects to our backlog. The rate of growth from our distributed energy business is particularly impressive. In 2019, it signed 365 megawatts under long-term PPAs, 3x more than in 2018. One of the reasons for this business' success is its deep knowledge of customers in specific markets, including Hawaii and the Northeastern U.S. For example, in Hawaii, we delivered the world's largest solar-plus-storage project. And during the year, we were awarded an additional 205 megawatts of similar projects. 
As a reminder, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, such as our presence in growth markets and our 25 gigawatts of development pipeline, including land and interconnection rights; our ability to bring low-cost capital to optimize AES' return on equity; and our relationship with key customers, including those for whom we are implementing our Green Blend and Extend product. 
Now to Slide 7. As of the end of last year, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs was 6.1 gigawatts, half of which was under construction. Approximately 80% of the total or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split among hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. 
In terms of the 3 gigawatts that was under construction, I am pleased to announce that the 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering project achieved commercial operations on February 6. This project was completed ahead of time and slightly under budget and is helping support the reliability of the grid in Southern California. The remaining 1.7 gigawatts under construction are renewables and energy storage. The majority of these projects are expected to come online in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. 
In addition to our 6.1-gigawatt backlog and the 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual renewable PPAs that we expect to sign, we see opportunities for attractive investments that are not currently included in our forecast, such as further rate-based growth at DPL and IPL as well as more renewables and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 9. Another example of how we are achieving sustainable growth is AES Gener, which is one of our most important businesses. AES Gener is transforming its portfolio by growing its wind and solar businesses and strengthening its balance sheet. Under its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener is negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of its thermal contract and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. 
In 2018, AES Gener announced its Green Blend and Extend strategy. And today, I'm pleased to report that since then, it has executed 2.5 gigawatts of long-term renewable contracts, the majority of which were signed in the last 12 months. As a result, AES Gener has significantly diversified its generation mix and has positioned itself to deliver attractive long-term growth. Specifically, these new contracts will more than double its renewable capacity and largely offset the roll-off of legacy contracts in Chile through 2024. 
In Colombia, AES Gener is successfully expanding from a single hydro asset to a broader portfolio, which will include wind and solar. AES Gener will primarily serve its Green Blend and Extend contracts through a combination of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and its existing portfolio. We expect these new projects to deliver mid-teen returns to AES. In addition to this new capacity, the Alto Maipo hydroelectric complex will be substantially completed by the end of this year and will help supply these new PPAs. Gustavo will discuss how AES Gener will fund the 1.6 gigawatts of new investments, including AES' participation. 
Now to Slide 10 and the second theme of our strategy. In addition to growing our core infrastructure business, we're also developing new solutions to meet increasing customer demand for 24/7 renewable power and greater energy efficiency. Our focus is on solutions that are scalable and relatively capital-light, which allow us to work with our customers to co-create applications that meet their most critical energy needs. 
A key platform for us in this area is our energy storage business, Fluence, which continues to be the global market leader. Through this partnership with Siemens, we are well positioned to benefit from the expected 15 to 20 gigawatts of annual growth in energy storage globally. Today, we're already seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. 
In 2019, Fluence won contracts for 961 megawatts and has tripled its backlog since 2018 to a record of 1.2 gigawatts, which equates to roughly $1 billion in revenue. Fluence is cash- and margin-positive and is continuing to expand its capabilities, including modular, prefab and solar DC cups products to address new market opportunities. 
Across all of our platforms, we've also been incorporating innovative applications. An example is a 10-megawatt, 5-hour duration energy storage facility at AES Gener's Alfalfal hydro plant in Chile. This groundbreaking project will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world, providing the run-of-the-river plant with capabilities similar to a traditional reservoir. AES Gener expects to inaugurate this project in March, and it has the potential to increase this virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts. 
Turning to Slide 11. Last quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business lines. We're actively working together to develop new solutions to accelerate a broader adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. This alliance also encompasses energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. 
Now to Slide 12. Our strategic investment in Uplight continues to grow rapidly. As a reminder, Uplight provides utilities with a suite of digital services, including an online marketplace. These solutions improve end customer experiences while helping utilities balance energy demand and reduce service costs. This business now works with over 80 electric and gas utilities and reaches over 100 million households and businesses in the United States. Uplight has over $100 million in sales in 2019 with solid margin and continues to fund growth without additional equity needs. We see Uplight as very well positioned to benefit enormously from continued growth in cloud-based digital solutions in all aspects of energy management. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13 and the third theme of our strategy, superior results. As we invest in sustainable growth and offer innovative solutions to our customers, we are transforming our portfolio while achieving superior financial results. 
In late 2019, we received our first investment-grade rating and expect that we will receive another investment-grade rating this year. Additionally, through 2022, our portfolio is expected to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders. This return includes our dividend, which has grown by 30% over the last 5 years, and we expect it will continue to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
Having the right energy mix is key to our future success. This morning, we announced a target to reduce our generation from coal to below 30% of our total volume by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce generation from coal to less than 10% of our total by 2030. We are also committed to providing timely and accurate ESG data. We were the first U.S. investor-owned company in our sector to publish a climate scenario report, consistent with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. Additionally, we currently provide a substantial portion of the disclosures recommended by FASB and expect to provide virtually all of the remaining data by the end of this year. 
We're beginning to see the benefit of attracting a wider investor base that appreciates AES' growth in clean energy and innovation while maintaining consistent financial performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Gustavo, let me address the issue of COVID-19 or the coronavirus. As a long-term contracted generator, overwhelmingly in U.S. dollars and the U.S. utility business, we see limited impact from most likely scenarios from the coronavirus epidemic. Furthermore, as I have previously laid out, AES has a strong pipeline of contracted, mostly renewable projects, that ensure our growth over the coming years. Although we may suffer some delivery delays, both our solar and energy storage businesses have largely secured their supplies of lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic sales for this year. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to ensure the resiliency of our business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."
35312,652705400,1938711,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 28, 2020",2020-02-28,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achievin",1662,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achieving the upper end range of our adjusted EPS and setting a solid foundation for growth. As shown on Slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.36 primarily reflecting growth at our regulated utilities, contribution from new businesses, including renewables in AES Colón, and a lower tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the asset dispositions, including 2.6 gigawatt of coal-fired generation. 
Turning to Slide 16. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $55 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 17.
The U.S. and Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects regulated rate cases completed in 2018 as well as contributions from new renewables projects. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of coal-fired generation at Shady Point and DPL. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and asset sales, partially offset by better operating results at Guacolda and lower interest expense in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the commencement of operations at AES Colón and better contracted prices in Panama as well as insurance recovery in the Dominican Republic and Panama net of outage costs. Importantly, these facilities in the DR and Panama have resumed operations at full capacity. 
I would now like to discuss briefly the resilience of our portfolio. This was the worst hydrological year on record in Panama, but the financial impact was significantly lower than in years past due to actions we have taken to improve our portfolio. The addition of AES Colón not only diversifies our fuel mix but also lowers the hydrologic exposure and spot price volatility of the entire system. This is just one example of how our capital allocation strategy has enabled us to lower our overall EPS risk from hydrology, foreign currency and commodities by 70% since 2011. 
Turning back to PTC in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect asset sales in the United Kingdom, Philippines and Netherlands. 
Now to Slide 21. Before moving on, I wanted to provide a couple of business updates, starting with DPL in Ohio. As you may know in November, the distribution modernization rider in DPL's electric security plan was removed, and we reverted back to ESP 1. The net impact of this decision reduced PTC by about $50 million annually. Roughly $25 million of this relates to costs that would have been recovered through a distribution investment rider. We expect it to start collecting this again in 2022 after new distribution rates have been filed and approved. 
In addition, as part of the order to revert to ESP 1, DPL needs to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test seat in April. This test of customer for regulated utilities in Ohio and use it to assess regulated returns. We feel good about our ability to pass these tests and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
Although the overall tariff reduction last year was disappointing, AES continues to be fully committed to DPL, and we look forward to resuming our discussions around smart grid and other modernization investment opportunities. DPL has the lowest residential tariff in Ohio, and we believe there continue to be significant opportunities to improve value to our customers. We expect that you'll have more details about DPL's investment plan in the following quarters. 
Regarding Argentina, yesterday, the new administration announced anticipated reforms. As part of that, all-in prices have been reduced by about 15% to 20%, and the regulated tariffs have been linked to Argentina peso with local inflation adjustments. This is in line with our expectations following last year's election, and it is fully reflected in our guidance and expectations for 2022 and beyond. 
Importantly, we have also had some positive developments that work to offset the regulatory changes in Ohio and Argentina, highlighting once again the resilience of our portfolio. This includes the potential extension of our existing legacy generation at Southland, early efficiency gains from our cost savings and digital initiatives and opportunistic refinancings, leveraging a historical low interest rate environment. Regarding Southland, approval is still pending by the state water board and local permitting authorities and is expected for the second half of this year. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 22. Since 2011, we have reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion or 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x, and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. After having attained our first investment-grade rating in November, we continue to expect a second upgrade this year. 
Turning to our 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 23, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash. This is largely consistent with our previous call, with the exception of the announced Jordan sale, which we now expected to close in the first half of this year. 
Now to use on the right-hand side. Roughly 60% of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt reduction and the remaining amount we invested in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 24. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Growth this year will be driven by the completion of our 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering, which came online earlier this month and a full year of operations at OPGC 2 in India. Continued growth in renewals, including 1.5 gigawatt is scheduled to reach commercial operations this year, efficiency gains from cost cutting and our digital initiatives and a lower interest expense due to refinancing benefits and completed debt reduction. This growth will be partially offset by the reversion to ESP 1 at DPL in Ohio, reduced tariffs in Argentina and a slightly higher tax rate. 
I will note that much of our growth will begin contributing later in the year, and our EPS is expected to be more weighted towards the second half. For instance, although Southland came online this month, it will be operating on a merchant basis until the PPA begins in June. 
Turning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $725 million to $775 million this year and is expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022 off a 2018 base. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, including roughly $750 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $550 million in asset sale proceeds. 
Moving to the uses in the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the $180 million of temporary drawing on our revolver. Our credit metrics are very strong and we'll continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $750 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the Green Blend and Extend strategy at AES Gener. 
As Andrés mentioned, AES Gener has been successfully executing its decarbonization strategy by securing 2.5 gigawatt of renewable energy contracts. This includes growth in Colombia, where AES Gener is diversifying away from the single hydro asset to include new wind and solar resources. This replicates what AES has done in other markets such as Panama, where the addition of AES Colón diversified our portfolio and materially enhanced the value of our existing assets. 
As a result of its successful strategy execution, today, AES Gener announced a $500 million equity issuance to help fund it's $1.8 billion renewable growth program. And AES will be participating with our pro rata share of approximately $335 million. We believe this investment will create significant value to our shareholders and will allow AES Gener to remain an important contributor for AES' earnings and cash flow for years to come. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. This reflects an increase in targeted asset sales of roughly $400 million since our last call, which is fully incorporated in our guidance for the year and in the 7% to 9% growth rate. Given the range of opportunities we have, we feel confident in achieving this additional sales target in the next few years. 
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 28. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.6 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investments in AES Gener acquisitions. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $400 million of unallocated cash is largely weighted towards 2022 and will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
Based on the significant transformation we have achieved at AES in the last several years, we now have a much stronger balance sheet and portfolio of assets. As such, we are well positioned to capitalize on our leadership in the global energy transition while delivering very solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

How do you think about your disclosed CapEx at this $8 billion mark relative to achieving your longer-term targets? 
And again, this is more of, as you ramp up, how do you think about where you are within that range? And then maybe a sub-point on that is how should we think about that global renewables investment relative to the capital raise at Gener? I suspect it's a different number than the CapEx on that front."

So in the case of AES Gener, the capital raise is to fund the very successful Green Blend and Extend. We've gotten 2.5 gigawatts of Green Blend and Extend PPAs. This is good for the existing assets. This is good for us because we get these long-term contracted renewables. Average life is around 17 years.
So that is what we're raising the capital for. That's -- because that's up and above. We did very well in doing that, and Gener needs to raise the money. And it basically will largely offset the roll-off of existing thermal contracts that Gener has through 2024. So that's one thing. So basically, the capital raise at Gener and our participation, we think it's a good investment. These are renewable contracts in dollars, inflation-adjusted. And we want to fund that growth and really move Gener into the -- a sustainable long-term future. 
Regarding our other investments -- now this basically keeps us on the targets that we have given before. So we're on target. We are successfully delivering on these renewables. And what we're seeing is our investments in some of the most -- more innovative fields, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Uplight, are going to help us achieve those renewable goals and also achieve our financial targets. 
So it's all coming together very nicely. And what this really is allowing us to do is to meet our financial guidance and commitments, while at the same time decarbonizing even faster. 
So that really is, I'd say, a big story. I think Gustavo will add something."

What will continue in 2021 is what's called Volcán, which is basically just to bring additional water to the project. But the project will have its full capacity of 531 megawatts. 
But what is very interesting also is this first virtual reservoir, which we have 10 megawatts up and running. And the regulation is in place. It's 5-hour batteries, and then it will allow us to dispatch this run-of-the-river plant differently, take advantage of differences in daily pricing. And if this goes well, we could expand this from 10 megawatts to 240, which would be really substantial. So realize that the Alto Maipo together with Alfalfal, so together, this is 750 megawatts of hydro, close to the load center of Chile in Santiago. So it really will be a terrific asset."

Anybody you will talk to will talk about, whether it's the U.S., whether it's India, tens of gigawatts of energy storage, which is needed to be able to operate the greater numbers of renewables. And the technology keeps improving. We're coming out with new products. We'll be launching them this year, which will help lower costs. And for example, prefab, modular, et cetera. So that's very exciting.
Now getting to valuation. As I've said in the past, we would like and to really get a marker by having our capital raise at Fluence, so that you can see what was the value created. So as you know, we feel that there's a lot of values being created. We think it would be a unique asset in the market. There's nothing else similar to it. So we're working on that. 
Regarding Uplight, we first bought Simple Energy and then we merged it with Uplight. And the valuation that we got from Simple Energy in that merger was up about 100% from what we paid in less than 2 years. So Uplight is, again, doing many things for a lot of people in terms of being really a cloud-based digital services provider for utilities, really the leader in the field. And it's also helping us with our cost savings and quality improvement as well. So that one, probably, longer term. I mean we're already seeing the benefits in terms of our own operations in terms of the things that we can offer. 
And you're right, especially in the case of Google, there's not that much that we can disclose other than this involves, as I said, energy management, providing them with energy. We have our first PPA in Chile to provide them with renewable power. And what's very interesting to them is really our ability to provide 24/7 renewables. So we're working on a number of fields with them. And in all of these is how we really get a competitive edge in renewables, that -- combining that with our existing platforms and existing client relationships."

Today, I will discuss our 2019 performance and our strategy to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. I'll begin with some of the key highlights for this call on Slide 3. 
In 2019, we earned $1.36 of adjusted EPS, 10% higher than in 2018 and toward the top end of our range of $1.30 to $1.38. We are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022. In 2019, after reducing our parent debt by half, we were upgraded to an investment-grade rating for the first time in AES' history. In 2019, we completed construction of 2.2 gigawatts of new projects. We also signed 2.8 gigawatts of renewable contracts, bringing our backlog to 6.1 gigawatts. This pace puts us on track to nearly triple our portfolio of renewables in operation to 22 gigawatts by the end of 2024 versus 2016. 
We achieved critical milestones in expanding our LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Vietnam. To accelerate a broader adoption of clean energy, we are delivering innovative energy solutions through our leading platforms, including Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. 
Considering our success to date in substantially lowering our carbon intensity, today, I'm announcing a target to reduce our coal-fired generation to below 30%, measured in megawatt hours by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce it to less than 10% by 2030. 
Turning now to our strategy on Slide 4. We spent the last several years positioning AES to lead the energy transition and cementing our place as a top renewables developer throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, I will discuss the 3 core themes of our strategy: investing in sustainable growth, offering innovative solutions and delivering superior results. 
Through our strong presence in key markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the global transition towards more sustainable energy. In these markets, we see growth in clean energy of 30 gigawatts per year. By capitalizing on our competitive position and the dynamics favoring clean power generation, we have had great success in increasing our backlog of signed PPAs. 
Turning now to that backlog of projects, beginning on Slide 5. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 gigawatts, of which approximately half is wind, 40% is solar and 10% is energy storage. 40% of this capacity is in the U.S. and 60% is located internationally. 
Turning to Slide 6, beginning with the U.S. Our sPower and AES Distributed Energy businesses maintained their momentum by adding more than 1 gigawatt of new long-term contracted renewable projects to our backlog. The rate of growth from our distributed energy business is particularly impressive. In 2019, it signed 365 megawatts under long-term PPAs, 3x more than in 2018. One of the reasons for this business' success is its deep knowledge of customers in specific markets, including Hawaii and the Northeastern U.S. For example, in Hawaii, we delivered the world's largest solar-plus-storage project. And during the year, we were awarded an additional 205 megawatts of similar projects. 
As a reminder, our renewable investments are expected to produce low- to high-teen IRRs across our markets, assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, such as our presence in growth markets and our 25 gigawatts of development pipeline, including land and interconnection rights; our ability to bring low-cost capital to optimize AES' return on equity; and our relationship with key customers, including those for whom we are implementing our Green Blend and Extend product. 
Now to Slide 7. As of the end of last year, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs was 6.1 gigawatts, half of which was under construction. Approximately 80% of the total or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split among hydro, solar, wind and energy storage. 
In terms of the 3 gigawatts that was under construction, I am pleased to announce that the 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering project achieved commercial operations on February 6. This project was completed ahead of time and slightly under budget and is helping support the reliability of the grid in Southern California. The remaining 1.7 gigawatts under construction are renewables and energy storage. The majority of these projects are expected to come online in 2020 and the remainder in 2021. 
In addition to our 6.1-gigawatt backlog and the 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual renewable PPAs that we expect to sign, we see opportunities for attractive investments that are not currently included in our forecast, such as further rate-based growth at DPL and IPL as well as more renewables and energy storage. 
Turning to Slide 9. Another example of how we are achieving sustainable growth is AES Gener, which is one of our most important businesses. AES Gener is transforming its portfolio by growing its wind and solar businesses and strengthening its balance sheet. Under its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener is negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of its thermal contract and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. 
In 2018, AES Gener announced its Green Blend and Extend strategy. And today, I'm pleased to report that since then, it has executed 2.5 gigawatts of long-term renewable contracts, the majority of which were signed in the last 12 months. As a result, AES Gener has significantly diversified its generation mix and has positioned itself to deliver attractive long-term growth. Specifically, these new contracts will more than double its renewable capacity and largely offset the roll-off of legacy contracts in Chile through 2024. 
In Colombia, AES Gener is successfully expanding from a single hydro asset to a broader portfolio, which will include wind and solar. AES Gener will primarily serve its Green Blend and Extend contracts through a combination of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewable capacity and its existing portfolio. We expect these new projects to deliver mid-teen returns to AES. In addition to this new capacity, the Alto Maipo hydroelectric complex will be substantially completed by the end of this year and will help supply these new PPAs. Gustavo will discuss how AES Gener will fund the 1.6 gigawatts of new investments, including AES' participation. 
Now to Slide 10 and the second theme of our strategy. In addition to growing our core infrastructure business, we're also developing new solutions to meet increasing customer demand for 24/7 renewable power and greater energy efficiency. Our focus is on solutions that are scalable and relatively capital-light, which allow us to work with our customers to co-create applications that meet their most critical energy needs. 
A key platform for us in this area is our energy storage business, Fluence, which continues to be the global market leader. Through this partnership with Siemens, we are well positioned to benefit from the expected 15 to 20 gigawatts of annual growth in energy storage globally. Today, we're already seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. 
In 2019, Fluence won contracts for 961 megawatts and has tripled its backlog since 2018 to a record of 1.2 gigawatts, which equates to roughly $1 billion in revenue. Fluence is cash- and margin-positive and is continuing to expand its capabilities, including modular, prefab and solar DC cups products to address new market opportunities. 
Across all of our platforms, we've also been incorporating innovative applications. An example is a 10-megawatt, 5-hour duration energy storage facility at AES Gener's Alfalfal hydro plant in Chile. This groundbreaking project will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world, providing the run-of-the-river plant with capabilities similar to a traditional reservoir. AES Gener expects to inaugurate this project in March, and it has the potential to increase this virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts. 
Turning to Slide 11. Last quarter, we announced a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business lines. We're actively working together to develop new solutions to accelerate a broader adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers. This alliance also encompasses energy management and opportunities to develop, own and operate projects in targeted markets to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. 
Now to Slide 12. Our strategic investment in Uplight continues to grow rapidly. As a reminder, Uplight provides utilities with a suite of digital services, including an online marketplace. These solutions improve end customer experiences while helping utilities balance energy demand and reduce service costs. This business now works with over 80 electric and gas utilities and reaches over 100 million households and businesses in the United States. Uplight has over $100 million in sales in 2019 with solid margin and continues to fund growth without additional equity needs. We see Uplight as very well positioned to benefit enormously from continued growth in cloud-based digital solutions in all aspects of energy management. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13 and the third theme of our strategy, superior results. As we invest in sustainable growth and offer innovative solutions to our customers, we are transforming our portfolio while achieving superior financial results. 
In late 2019, we received our first investment-grade rating and expect that we will receive another investment-grade rating this year. Additionally, through 2022, our portfolio is expected to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders. This return includes our dividend, which has grown by 30% over the last 5 years, and we expect it will continue to increase by 4% to 6% annually. 
Having the right energy mix is key to our future success. This morning, we announced a target to reduce our generation from coal to below 30% of our total volume by the end of this year. Furthermore, we expect to reduce generation from coal to less than 10% of our total by 2030. We are also committed to providing timely and accurate ESG data. We were the first U.S. investor-owned company in our sector to publish a climate scenario report, consistent with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. Additionally, we currently provide a substantial portion of the disclosures recommended by FASB and expect to provide virtually all of the remaining data by the end of this year. 
We're beginning to see the benefit of attracting a wider investor base that appreciates AES' growth in clean energy and innovation while maintaining consistent financial performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Gustavo, let me address the issue of COVID-19 or the coronavirus. As a long-term contracted generator, overwhelmingly in U.S. dollars and the U.S. utility business, we see limited impact from most likely scenarios from the coronavirus epidemic. Furthermore, as I have previously laid out, AES has a strong pipeline of contracted, mostly renewable projects that ensure our growth over the coming years. Although we may suffer some delivery delays, both our solar and energy storage businesses have largely secured their supplies of lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic sales for this year. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to ensure the resiliency of our business. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail."

Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achievin",1662,"Thank you, Andrés. Today, I'll cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
As Andrés mentioned, we finished 2019 on a strong note, achieving the upper end range of our adjusted EPS and setting a solid foundation for growth. As shown on Slide 15, adjusted EPS was $1.36 primarily reflecting growth at our regulated utilities, contribution from new businesses, including renewables in AES Colón, and a lower tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the asset dispositions, including 2.6 gigawatt of coal-fired generation. 
Turning to Slide 16. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $55 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning on Slide 17.
The U.S. and Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects regulated rate cases completed in 2018 as well as contributions from new renewables projects. These impacts were partially offset by the exit of coal-fired generation at Shady Point and DPL. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and asset sales, partially offset by better operating results at Guacolda and lower interest expense in Chile. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the commencement of operations at AES Colón and better contracted prices in Panama as well as insurance recovery in the Dominican Republic and Panama net of outage costs. Importantly, these facilities in the DR and Panama have resumed operations at full capacity. 
I would now like to discuss briefly the resilience of our portfolio. This was the worst hydrological year on record in Panama, but the financial impact was significantly lower than in years past due to actions we have taken to improve our portfolio. The addition of AES Colón not only diversifies our fuel mix but also lowers the hydrologic exposure and spot price volatility of the entire system. This is just one example of how our capital allocation strategy has enabled us to lower our overall EPS risk from hydrology, foreign currency and commodities by 70% since 2011. 
Turning back to PTC in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect asset sales in the United Kingdom, Philippines and Netherlands. 
Now to Slide 21. Before moving on, I wanted to provide a couple of business updates, starting with DPL in Ohio. As you may know in November, the distribution modernization rider in DPL's electric security plan was removed, and we reverted back to ESP 1. The net impact of this decision reduced PTC by about $50 million annually. Roughly $25 million of this relates to costs that would have been recovered through a distribution investment rider. We expect it to start collecting this again in 2022 after new distribution rates have been filed and approved. 
In addition, as part of the order to revert to ESP 1, DPL needs to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test seat in April. This test of customer for regulated utilities in Ohio and use it to assess regulated returns. We feel good about our ability to pass these tests and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
Although the overall tariff reduction last year was disappointing, AES continues to be fully committed to DPL, and we look forward to resuming our discussions around smart grid and other modernization investment opportunities. DPL has the lowest residential tariff in Ohio, and we believe there continue to be significant opportunities to improve value to our customers. We expect that you'll have more details about DPL's investment plan in the following quarters. 
Regarding Argentina, yesterday, the new administration announced anticipated reforms. As part of that, all-in prices have been reduced by about 15% to 20%, and the regulated tariffs have been linked to Argentina peso with local inflation adjustments. This is in line with our expectations following last year's election, and it is fully reflected in our guidance and expectations for 2022 and beyond. 
Importantly, we have also had some positive developments that work to offset the regulatory changes in Ohio and Argentina, highlighting once again the resilience of our portfolio. This includes the potential extension of our existing legacy generation at Southland, early efficiency gains from our cost savings and digital initiatives and opportunistic refinancings, leveraging a historical low interest rate environment. Regarding Southland, approval is still pending by the state water board and local permitting authorities and is expected for the second half of this year. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 22. Since 2011, we have reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion or 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x, and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. After having attained our first investment-grade rating in November, we continue to expect a second upgrade this year. 
Turning to our 2019 parent capital allocation on Slide 23, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash. This is largely consistent with our previous call, with the exception of the announced Jordan sale, which we now expected to close in the first half of this year. 
Now to use on the right-hand side. Roughly 60% of our discretionary cash was allocated to shareholder dividend and debt reduction and the remaining amount we invested in our subsidiaries, primarily in our renewables backlog. 
Turning to our guidance on Slide 24. Today, we are initiating guidance for 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Growth this year will be driven by the completion of our 1.3-gigawatt Southland repowering, which came online earlier this month and a full year of operations at OPGC 2 in India. Continued growth in renewals, including 1.5 gigawatt is scheduled to reach commercial operations this year, efficiency gains from cost cutting and our digital initiatives and a lower interest expense due to refinancing benefits and completed debt reduction. This growth will be partially offset by the reversion to ESP 1 at DPL in Ohio, reduced tariffs in Argentina and a slightly higher tax rate. 
I will note that much of our growth will begin contributing later in the year, and our EPS is expected to be more weighted towards the second half. For instance, although Southland came online this month, it will be operating on a merchant basis until the PPA begins in June. 
Turning to Slide 25. Parent free cash flow is expected to be from $725 million to $775 million this year and is expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022 off a 2018 base. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, including roughly $750 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $550 million in asset sale proceeds. 
Moving to the uses in the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the $180 million of temporary drawing on our revolver. Our credit metrics are very strong and we'll continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $750 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the Green Blend and Extend strategy at AES Gener. 
As Andrés mentioned, AES Gener has been successfully executing its decarbonization strategy by securing 2.5 gigawatt of renewable energy contracts. This includes growth in Colombia, where AES Gener is diversifying away from the single hydro asset to include new wind and solar resources. This replicates what AES has done in other markets such as Panama, where the addition of AES Colón diversified our portfolio and materially enhanced the value of our existing assets. 
As a result of its successful strategy execution, today, AES Gener announced a $500 million equity issuance to help fund its $1.8 billion renewable growth program. And AES will be participating with our pro rata share of approximately $335 million. We believe this investment will create significant value to our shareholders and will allow AES Gener to remain an important contributor for AES' earnings and cash flow for years to come. 
Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. This reflects an increase in targeted asset sales of roughly $400 million since our last call, which is fully incorporated in our guidance for the year and in the 7% to 9% growth rate. Given the range of opportunities we have, we feel confident in achieving this additional sales target in the next few years. 
Turning to the use of this discretionary cash on Slide 28. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.6 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investments in AES Gener acquisitions. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $400 million of unallocated cash is largely weighted towards 2022 and will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.
Based on the significant transformation we have achieved at AES in the last several years, we now have a much stronger balance sheet and portfolio of assets. As such, we are well positioned to capitalize on our leadership in the global energy transition while delivering very solid financial performance for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we open the call to your questions, I will summarize the key points we have made this morning. Through the actions we have taken over the last several years, we have greatly enhanced the resiliency of our portfolio. In 2019, this was reflected in our financial performance as well as the investment-grade rating we achieved. By adding 2.8 gigawatts of renewables to our backlog, we have cemented our position as the leader in the global transition to cleaner energy. By successfully executing on its Green Blend and Extend strategy, AES Gener signed 2.5 gigawatts of renewable contracts. These contracts will ensure strong earnings at AES Gener by largely offsetting the roll-off of legacy contracts expiring through 2024. 
We are also accelerating a cleaner energy future by delivering innovative solutions through Fluence, Uplight and our strategic alliance with Google. We are targeting a reduction in coal generation to below 30% by the end of this year and to less than 10% by 2030. 
Finally, we are reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2022, which along with our growing dividend, will deliver double-digit total returns to our shareholders. 
Operator, we're now ready to take your questions."

So you've seen a further uptick in the CapEx in renewables, does that put you in a different place relative to that range? How do you think about your disclosed CapEx at this $8 billion mark relative to achieving your longer-term targets? 
And again, this is more of, as you ramp up, how do you think about where you are within that range? And then maybe a sub-point on that is how should we think about that global renewables investment relative to the capital raise at Gener? I suspect it's a different number than the CapEx on that front."

So in the case of AES Gener, the capital raise is to fund the very successful Green Blend and Extend. We've gotten 2.5 gigawatts of Green Blend and Extend PPAs. This is good for the existing assets. This is good for us because we get these long-term contracted renewables. Average life is around 17 years.
So that is what we're raising the capital for. That's -- because that's up and above. We did very well in doing that, and Gener needs to raise the money. And it basically will largely offset the roll-off of existing thermal contracts that Gener has through 2024. So that's one thing. So basically, the capital raise at Gener and our participation, we think it's a good investment. These are renewable contracts in dollars, inflation-adjusted. And we want to fund that growth and really move Gener into the -- a sustainable long-term future. 
Regarding our other investments -- now this basically keeps us on the targets that we have given before. So we're on target. We are successfully delivering on these renewables. And what we're seeing is our investments in some of the most -- more innovative fields, whether it be Fluence, whether it be Uplight, are going to help us achieve those renewable goals and also achieve our financial targets. 
So it's all coming together very nicely. And what this really is allowing us to do is to meet our financial guidance and commitments, while at the same time decarbonizing even faster. 
So that really is, I'd say, a big story. I think Gustavo will add something."

What will continue in 2021 is what's called Volcán, which is basically just to bring additional water to the project. But the project will have its full capacity of 531 megawatts. 
But what is very interesting also is this first virtual reservoir, which we have 10 megawatts up and running. And the regulation is in place. It's 5-hour batteries, and then it will allow us to dispatch this run-of-the-river plant differently, take advantage of differences in daily pricing. And if this goes well, we could expand this from 10 megawatts to 240, which would be really substantial. So realize that the Alto Maipo together with Alfalfal, so together, this is 750 megawatts of hydro, close to the load center of Chile in Santiago. So it really will be a terrific asset."

Anybody you will talk to will talk about, whether it's the U.S., whether it's India, tens of gigawatts of energy storage, which is needed to be able to operate the greater numbers of renewables. And the technology keeps improving. We're coming out with new products. We'll be launching them this year, which will help lower costs. And for example, prefab, modular, et cetera. So that's very exciting.
Now getting to valuation. As I've said in the past, we would like and to really get a marker by having our capital raise at Fluence, so that you can see what was the value created. So as you know, we feel that there's a lot of values being created. We think it would be a unique asset in the market. There's nothing else similar to it. So we're working on that. 
Regarding Uplight, we first bought Simple Energy and then we merged it with Uplight. And the valuation that we got from Simple Energy in that merger was up about 100% from what we paid in less than 2 years. So Uplight is, again, doing many things for a lot of people in terms of being really a cloud-based digital services provider for utilities, really the leader in the field. And it's also helping us with our cost savings and quality improvement as well. So that one, probably, longer term. I mean we're already seeing the benefits in terms of our own operations in terms of the things that we can offer. 
And you're right, especially in the case of Google, there's not that much that we can disclose other than this involves, as I said, energy management, providing them with energy. We have our first PPA in Chile to provide them with renewable power. And what's very interesting to them is really our ability to provide 24/7 renewables. So we're working on a number of fields with them. And in all of these is how we really get a competitive edge in renewables, that -- combining that with our existing platforms and existing client relationships."

Today, I will discuss the current state of our business and our strategic goals going forward. We are well positioned to withstand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are seeing the benefits of our multiyear effort to enhance the resilience of our business. The vast majority of our earnings come from long-term contracted generation, which provides significant protection from the downturn in electricity demand and prices. 
Furthermore, our liquidity position is strong. We have no major near-term debt amortizations, and we continue to improve our investment-grade metrics. Our construction projects are progressing on schedule without any supply chain disruptions, and we are on track to grow our renewables backlog and achieve our environmental goals. 
The net effect of this is that despite seeing double-digit reductions in demand in some of our markets, we are lowering our earnings guidance for the year by only 5% to a range of $1.32 to $1.42. We are reaffirming our expectations for 2020 parent free cash flow and our longer-term growth projections for both adjusted EPS and current free cash flow. Gustavo will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, our liquidity and our guidance in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, I will focus my discussion on the 3 core themes of resilience, sustainable growth and leadership in innovation. Beginning on Slide 5 with the resilience. These are certainly unprecedented times with a global pandemic and a sharp economic downturn, resulting from restrictions on travel, mobility and work. Fortunately, for AES, as you may recall from our last quarterly call, we were closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and taking steps to reduce its impact on our business. 
We began to implement our plans for all nonessential personnel to work remotely by the first week of March, increased our stocks of fuel and PPE at our plants and work sites and built up cash liquidity at all levels of our portfolio. We also ensured that national and local governments recognize the critical importance of the service we provide and classified our operations as essential, facilitating the movement of personnel to our generation plants, utilities and construction sites. 
As a result of all of these early actions, we have continued to deliver our services without any significant impact and have minimized contagion among our people and contractors. To date, only 10 AES people out of a population of 9,000 have tested positive for the virus. And more importantly, none have become seriously ill or hospitalized. Of these, 5 have been deemed recovered and virus-free. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our resilience comes not just from our actions to address the crisis but from our fundamental business model. Across our portfolio, we have an average remaining contract life of 14 years. Approximately 70% of our business is long-term contracted generation with the vast majority in U.S. dollars or euros. Nearly all of our offtakers are investment grade, and our contracts are primarily for capacity with our revenue relatively unaffected by the actual energy produced. Thus, this part of our business is very resilient to a downturn in energy prices and demand. 
We have an additional 15% of our business, which is generation with shorter-term contracts, which has some modest exposure to spot prices. The remaining 15% of our business is regulated utilities, principally in the U.S., and this is where we have been most impacted by the decrease in demand. We saw a net reduction of around 10% in April, mainly from commercial and industrial customers, and we expect lower demand to continue for several months before recovering by early next year. 
We are taking measures to offset the reduction in 2020 earnings, primarily through cost savings that we are realizing from our digital initiatives. For example, investments we have made over the past [ 2 ] years have made it possible for much of our staff to work remotely, including many positions on the operational side. We expect some degree of remote work and the associated benefits to continue even in a post pandemic world. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to deliver additional cost savings of around $50 million this year, which Gustavo will cover in more detail. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and our second theme, sustainable growth, which continues to be a key area of focus. Despite the current crisis, we remain on track with our current growth projections and ambitions to triple our renewables portfolio by 2024 versus 2016. Our backlog is now 5.3 gigawatts, of which 1.8 gigawatts are currently under construction. Turning to Slide 8. Construction includes the 
531 megawatt hydro at Alto Maipo in Chile, which continues to progress according to our prior schedule. Phase 1 is now more than 93% complete. The turbines are in place and only 2.7 miles of tunneling out of a total of 46 remains to complete Phase 1 and start operations early next year. Of our more than 30 renewable projects under construction, only 2 small ones have been affected to date by the COVID-19 lockdown. Both are in upstate New York, where we had to temporarily stop work. 
Fortunately, as you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we took very early steps to ensure we had solar PV panels and our balance of plant in-country and at our construction sites as we foresaw potential supply chain bottlenecks in China and Korea. 
Turning to Slide 9. I am pleased to announce the start of commissioning of the world's most efficient solar project, Andes Solar in Chile, which at 37% has the world's highest capacity factor as a result of using bifacial PV panels and a high solar irradiation, combined with the low temperatures of the Atacama desert. 
Building on our innovation in solar, we are bringing a new prefabricated PV design to our projects, starting with an initial 10 megawatts in Chile. We are finalizing a strategic partnership with a company that has a patented design that not only allows for construction to be completed in half the time but can also double the energy output per acre versus today's best-in-class project designs. We expect to expand this solar PV technology to many of our projects in the future to allow for faster construction, more efficient use of land and new C&I offerings. 
Regarding new PPA signed, so far this year, we have added approximately 700 megawatts of new renewable PPAs to our backlog, mostly in Chile and the U.S. Thanks to our leadership in innovation, we continue to see mid-teen levered returns on our renewable projects at the stand-alone project level. We are on track to deliver between 2 and 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs this year and growth in demand for smaller projects in the U.S. remains especially strong. In Chile and Colombia, our green blend and extend strategy has resulted in 2.5 gigawatts of new PPAs and the construction of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewables. 
Now on to Slide 10. In addition to wind and solar, our Energy Storage business also continues to grow rapidly, both through our own projects and through Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, which sells energy storage systems to third parties. Both aspects of our business are benefiting from an acceleration in demand for battery based systems. Today, about half of our solar bids in the U.S. include an energy storage component. New markets and application also continue to emerge, such as Virginia's 3.1 gigawatt energy storage mandate and Germany's plan to add up to 6 gigawatts to support the transmission network. 
Even in the midst of the current crisis, in early April, we signed a 15-year PPA for 100 megawatts of 4-hour duration energy storage in Southern California through sPower. I'm also very proud that we will soon be commissioning the world's first virtual reservoir at the Alfalfal hydro complex just outside Santiago, Chile. This virtual reservoir consists of 10 megawatts of 5-hour batteries, which allow for dispatching the run of the river hydro largely at night when solar power is not available and energy prices are higher. We will be increasing this virtual reservoir to 250 megawatts over the next couple of years, and there are several smaller virtual reservoir projects in late-stage development in the U.S. 
Fluence currently has an all-time high of 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage systems under construction, which include some of the largest projects in the world. This year, we will be rolling out our sixth generation energy storage technology platform. It is both factory assembled and modular, and will improve reliability, increase the speed of execution and lower costs. 
Through our growth in renewables and energy storage, we continue to make progress towards our ambitious environmental goals. As you can see on Slide 11, we remain committed to reducing our coal generation to less than 30% of our gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which will make us compliant with ESG standards set by Norges Bank, among other institutions. We expect to realize this target through the continued sale and decommissioning of coal plants, along with the execution of our extensive backlog of renewable projects. 
Finally, turning to our leadership and innovation on Slide 12. We continue to move forward on a number of innovative solutions that we see as highly relevant for the long-term future of the industry. One example is Uplight, which, as a reminder, works with more than 80 electric and gas utilities in the U.S., reaching more than 100 million households and businesses, providing a suite of digital solutions. 
We expect revenue growth of 30% this year, fueled in part by utilities' desire to improve customers' experiences in a capital-efficient digital way. 
Another example of our innovation is our partnership with Google, which is progressing well. We continue to make headway on a number of initiatives that we will be in a position to announce in the near future. 
Now I would like to pass the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. In the first quarter, we made good pro",1821,"Thank you, Andres. Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
In the first quarter, we made good progress on our key financial metrics. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EPS was $0.29 versus $0.28 in Q1 2019, in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher contributions from the MCAC SBU, largely due to improved availability and hydrology in Panama as well as lower effective tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the reversion to prior rates at DPL in Ohio and mild weather at our regulated utilities in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $250 million for the quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the first quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 16. 
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as mild weather at both DPL and IPL. These impacts were partially offset by contributions from new renewable projects. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by lower interest expense and realized FX gains in Chile, partially offset by a planned major outage at our hydro plant in Colombia as part of a larger project to extend its useful life. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the return to operations at our Sanginel hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage in 2019, as well as improved availability at our Colon plant. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019. 
Finally, in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the United Kingdom. 
Before moving on, I want to provide an update on the DP&L in Ohio on Slide '20. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, after reverting to previous ESP 1 rates, the DP&L was required to pass certain regulatory tasks, including the significantly excessive earnings test, or SEET. In April, DP&L began this process by filing an application with the commission. There is a comment period set for July and potential hearing, if needed, set for October. A final ruling is expected by early 2021. We feel good about our ability to best this test and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
As we have said in the past, AES continues to be fully committed to the DP&L. We are now planning to invest approximately $900 million in its grid over the next 4 years, including base distribution, transmission and its market investments, which will lead to low double-digit rate base growth through 2023. To that end, AES plans to invest $300 million of new equity in the DP&L, half of it this year and the other half in 2021. These investments will allow DP&L to continue to provide safe and reliable service, while materially improving the experience we deliver to our customers and preserving very competitive rates. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide '21. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, between 2011 and 2019, we reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion, which is about 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x and our FFO to debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. Currently, we have $800 million of borrowings under the revolver, roughly half of which was drawn as precautionary measure to reinforce our cash position. 
We expected to end the year with a 0 revolver balance and credit metrics that are even stronger than in 2019. We are also maintaining our regular dialogue with the rating agencies and continue to be on track to receive our second investment-grade rating. While the fundamental credit strength of AES remains unchanged, given the current macro environment, we believe the timing of this upgrade is now more likely to be closer to year-end. 
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 22. In times of uncertainty, we recognize that cash is king. To that end, we are in the strongest financial position of our history. We have $3.3 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. This is more than sufficient to meet any unforeseen needs over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our receivables on Slide 23, which have remained stable over the last few years. We have been monitoring our receivables very closely to ensure they are within the 45- to 60-day grace period allowed under our contracts. And so far, through April, they are in line. It is worthwhile to mention that in a few of our markets, governments have declared a payment moratorium for certain residential utility clients as the lockdown is in place. While we are mostly removed from this impact as a generator, this could create some additional working capital needs at certain businesses. To that end, we are working with multilateral organizations, such as the Inter American Development Bank to create mechanism for securitizing receivables in these markets. 
Now turning to our refinancing needs in 2020 on Slide 24. As you may know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. In fact, just last year, we executed more than $5 billion in liability management across our portfolio. As a result, we have only $300 million of debt to be refinanced for the remainder of the year, most of which is at our U.S. utilities. We are pleased to see investor interest in the $407 million IPALCO refinanced we recently completed, with the deal being 5x oversubscribed, reducing our refinancing needs to just over $300 million for the remainder of the year. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 25. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the temporary drawings on our revolver, which was $180 million at the end of 2019. 
Our credit metrics are strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $565 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the $150 million investment in grid modernization at DPL this year. This leave us with up to $452 million to be allocated. The amount is largely a function of the asset sales we plan to close this year. The use of this cash may include investment in AES Gener, Green Blend & Extend strategy, as we discussed on our last call. The timing of this investment is dependent on AES Gener's funding needs, so it may be later this year or early next year. 
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 26. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash, 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. 
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 27. Roughly, 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new project and PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener, I just discussed. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L, which is incremental to our last call. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. 
Finally, turning to our guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on Slide 28. As Andres mentioned, AES is well positioned to weather this storm due to the actions we have taken over the last several years to improve the resilience of our portfolio. So let me start first with the impact from commodities and FX. 
Despite significant volatility in both markets, we are expecting an impact of only $0.03. This is because today, our business is mostly contracted and denominated in U.S. dollars, materially reducing our exposure. We are also forecasting a $0.02 impact due to a higher interest expense as a result of drawing on our revolving credit facilities to reinforce our liquidity. Like many other companies in our sector, we are also seeing an impact on demand, primarily at our regulated utilities, including IPL and DPL, where we do not currently benefit from the coupling protection. In April, we saw C&I demand decline in the mid-teens at both businesses, with a partial offset of about 6% from an increased residential demand, where we have better margins. 
Internationally, demand has dropped 5% to 15% in our key markets. But again, in those markets, our model is mostly based on take-or-pay contracts or tolling agreements with limited exposure to demand. The impact from lower demand across our portfolio is expected to be $0.07 in 2020. 
Although projecting future load, GDP recovery is very challenging in this unprecedented times, we are currently assuming demand will have an extended U-shaped recovery with a mid-teens average decline across our portfolio in the second quarter, high single digits in the third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter, not returning to precrisis levels until next year. As a reference, and assuming our current geographic mix, a 1% change in the year to go demand translates into an approximately $0.01 impact on our full year earnings. 
We have also been working very hard on potential levers to offset this impact and are expecting an incremental cost savings in the year of about $0.05. As Andres mentioned, most of these savings are coming from our digital and laser-focused cost control initiatives. This includes reduced maintenance and lower fixed costs and G&A. 
Turning to Slide 29. As a result, we are reducing the midpoint of our guidance by 5% or $0.07 with a new range of $1.32 to $1.42. On the parent free cash flow side, we are not seeing an impact versus our previously communicated goal of $725 million to $775 million as a result of the strength and diversification of our portfolio. We are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate through 2022. Although it is disappointing to revise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, the limited impact we are seeing in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, illustrates the current strength of our portfolio and balance sheet. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our portfolio of largely long-term contracted generation is resilient in the current pandemic and related economic downturn. Therefore, we remain on track to achieve our strategic goals of greening our portfolio, leading in new technologies and attaining a second investment-grade rating. We have already taken steps this year to strengthen our liquidity and further reduce costs to mitigate the impact on earnings from decreases in our sales. 
Although we expect a 5% reduction in this year's earnings, we are reaffirming our 2020 parent free cash flow and longer-term growth rates in earnings, cash and dividends. We expect to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash through 2022, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit returns to our shareholders. 
And finally, I would like to thank the people of AES, who through their discipline and hard work are ensuring safe, reliable and affordable energy in all of the markets we serve.

If things are more severe, we are in a resilient case. And of course, we have more latitude on different levers that we can pull. I would add that because what we did very early on was increase our liquidity, we have about $0.02 of having that additional liquidity on hand. But I think that was the right thing to do given that there was a lot of uncertainty. 
So the -- in terms of -- we have a very good track record of cost controls and reductions. And I think that, again, we will react given to how we see the situation evolving. Now we did mention $0.05 this year, mostly from our digital initiatives. And I think that we have learned how to work remotely. And there are more digital tools that we can implement, and we expect to -- that these savings will continue into next year. So we have some continued additional upside because that's really not in next year's numbers."

So let's take maybe sort of the Latin American region. So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries.

So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries. So there's a number of things. First, in general, they were quite quick lock down. Brazil was an exception to that and Mexico. But in most countries, the lockdown was quite severe and quite early. 
Second, they will be lifting these restrictions. But in general, the pandemic has been less severe in those countries than it has in the developed world. What we do know about the pandemic is that the, quite frankly, biggest drivers are age. And the second is obesity rates. So when you think of age, a lot of these countries have an average age of 30, which is very different from an average age of almost 50 in some of the developed countries. So the pandemic will have a different effect there. 
So I'd say the main difference is how much fiscal stimulus can they apply to react to that. So what we're seeing is -- again, it varies by country, but some of the smaller countries have had pretty aggressive fiscal stimulus. And they have gone out and basically assured the liquidity in countries like Panama, for example, have assured the liquidity on hand. 
And then Gustav also mentioned that we have worked with the -- even though we're not in most cases, not directly affected because it's more at the distribution company level, but we've also been working with multilateral institutions to have windows to a discount accounts receivable. But the vast bulk of our clients are multinationals, investment-grade multinationals in these countries. 
So taking a specific case of Brazil, I mean, as of yet, we have -- it's in one of those countries in the range that Gustavo talked about, between sort of 5% to 15% of our key countries. In Brazil, it's different very much state to state. Brazil is 1 of the countries where we don't have the long-term contracts. They tend to be shorter-term contracts. So there has been some effect there in Brazil, and it's also the 1 of the ones that we have in local currency. Brazil is obviously 1 that's been affected. 
What is our feeling about it? I think, again, in general, these countries will open up. The effects of the pandemic will be somewhat different because of the demographics of it. Personally, I think that 1 of the things to watch is commodity prices. Because that will maybe even have a bigger effect than some of the shutdowns, given the large informal sectors that these countries have. 
You mentioned Argentina. Argentina is doing very well on the shutdown in terms of its few cases, very controlled cases. And I would say that the main thing to watch in Argentina is debt refinancing or debt restructuring, let's say, that they're undergoing now. You will notice that our parent free cash flow is unchanged, but we have a decrease in earnings. One of the -- that's reflecting in part Argentina, where you've had significant devaluations. And you've had some degradation of our tariffs. But we weren't expecting to get any dividends out of it. 
One of the other businesses affected was the P&L, for example, where we don't expect any dividend. So that's -- I just wanted to explain why our cash remains unchanged and we're seeing a decrease in dividend. So regarding Latin America, in general, I'm pleased by the reaction of a lot of countries. The populations have been very supportive of their governments in that respect. And given the different demographics, it will evolve differently. So I do expect them to start opening up. Depends on the country. But later on this month and certainly by June. And the -- again, the reaction of a younger population will be different."

Today, I will discuss the current state of our business and our strategic goals going forward. We are well positioned to withstand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are seeing the benefits of our multiyear effort to enhance the resilience of our business. The vast majority of our earnings come from a long-term contracted generation, which provides significant protection from the downturn in electricity demand and prices. 
Furthermore, our liquidity position is strong. We have no major near-term debt amortizations, and we continue to improve our investment-grade metrics. Our construction projects are progressing on schedule without any supply chain disruptions, and we are on track to grow our renewables backlog and achieve our environmental goals. 
The net effect of all this is that despite seeing double-digit reductions in demand in some of our markets, we are lowering our earnings guidance for the year by only 5% to a range of $1.32 to $1.42. We are reaffirming our expectations for 2020 parent free cash flow and our longer-term growth projections for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. Gustavo will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, our liquidity and our guidance in more detail. 
Turning to Slide 4. Today, I will focus my discussion on the 3 core themes of resilience, sustainable growth and leadership in innovation. Beginning on Slide 5 with the resilience. These are certainly unprecedented times with a global pandemic and a sharp economic downturn, resulting from restrictions on travel, mobility and work. Fortunately, for AES, as you may recall from our last quarterly call, we were closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and taking steps to reduce its impact on our business. 
We began to implement our plans for all nonessential personnel to work remotely by the first week of March, increased our stocks of fuel and PPE at our plants and work sites and built up cash liquidity at all levels of our portfolio. We also ensured that national and local governments recognize the critical importance of the service we provide and classified our operations as essential, facilitating the movement of personnel to our generation plants, utilities and construction sites. 
As a result of all of these early actions, we have continued to deliver our services without any significant impact and have minimized contagion among our people and contractors. To date, only 10 AES people out of a population of 9,000 have tested positive for the virus. And more importantly, none have become seriously ill or hospitalized. Of these, 5 have been deemed recovered and virus free. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our resilience comes not just from our actions to address the crisis but from our fundamental business model. Across our portfolio, we have an average remaining contract life of 14 years. Approximately 70% of our business is long-term contracted generation with the vast majority in U.S. dollars or euros. Nearly all of our offtakers are investment grade, and our contracts are primarily for capacity with our revenue relatively unaffected by the actual energy produced. Thus, this part of our business is very resilient to a downturn in energy prices and demand. 
We have an additional 15% of our business, which is generation with shorter-term contracts, which has some modest exposure to spot prices. The remaining 15% of our business is regulated utilities, principally in the U.S., and this is where we have been most impacted by the decrease in demand. We saw a net reduction of around 10% in April, mainly from commercial and industrial customers, and we expect lower demand to continue for several months before recovering by early next year. 
We are taking measures to offset the reduction in 2020 earnings, primarily through cost savings that we are realizing from our digital initiatives. For example, investments we have made over the past few years have made it possible for much of our staff to work remotely, including many positions on the operational side. We expect some degree of remote work and the associated benefits to continue even in a post-pandemic world. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to deliver additional cost savings of around $50 million this year, which Gustavo will cover in more detail. 
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and our second theme, sustainable growth, which continues to be a key area of focus. Despite the current crisis, we remain on track with our current growth projections and ambitions to triple our renewables portfolio by 2024 versus 2016. Our backlog is now 5.3 gigawatts, of which, 1.8 gigawatts are currently under construction. Turning to Slide 8. Construction includes the 531 megawatt hydro at Alto Maipo in Chile, which continues to progress according to our prior schedule. Phase 1 is now more than 93% complete. The turbines are in place and only 2.7 miles of tunneling out of a total of 46 remains to complete Phase 1 and start operations early next year. Of our more than 30 renewable projects under construction, only 2 small ones have been affected to date by the COVID-19 lockdown. Both are in upstate New York, where we had to temporarily stop work. 
Fortunately, as you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we took very early steps to ensure we had solar PV panels and our balance of plant in-country and at our construction sites as we foresaw potential supply chain bottlenecks in China and Korea. 
Turning to Slide 9. I am pleased to announce the start of commissioning of the world's most efficient solar project, Andes Solar in Chile, which at 37% has the world's highest capacity factor as a result of using bifacial PV panels and a high solar irradiation, combined with the low temperatures of the Atacama Desert. 
Building on our innovation in Solar, we are bringing a new prefabricated PV design to our projects, starting with an initial 10 megawatts in Chile. We are finalizing a strategic partnership with a company that has a patented design that not only allows for construction to be completed in half the time, but can also double the energy output per acre versus today's best-in-class project designs. We expect to expand this solar PV technology to many of our projects in the future to allow for a faster construction, more efficient use of land and new C&I offerings. 
Regarding new PPAs signed, so far this year, we have added approximately 700 megawatts of new renewable PPAs to our backlog, mostly in Chile and the U.S. Thanks to our leadership in innovation, we continue to see mid-teen levered returns on our renewable projects at the stand-alone project level. We are on track to deliver between 2 and 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs this year, and growth in demand for smaller projects in the U.S. remains especially strong. In Chile and Colombia, our Green Blend and Extend strategy has resulted in 2.5 gigawatts of new PPAs and the construction of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewables. 
Now on to Slide 10. In addition to Wind and Solar, our energy storage business also continues to grow rapidly, both through our own projects and through Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, which sells energy storage systems to third parties. Both aspects of our business are benefiting from an acceleration in demand for battery-based systems. Today, about half of our solar bids in the U.S. include an energy storage component. New markets and application also continue to emerge, such as Virginia's 3.1 gigawatt energy storage mandate and Germany's plan to add up to 6 gigawatts to support the transmission network. 
Even in the midst of the current crisis, in early April, we signed a 15-year PPA for 100 megawatts of 4-hour duration energy storage in Southern California through sPower. I'm also very proud that we will soon be commissioning the world's first virtual reservoir at the Alfalfal hydro complex just outside Santiago, Chile. This virtual reservoir consists of 10 megawatts of 5-hour batteries, which allow for dispatching the run of the river hydro largely at night when solar power is not available and energy prices are higher. We will be increasing this virtual reservoir to 250 megawatts over the next couple of years, and there are several smaller virtual reservoir projects in late-stage development in the U.S. 
Fluence currently has an all-time high of 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage systems under construction, which include some of the largest projects in the world. This year, we will be rolling out our sixth generation energy storage technology platform. It is both factory assembled and modular, and will improve reliability, increase the speed of execution and lower costs. 
Through our growth in renewables and energy storage, we continue to make progress towards our ambitious environmental goals. As you can see on Slide 11, we remain committed to reducing our coal generation to less than 30% of our gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which will make us compliant with ESG standards set by Norges Bank, among other institutions. We expect to realize this target through the continued sale and decommissioning of coal plants, along with the execution of our extensive backlog of renewable projects. 
Finally, turning to our leadership and innovation on Slide 12. We continue to move forward on a number of innovative solutions that we see as highly relevant for the long-term future of the industry. One example is Uplight, which, as a reminder, works with more than 80 electric and gas utilities in the U.S., reaching more than 100 million households and businesses, providing a suite of digital solutions. 
We expect revenue growth of 30% this year, fueled in part by utilities' desire to improve customers' experiences in a capital-efficient digital way. 
Another example of our innovation is our partnership with Google, which is progressing well. We continue to make headway on a number of initiatives that we will be in a position to announce in the near future. 
Now I would like to pass the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022. 
In the first quarter, we made good progress on our key financial metrics. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EPS was $0.29 versus $0.28 in Q1 2019, in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher contributions from the MCAC SBU, largely due to improved availability and hydrology in Panama as well as lower effective tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the reversion to prior rates at DPL in Ohio and mild weather at our regulated utilities in the U.S. 
Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was $250 million for the quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the first quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 16. 
In the U.S. and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as mild weather at both DPL and IPL. These impacts were partially offset by contributions from new renewable projects. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by lower interest expense and realized FX gains in Chile, partially offset by a planned major outage at our hydro plant in Colombia as part of a larger project to extend its useful life. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the return to operations at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage in 2019 as well as improved availability at our Colon plant. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019. 
Finally, in Eurasia. Lower results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the United Kingdom. 
Before moving on, I want to provide an update on the DP&L in Ohio on Slide 20. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, after reverting to previous ESP 1 rates, the DP&L was required to pass certain regulatory tests, including the significantly excessive earnings test, or SEET. In April, DP&L began this process by filing an application with the commission. There is a comment period set for July and potential hearing, if needed, set for October. A final ruling is expected by early 2021. We feel good about our ability to pass this test and maintain ESP 1 rates. 
As we have said in the past, AES continues to be fully committed to DP&L. We are now planning to invest approximately $900 million in its grid over the next 4 years, including base distribution, transmission and its market investments, which will lead to low double-digit rate base growth through 2023. To that end, AES plans to invest $300 million of new equity in the DP&L, half of it this year and the other half in 2021. These investments will allow DP&L to continue to provide safe and reliable service, while materially improving the experience we deliver to our customers and preserving very competitive rates. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 21. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, between 2011 and 2019, we reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion, which is about 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x and our FFO to debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. Currently, we have $800 million of borrowings under the revolver, roughly half of which was drawn as precautionary measure to reinforce our cash position. 
We expect to end the year with a 0 revolver balance and credit metrics that are even stronger than in 2019. We are also maintaining our regular dialogue with the rating agencies and continue to be on track to receive our second investment-grade rating. While the fundamental credit strength of AES remains unchanged, given the current macro environment, we believe the timing of this upgrade is now more likely to be closer to year-end. 
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 22. In times of uncertainty, we recognize that cash is king. To that end, we are in the strongest financial position of our history. We have $3.3 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. This is more than sufficient to meet any unforeseen needs over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to our receivables on Slide 23, which have remained stable over the last few years. We have been monitoring our receivables very closely to ensure they are within the 45- to 60-day grace period allowed under our contracts. And so far, through April, they are in line. It is worthwhile to mention that in a few of our markets, governments have declared a payment moratorium for certain residential utility clients as the lockdown is in place. While we are mostly removed from this impact as a generator, this could create some additional working capital needs at certain businesses. To that end, we are working with multilateral organizations, such as the Inter-American Development Bank to create mechanism for securitizing receivables in these markets. 
Now turning to our refinancing needs in 2020 on Slide 24. As you may know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. In fact, just last year, we executed more than $5 billion in liability management across our portfolio. As a result, we have only $300 million of debt to be refinanced for the remainder of the year, most of which is at our U.S. Utilities. We are pleased to see investor interest in the $407 million IPALCO refinanced we recently completed, with the deal being 5x oversubscribed, reducing our refinancing needs to just over $300 million for the remainder of the year. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 25. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the temporary drawings on our revolver, which was $180 million at the end of 2019. 
Our credit metrics are strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $565 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the $150 million investment in grid modernization at DPL this year. This leave us with up to $452 million to be allocated. The amount is largely a function of the asset sales we plan to close this year. The use of this cash may include investment in AES Gener, Green Blend and Extend strategy, as we discussed on our last call. The timing of this investment is dependent on AES Gener's funding needs, so it may be later this year or early next year. 
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 26. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash, 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds. 
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 27. Roughly, 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener, I just discussed. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L, which is incremental to our last call. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. 
Finally, turning to our guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on Slide 28. As Andres mentioned, AES is well positioned to weather this storm due to the actions we have taken over the last several years to improve the resilience of our portfolio. So let me start first with the impact from commodities and FX. 
Despite significant volatility in both markets, we are expecting an impact of only $0.03. This is because today, our business is mostly contracted and denominated in U.S. dollars, materially reducing our exposure. We are also forecasting a $0.02 impact due to a higher interest expense as a result of drawing on our revolving credit facilities to reinforce our liquidity. Like many other companies in our sector, we are also seeing an impact on demand, primarily at our regulated utilities, including IPL and DPL, where we do not currently benefit from the coupling protection. In April, we saw C&I demand decline in the mid-teens at both businesses, with a partial offset of about 6% from an increased residential demand, where we have better margins. 
Internationally, demand has dropped 5% to 15% in our key markets. But again, in those markets, our model is mostly based on take-or-pay contracts or tolling agreements with limited exposure to demand. The impact from lower demand across our portfolio is expected to be $0.07 in 2020. 
Although projecting future load, our GDP recovery is very challenging in this unprecedented times, we are currently assuming demand will have an extended U-shaped recovery with a mid-teens average decline across our portfolio in the second quarter, high single digits in the third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter, not returning to precrisis levels until next year. As a reference, and assuming our current geographic mix, a 1% change in the year-to-go demand translates into an approximately $0.01 impact on our full year earnings. 
We have also been working very hard on potential levers to offset this impact and are expecting an incremental cost savings in the year of about $0.05. As Andres mentioned, most of these savings are coming from our digital and laser-focused cost control initiatives. This includes reduced maintenance and lower fixed costs and G&A. 
Turning to Slide 29. As a result, we are reducing the midpoint of our guidance by 5% or $0.07 with a new range of $1.32 to $1.42. On the parent free cash flow side, we are not seeing an impact versus our previously communicated goal of $725 million to $775 million as a result of the strength and diversification of our portfolio. We are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate through 2022. Although it is disappointing to revise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, the limited impact we are seeing in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, illustrates the current strength of our portfolio and balance sheet. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our portfolio of largely long-term contracted generation is resilient in the current pandemic and related economic downturn. Therefore, we remain on track to achieve our strategic goals of greening our portfolio, leading in new technologies and attaining a second investment-grade rating. We have already taken steps this year to strengthen our liquidity and further reduce costs to mitigate the impact on earnings from decreases in our sales. 
Although we expect a 5% reduction in this year's earnings, we are reaffirming our 2020 parent free cash flow and longer-term growth rates in earnings, cash and dividends. We expect to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash through 2022, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit returns to our shareholders.

So that's our assumption. So that really would -- is consistent with a U-shaped recovery or even a W-shaped recovery. 
If things are more severe, we are in a resilient case. And of course, we have more latitude on different levers that we can pull. I would add that because what we did very early on was increase our liquidity, we have about $0.02 of having that additional liquidity on hand. But I think that was the right thing to do given that there was a lot of uncertainty. 
So the -- in terms of -- we have a very good track record of cost controls and reductions. And I think that, again, we will react given to how we see the situation evolving. Now we did mention $0.05 additional this year, mostly from our digital initiatives. And I think that we have learned how to work remotely. And there are more digital tools that we can implement, and we expect to -- that these savings will continue into next year. So we have some continued additional upside because that's really not in next year's numbers."

So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries. So there's a number of things. First, in general, they were quite quick to lock down. Brazil was an exception to that and Mexico. But in most countries, the lockdown was quite severe and quite early. 
Second, they will be lifting these restrictions. But in general, the pandemic has been less severe in those countries than it has in the developed world. What we do know about the pandemic is that the -- quite frankly, biggest drivers are age. And the second is obesity rates. So when you think of age, a lot of these countries have an average age of 30, which is very different from an average age of almost 50 in some of the developed countries. So the pandemic will have a different effect there. 
So I'd say the main difference is how much fiscal stimulus can they apply to react to that. So what we're seeing is -- again, it varies by country, but some of the smaller countries have had pretty aggressive fiscal stimulus. And they have gone out and basically assured the liquidity. Countries like Panama, for example, have assured the liquidity on hand. 
And then Gustav also mentioned that we have worked with the -- even though we're not, in most cases, not directly affected because it's more at the distribution company level, but we've also been working with multilateral institutions to have windows to a discount accounts receivable. But the vast bulk of our clients are multinationals -- investment-grade multinationals in these countries. 
So taking the specific case of Brazil, I mean, as of yet, we have -- it's in the -- one of those countries in the range that Gustavo talked about, between sort of 5% to 15% of our key countries. In Brazil, it's different very much state to state. Brazil is one of the countries where we don't have the long-term contracts. They tend to be shorter-term contracts. So there has been some effect there in Brazil, and it's also the -- one of the ones that we have in local currency. Brazil's obviously one that's been affected. 
What is our feeling about it? I think, again, in general, these countries will open up. The effects of the pandemic will be somewhat different because of the demographics of it. Personally, I think that one of the things to watch is commodity prices because that will maybe even have a bigger effect than some of the shutdowns, given the large informal sectors that these countries have. 
You mentioned Argentina. Argentina is doing very well on the shutdown in terms of its few cases, very controlled cases. And I would say that the main thing to watch in Argentina is debt refinancing or debt restructuring, let's say, that they're undergoing now. [indiscernible] And you've had some degradation of our tariffs. And -- but we weren't expecting to get any dividends out of it. 
One of the other businesses affected was DP&L, for example, where we don't expect any dividend. So that's -- I just wanted to explain why our cash remains unchanged and we're seeing a decrease in dividend. So regarding Latin America, in general, I'm pleased by the reaction of a lot of countries. The populations have been very supportive of their governments in that respect. And given the different demographics, it will evolve differently. So I do expect them to start opening up. Depends on the country. But -- later on this month and certainly by June. And the -- again, the reaction of a younger population will be different."

Today, I will discuss the current state of our business and our strategic goals going forward. We are well positioned to withstand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are seeing the benefits of our multiyear effort to enhance the resilience of our business. The vast majority of our earnings come from long-term contracted generation, which provides significant protection from the downturn in electricity demand and prices. Furthermore, our liquidity position is strong. We have no major near-term debt amortizations, and we continue to improve our investment-grade metrics. Our construction projects are progressing on schedule without any supply chain disruptions, and we are on track to grow our renewables backlog and achieve our environmental goals. The net effect of all this is that despite seeing double-digit reductions in demand in some of our markets, we are lowering our earnings guidance for the year by only 5% to a range of $1.32 to $1.42. We are reaffirming our expectations for 2020 parent free cash flow and our longer-term growth projections for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. Gustavo will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, our liquidity and our guidance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, I will focus my discussion on the 3 core themes of resilience, sustainable growth and leadership in innovation.
Beginning on Slide 5 with the resilience. These are certainly unprecedented times with a global pandemic and a sharp economic downturn resulting from restrictions on travel, mobility and work. Fortunately, for AES, as you may recall from our last quarterly call, we were closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and taking steps to reduce its impact on our business. We began to implement our plans for all nonessential personnel to work remotely by the first week of March, increased our stocks of fuel and PPE at our plants and work sites and built up cash liquidity at all levels of our portfolio. We also ensured that national and local governments recognized the critical importance of the service we provide and classified our operations as essential, facilitating the movement of personnel for our generation plants, utilities and construction sites. As a result of all of these early actions, we have continued to deliver our services without any significant impact and have minimized contagion among our people and contractors. To date, only 10 AES people out of a population of 9,000 have tested positive for the virus. And more importantly, none have become seriously ill or hospitalized. Of these, 5 have been deemed recovered and virus free.
Turning to Slide 6. Our resilience comes not just from our actions to address the crisis but from our fundamental business model. Across our portfolio, we have an average remaining contract life of 14 years. Approximately 70% of our business is long-term contracted generation, with the vast majority in U.S. dollars or euros. Nearly all of our offtakers are investment grade, and our contracts are primarily for capacity, with our revenue relatively unaffected by the actual energy produced. Thus, this part of our business is very resilient to a downturn in energy prices and demand. We have an additional 15% of our business which is generation with shorter-term contracts, which has some modest exposure to spot prices. The remaining 15% of our business is regulated utilities, principally in the U.S., and this is where we have been most impacted by the decrease in demand.
We saw a net reduction of around 10% in April, mainly from commercial and industrial customers, and we expect lower demand to continue for several months before recovering by early next year. We are taking measures to offset the reduction in 2020 earnings, primarily through cost savings that we are realizing from our digital initiatives. For example, investments we have made over the past few years have made it possible for much of our staff to work remotely, including many positions on the operational side. We expect some degree of remote work and the associated benefits to continue even in a post-pandemic world. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to deliver additional cost savings of around $50 million this year, which Gustavo will cover in more detail.
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and our second theme, sustainable growth, which continues to be a key area of focus. Despite the current crisis, we remain on track with our current growth projections and ambitions to triple our renewables portfolio by 2024 versus 2016. Our backlog is now 5.3 gigawatts, of which 1.8 gigawatts are currently under construction. Turning to Slide 8: Construction includes the 531-megawatt hydro at Alto Maipo in Chile, which continues to progress according to our prior schedule. Phase 1 is now more than 93% complete. The turbines are in place and only 2.7 miles of tunneling out of a total 46 remains to complete Phase 1 and start operations early next year. Of our more than 30 renewable projects under construction, only 2 small ones have been affected to date by the COVID-19 lockdown. Both are in upstate New York, where we had to temporarily stop work. Fortunately, as you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we took very early steps to ensure we had solar PV panels and our balance of plants in country and at our construction sites as we foresaw potential supply chain bottlenecks in China and Korea.
Turning to Slide 9. I am pleased to announce the start of commissioning of the world's most efficient solar project, Andes solar in Chile, which at 37% has the world's highest capacity factor as a result of using bifacial PV panels and a high solar irradiation, combined with the low temperatures of the Atacama Desert.
Building on our innovation in solar, we are bringing a new prefabricated PV design to our projects, starting with an initial 10 megawatts in Chile. We are finalizing a strategic partnership with a company that has a patented design that not only allows for construction to be completed in half the time but can also double the energy output per acre versus today's best-in-class project designs. We expect to expand this solar PV technology to many of our projects in the future to allow for a faster construction, more efficient use of land and new C&I offerings. Regarding new PPAs signed, so far this year, we have added approximately 700 megawatts of new renewable PPAs to our backlog, mostly in Chile and the U.S. Thanks to our leadership in innovation, we continue to see mid-teen levered returns on our renewable projects at the stand-alone project level. We are on track to deliver between 2 and 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs this year, and growth in demand for smaller projects in the U.S. remains especially strong. In Chile and Colombia, our Green Blend and Extend strategy has resulted in 2.5 gigawatts of new PPAs and the construction of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewables.
Now on to Slide 10. In addition to wind and solar, our energy storage business also continues to grow rapidly, both through our own projects and through Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens which sells energy storage systems to third parties. Both aspects of our business are benefiting from an acceleration in demand for battery-based systems. Today, about half of our solar bids in the U.S. include an energy storage component. New markets and application also continue to emerge, such as Virginia's 3.1-gigawatt energy storage mandate and Germany's plan to add up to 6 gigawatts to support the transmission network. Even in the midst of the current crisis, in early April, we signed a 15-year PPA for 100 megawatts of 4-hour-duration energy storage in Southern California through sPower. I'm also very proud that we will soon be commissioning the world's first virtual reservoir at the Alfalfal hydro complex just outside Santiago, Chile. This virtual reservoir consists of 10 megawatts of 5-hour batteries, which allow for dispatching the ""run of the river"" hydro largely at night when solar power is not available and energy prices are higher. We will be increasing this virtual reservoir to 250 megawatts over the next couple of years, and there are several smaller virtual reservoir projects in late-stage development in the U.S.
Fluence currently has an all-time high of 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage systems under construction, which include some of the largest projects in the world. This year, we will be rolling out our sixth-generation energy storage technology platform. It is both factory assembled and modular; and will improve reliability, increase the speed of execution and lower costs. Through our growth in renewables and energy storage, we continue to make progress towards our ambitious environmental goals. As you can see on Slide 11, we remain committed to reducing our coal generation to less than 30% of our gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which will make us compliant with ESG standards set by Norges Bank, among other institutions. We expect to realize this target through the continued sale and decommissioning of coal plants, along with the execution of our extensive backlog of renewable projects.
Finally, turning to our leadership in innovation on Slide 12. We continue to move forward on a number of innovative solutions that we see as highly relevant for the long-term future of the industry. One example is Uplight, which, as a reminder, works with more than 80 electric and gas utilities in the U.S. reaching more than 100 million households and businesses, providing a suite of digital solutions. We expect revenue growth of 30% this year fueled in part by utilities' desire to improve customers' experiences in a capital-efficient digital way. Another example of our innovation is our partnership with Google, which is progressing well. We continue to make headway on a number of initiatives that we will be in a position to announce in the near future.
Now I would like to pass the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022.
In the first quarter, we made good progress on our key financial metrics. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EPS was $0.29 versus $0.28 in Q1 2019, in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher contributions from the MCAC SBU, largely due to improved availability and hydrology in Panama as well as lower effective tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the reversion to prior rates at DPL in Ohio and mild weather at our regulated utilities in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $250 million for the quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the first quarter of 2019.
I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as mild weather at both DPL and IPL. These impacts were partially offset by contributions from new renewable projects. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by lower interest expense and realized FX gains in Chile, partially offset by a planned major outage at our hydro plant in Colombia as part of a larger project to extend its useful life. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the return to operations at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage in 2019, as well as improved availability at our Colon plant. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the United Kingdom.
Before moving on, I want to provide an update on DP&L in Ohio on Slide 20. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, after reverting to previous ESP 1 rates, DP&L was required to pass certain regulatory tests, including the significantly excessive earnings test or SEET. In April, DP&L began this process by filing an application with the commission. There is a comment period set for July and potential hearing, if needed, set for October. A final ruling is expected by early 2021. We feel good about our ability to pass this test and maintain ESP 1 rates. As we have said in the past, AES continues to be fully committed to DP&L. We are now planning to invest approximately $900 million in its grid over the next 4 years, including base distribution, transmission and smart grid investments, which will lead to low double-digit rate base growth through 2023. To that end, AES plans to invest $300 million of new equity in DP&L, half of it this year and the other half in 2021. These investments will allow DP&L to continue to provide safe and reliable service while materially improving the experience we deliver to our customers and preserving very competitive rates.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 21. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, between 2011 and 2019, we reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion, which is about 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. Currently, we have $800 million of borrowings under the revolver, roughly half of which was drawn as precautionary measure to reinforce our cash position. We expect to end the year with a 0 revolver balance and credit metrics that are even stronger than in 2019. We are also maintaining our regular dialogue with the rating agencies and continue to be on track to receive our second investment-grade rating. While the fundamental credit strength of AES remains unchanged, given the current macro environment, we believe the timing of this upgrade is now more likely to be closer to year-end.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 22. In times of uncertainty, we recognize that cash is king. To that end, we are in the strongest financial position of our history. We have $3.3 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. This is more than sufficient to meet any unforeseen needs over the remainder of the year.
Turning to our receivables on Slide 23, which have remained stable over the last few years. We have been monitoring our receivables very closely to ensure they are within the 45- to 60-day grace period allowed under our contracts. And so far, through April, they are in-line. It is worthwhile to mention that in a few of our markets, governments have declared a payment moratorium for certain residential utility clients as the lockdown was in place. While we are mostly removed from this impact as a generator, this could create some additional working capital needs at certain businesses. To that end, we are working with multilateral organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank to create mechanisms for securitizing receivables in these markets.
Now turning to our refinancing needs in 2020 on Slide 24. As you may know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. In fact, just last year, we executed more than $5 billion in liability management across our portfolio. As a result, we have only $300 million of debt to be refinanced for the remainder of the year, most of which is at our U.S. utilities. We are pleased to see investor interest in the $407 million IPALCO refinanced we recently completed, with the deal being 5x oversubscribed, reducing our refinancing needs to just over $300 million for the remainder of the year.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 25, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the temporary drawings on our revolver, which was $180 million at the end of 2019. Our credit metrics are strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $565 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the $150 million investment in grid modernization at DPL this year. These leave us with up to $452 million to be allocated. The amount is largely a function of the asset sales we plan to close this year. The use of this cash may include investment in AES Gener's Green Blend and Extend strategy, as we discussed on our last call. The timing of this investment is dependent on AES Gener's funding needs, so it may be later this year or early next year.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 26. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 27. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener I just discussed. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L, which is incremental to our last call. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
Finally, turning to our guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on Slide 28. As Andrés mentioned, AES is well positioned to weather this storm due to the actions we have taken over the last several years to improve the resilience of our portfolio.
So let me start first with the impact from commodities and FX. Despite significant volatility in both markets, we are expecting an impact of only $0.03. This is because today our business is mostly contracted and denominated in U.S. dollars, materially reducing our exposure. We are also forecasting a $0.02 impact due to a higher interest expense as a result of drawing on our revolving credit facilities to reinforce our liquidity. Like many other companies in our sector, we are also seeing an impact on demand, primarily at our regulated utilities, including IPL and DPL, where we do not currently benefit from [ decoupling protection ]. In April, we saw C&I demand decline in the mid-teens at both businesses, with a partial offset of about 6% from an increased residential demand, where we have better margins. Internationally, demand has dropped 5% to 15% in our key markets. But again, in those markets, our model is mostly based on take-or-pay contracts or tolling agreements with limited exposure to demand. The impact from lower demand across our portfolio is expected to be $0.07 in 2020.
Although projecting future loads or GDP recovery is very challenging in these unprecedented times, we are currently assuming demand will have an extended U-shaped recovery with a mid-teens average decline across our portfolio in the second quarter, high single digits in the third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter, not returning to precrisis levels until next year. As a reference and assuming our current geographic mix, a 1% change in the [ year-to-go ] demand translates into an approximately $0.01 impact on our full year earnings. We have also been working very hard on potential levers to offset this impact and are expecting an incremental cost savings in the year of about $0.05. As Andrés mentioned, most of these savings are coming from our digital and laser-focused cost control initiatives. These include reduced maintenance and lower fixed costs and G&A.
Turning to Slide 29. As a result, we are reducing the midpoint of our guidance by 5% or $0.07 with a new range of $1.32 to $1.42. On the parent free cash flow side, we are not seeing an impact versus our previously communicated goal of $725 million to $775 million as a result of the strength and diversification of our portfolio. We are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate through 2022. Although it is disappointing to revise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, the limited impact we are seeing in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis illustrates the current strength of our portfolio and balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call.
The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our portfolio of largely long-term contracted generation is resilient in the current pandemic and related economic downturn. Therefore, we remain on track to achieve our strategic goals of greening our portfolio, leading in new technologies and attaining a second investment-grade rating. We have already taken steps this year to strengthen our liquidity and further reduce costs to mitigate the impacts on earnings from decreases in our sales. Although we expect a 5% reduction in this year's earnings, we are reaffirming our 2020 parent free cash flow; and longer-term growth rates in earnings, cash and dividends. We expect to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash through 2022, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit returns to our shareholders.
And finally, I would like to thank the people of AES, who through their discipline and hard work are ensuring safe, reliable and affordable energy in all of the markets we serve.

So that's our assumption. So that really would -- is consistent with a U-shaped recovery or even a W-shaped recovery. If things are more severe, we are in a resilient case. And of course, we have more latitude on different levers that we can pull. I would add that because what we did very early on was increase our liquidity, we have about $0.02 of having that additional liquidity on hand. But I think that was the right thing to do given that there was a lot of uncertainty. So the -- in terms of -- we have a very good track record of cost controls and reductions. And I think that, again, we will react given to how we see the situation evolving. Now we did mention $0.05 additional this year, mostly from our digital initiatives. And I think that we have learned how to work remotely. And there are more digital tools that we can implement, and we expect to -- these savings will continue into next year. So we have some continued additional upside because that's really not in next year's numbers."

So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries. So there's a number of things. First, in general, they were quite quick to lock down. Brazil was an exception to that, and Mexico, but in most countries the lockdown was quite severe and quite early. Second, they will be lifting these restrictions. But in general, the pandemic has been less severe in those countries than it has in the developed world. What we do know about the pandemic is that the, quite frankly, biggest drivers are age. And the second is obesity rates. So when you think of age, a lot of these countries have an average age of 30, which is very different from an average age of almost 50 in some of the developed countries. So the pandemic will have a different effect there. So I'd say the main difference is how much fiscal stimulus can they apply to react to that. So what we're seeing is, again, it varies by country, but some of the smaller countries have had pretty aggressive fiscal stimulus. And they have gone out and basically assured the liquidity. Countries like Panama, for example, have assured the liquidity on hand. And then Gustavo also mentioned that we have worked with the -- even though we're not -- in most cases not directly affected because it's more at the distribution company level, but we've also been working with multilateral institutions to have windows to discount accounts receivable. But the vast bulk of our clients are multinationals, investment-grade multinationals, in these countries.
So taking the specific case of Brazil. I mean, as of yet, we have -- it's in the -- one of those countries in the range that Gustavo talked about between sort of 5% to 15% of our key countries. In Brazil, it's different very much state to state. Brazil is one of the countries where we don't have the long-term contracts. They tend to be shorter-term contracts. So there has been some effect there in Brazil, and it's also the -- one of the ones that we have in local currency. Brazil's obviously one that's been affected. What is our feeling about it? I think, again, in general, these countries will open up. The effects of the pandemic will be somewhat different because of the demographics of it. Personally, I think that one of the things to watch is commodity prices because that will maybe even have a bigger effect than some of the shutdowns given the large informal sectors these countries have. You mentioned Argentina. Argentina is doing very well on the shutdown in terms of its few cases, very controlled cases. And I would say that the main thing to watch in Argentina is debt refinancing -- or debt restructuring, let's say, that they're undergoing now. You will notice that our parent free cash flow is unchanged, but we have a decrease in earnings. One of the -- that's reflecting in part Argentina, where you've had significant devaluations. And you've had some degradation of our tariffs. And -- but we weren't expecting to get any dividends out of it. One of the other businesses affected was DP&L, for example, where we don't expect any dividends. So that's I just wanted to explain why our cash remains unchanged and we're seeing a decrease in dividends. So regarding Latin America, in general, I'm pleased by the reaction of a lot of countries. The populations have been very supportive of their governments in that respect. And given the different demographics, it will evolve differently. So I do expect them to start opening up. It depends on the country, but later on this month and certainly by June and the -- again, the reaction of a younger population will be different."

Today, I will discuss the current state of our business and our strategic goals going forward. We are well positioned to withstand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and are seeing the benefits of our multiyear effort to enhance the resilience of our business. The vast majority of our earnings come from long-term contracted generation, which provides significant protection from the downturn in electricity demand and prices. Furthermore, our liquidity position is strong. We have no major near-term debt amortizations, and we continue to improve our investment-grade metrics. Our construction projects are progressing on schedule without any supply chain disruptions, and we are on track to grow our renewables backlog and achieve our environmental goals. The net effect of all this is that despite seeing double-digit reductions in demand in some of our markets, we are lowering our earnings guidance for the year by only 5% to a range of $1.32 to $1.42. We are reaffirming our expectations for 2020 parent free cash flow and our longer-term growth projections for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. Gustavo will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, our liquidity and our guidance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 4. Today, I will focus my discussion on the 3 core themes of resilience, sustainable growth and leadership in innovation.
Beginning on Slide 5 with the resilience. These are certainly unprecedented times with a global pandemic and a sharp economic downturn resulting from restrictions on travel, mobility and work. Fortunately, for AES, as you may recall from our last quarterly call, we were closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and taking steps to reduce its impact on our business. We began to implement our plans for all nonessential personnel to work remotely by the first week of March, increased our stocks of fuel and PPE at our plants and work sites and built up cash liquidity at all levels of our portfolio. We also ensured that national and local governments recognized the critical importance of the service we provide and classified our operations as essential, facilitating the movement of personnel for our generation plants, utilities and construction sites. As a result of all of these early actions, we have continued to deliver our services without any significant impact and have minimized contagion among our people and contractors. To date, only 10 AES people out of a population of 9,000 have tested positive for the virus. And more importantly, none have become seriously ill or hospitalized. Of these, 5 have been deemed recovered and virus free.
Turning to Slide 6. Our resilience comes not just from our actions to address the crisis but from our fundamental business model. Across our portfolio, we have an average remaining contract life of 14 years. Approximately 70% of our business is long-term contracted generation, with the vast majority in U.S. dollars or euros. Nearly all of our offtakers are investment grade, and our contracts are primarily for capacity, with our revenue relatively unaffected by the actual energy produced. Thus, this part of our business is very resilient to a downturn in energy prices and demand. We have an additional 15% of our business which is generation with shorter-term contracts, which has some modest exposure to spot prices. The remaining 15% of our business is regulated utilities, principally in the U.S., and this is where we have been most impacted by the decrease in demand.
We saw a net reduction of around 10% in April, mainly from commercial and industrial customers, and we expect lower demand to continue for several months before recovering by early next year. We are taking measures to offset the reduction in 2020 earnings, primarily through cost savings that we are realizing from our digital initiatives. For example, investments we have made over the past few years have made it possible for much of our staff to work remotely, including many positions on the operational side. We expect some degree of remote work and the associated benefits to continue even in a post-pandemic world. Through these and other initiatives, we expect to deliver additional cost savings of around $50 million this year, which Gustavo will cover in more detail.
Now let me turn to Slide 7 and our second theme, sustainable growth, which continues to be a key area of focus. Despite the current crisis, we remain on track with our current growth projections and ambitions to triple our renewables portfolio by 2024 versus 2016. Our backlog is now 5.3 gigawatts, of which 1.8 gigawatts are currently under construction. Turning to Slide 8: Construction includes the 531-megawatt hydro at Alto Maipo in Chile, which continues to progress according to our prior schedule. Phase 1 is now more than 93% complete. The turbines are in place and only 2.7 miles of tunneling out of a total 46 remains to complete Phase 1 and start operations early next year. Of our more than 30 renewable projects under construction, only 2 small ones have been affected to date by the COVID-19 lockdown. Both are in upstate New York, where we had to temporarily stop work. Fortunately, as you may recall from our fourth quarter call, we took very early steps to ensure we had solar PV panels and our balance of plants in country and at our construction sites as we foresaw potential supply chain bottlenecks in China and Korea.
Turning to Slide 9. I am pleased to announce the start of commissioning of the world's most efficient solar project, Andes solar in Chile, which at 37% has the world's highest capacity factor as a result of using bifacial PV panels and a high solar irradiation, combined with the low temperatures of the Atacama Desert.
Building on our innovation in solar, we are bringing a new prefabricated PV design to our projects, starting with an initial 10 megawatts in Chile. We are finalizing a strategic partnership with a company that has a patented design that not only allows for construction to be completed in half the time but can also double the energy output per acre versus today's best-in-class project designs. We expect to expand this solar PV technology to many of our projects in the future to allow for a faster construction, more efficient use of land and new C&I offerings. Regarding new PPAs signed, so far this year, we have added approximately 700 megawatts of new renewable PPAs to our backlog, mostly in Chile and the U.S. Thanks to our leadership in innovation, we continue to see mid-teen levered returns on our renewable projects at the stand-alone project level. We are on track to deliver between 2 and 3 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs this year, and growth in demand for smaller projects in the U.S. remains especially strong. In Chile and Colombia, our Green Blend and Extend strategy has resulted in 2.5 gigawatts of new PPAs and the construction of 1.6 gigawatts of new renewables.
Now on to Slide 10. In addition to wind and solar, our energy storage business also continues to grow rapidly, both through our own projects and through Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens which sells energy storage systems to third parties. Both aspects of our business are benefiting from an acceleration in demand for battery-based systems. Today, about half of our solar bids in the U.S. include an energy storage component. New markets and application also continue to emerge, such as Virginia's 3.1-gigawatt energy storage mandate and Germany's plan to add up to 6 gigawatts to support the transmission network. Even in the midst of the current crisis, in early April, we signed a 15-year PPA for 100 megawatts of 4-hour-duration energy storage in Southern California through sPower. I'm also very proud that we will soon be commissioning the world's first virtual reservoir at the Alfalfal hydro complex just outside Santiago, Chile. This virtual reservoir consists of 10 megawatts of 5-hour batteries, which allow for dispatching the ""run of the river"" hydro largely at night when solar power is not available and energy prices are higher. We will be increasing this virtual reservoir to 250 megawatts over the next couple of years, and there are several smaller virtual reservoir projects in late-stage development in the U.S.
Fluence currently has an all-time high of 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage systems under construction, which include some of the largest projects in the world. This year, we will be rolling out our sixth-generation energy storage technology platform. It is both factory assembled and modular; and will improve reliability, increase the speed of execution and lower costs. Through our growth in renewables and energy storage, we continue to make progress towards our ambitious environmental goals. As you can see on Slide 11, we remain committed to reducing our coal generation to less than 30% of our gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which will make us compliant with ESG standards set by Norges Bank, among other institutions. We expect to realize this target through the continued sale and decommissioning of coal plants, along with the execution of our extensive backlog of renewable projects.
Finally, turning to our leadership in innovation on Slide 12. We continue to move forward on a number of innovative solutions that we see as highly relevant for the long-term future of the industry. One example is Uplight, which, as a reminder, works with more than 80 electric and gas utilities in the U.S. reaching more than 100 million households and businesses, providing a suite of digital solutions. We expect revenue growth of 30% this year fueled in part by utilities' desire to improve customers' experiences in a capital-efficient digital way. Another example of our innovation is our partnership with Google, which is progressing well. We continue to make headway on a number of initiatives that we will be in a position to announce in the near future.
Now I would like to pass the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I will cover our financial results, credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022.
In the first quarter, we made good progress on our key financial metrics. As shown on Slide 14, adjusted EPS was $0.29 versus $0.28 in Q1 2019, in line with our expectations. We benefited from higher contributions from the MCAC SBU, largely due to improved availability and hydrology in Panama as well as lower effective tax rate. These positive drivers were partially offset by the reversion to prior rates at DPL in Ohio and mild weather at our regulated utilities in the U.S.
Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $250 million for the quarter, a decrease of $22 million versus the first quarter of 2019.
I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as mild weather at both DPL and IPL. These impacts were partially offset by contributions from new renewable projects. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by lower interest expense and realized FX gains in Chile, partially offset by a planned major outage at our hydro plant in Colombia as part of a larger project to extend its useful life. Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects the return to operations at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage in 2019, as well as improved availability at our Colon plant. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama following a very dry year in 2019.
Finally, in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the United Kingdom.
Before moving on, I want to provide an update on DP&L in Ohio on Slide 20. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, after reverting to previous ESP 1 rates, DP&L was required to pass certain regulatory tests, including the significantly excessive earnings test or SEET. In April, DP&L began this process by filing an application with the commission. There is a comment period set for July and potential hearing, if needed, set for October. A final ruling is expected by early 2021. We feel good about our ability to pass this test and maintain ESP 1 rates. As we have said in the past, AES continues to be fully committed to DP&L. We are now planning to invest approximately $900 million in its grid over the next 4 years, including base distribution, transmission and smart grid investments, which will lead to low double-digit rate base growth through 2023. To that end, AES plans to invest $300 million of new equity in DP&L, half of it this year and the other half in 2021. These investments will allow DP&L to continue to provide safe and reliable service while materially improving the experience we deliver to our customers and preserving very competitive rates.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 21. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, between 2011 and 2019, we reduced our parent debt by $3.1 billion, which is about 50%. At year-end, our parent leverage was 3.7x and our FFO-to-debt was 21%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. Currently, we have $800 million of borrowings under the revolver, roughly half of which was drawn as precautionary measure to reinforce our cash position. We expect to end the year with a 0 revolver balance and credit metrics that are even stronger than in 2019. We are also maintaining our regular dialogue with the rating agencies and continue to be on track to receive our second investment-grade rating. While the fundamental credit strength of AES remains unchanged, given the current macro environment, we believe the timing of this upgrade is now more likely to be closer to year-end.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 22. In times of uncertainty, we recognize that cash is king. To that end, we are in the strongest financial position of our history. We have $3.3 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. This is more than sufficient to meet any unforeseen needs over the remainder of the year.
Turning to our receivables on Slide 23, which have remained stable over the last few years. We have been monitoring our receivables very closely to ensure they are within the 45- to 60-day grace period allowed under our contracts. And so far, through April, they are in-line. It is worthwhile to mention that in a few of our markets, governments have declared a payment moratorium for certain residential utility clients as the lockdown was in place. While we are mostly removed from this impact as a generator, this could create some additional working capital needs at certain businesses. To that end, we are working with multilateral organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank to create mechanisms for securitizing receivables in these markets.
Now turning to our refinancing needs in 2020 on Slide 24. As you may know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. In fact, just last year, we executed more than $5 billion in liability management across our portfolio. As a result, we have only $300 million of debt to be refinanced for the remainder of the year, most of which is at our U.S. utilities. We are pleased to see investor interest in the $407 million IPALCO refinanced we recently completed, with the deal being 5x oversubscribed, reducing our refinancing needs to just over $300 million for the remainder of the year.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 25, beginning on the left-hand side. Sources reflect $1.4 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $381 million to shareholders this year. We do not plan any additional debt reduction beyond repayment of the temporary drawings on our revolver, which was $180 million at the end of 2019. Our credit metrics are strong and will continue to improve on the strength of our cash flow alone. And we plan to invest $565 million in our subsidiaries, including our equity for the Southland repowering, our renewables backlog and the $150 million investment in grid modernization at DPL this year. These leave us with up to $452 million to be allocated. The amount is largely a function of the asset sales we plan to close this year. The use of this cash may include investment in AES Gener's Green Blend and Extend strategy, as we discussed on our last call. The timing of this investment is dependent on AES Gener's funding needs, so it may be later this year or early next year.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 26. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 27. Roughly 1/3 of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener I just discussed. This $1.9 billion also includes the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L, which is incremental to our last call. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
Finally, turning to our guidance and the impact of COVID-19 on Slide 28. As Andrés mentioned, AES is well positioned to weather this storm due to the actions we have taken over the last several years to improve the resilience of our portfolio.
So let me start first with the impact from commodities and FX. Despite significant volatility in both markets, we are expecting an impact of only $0.03. This is because today our business is mostly contracted and denominated in U.S. dollars, materially reducing our exposure. We are also forecasting a $0.02 impact due to a higher interest expense as a result of drawing on our revolving credit facilities to reinforce our liquidity. Like many other companies in our sector, we are also seeing an impact on demand, primarily at our regulated utilities, including IPL and DPL, where we do not currently benefit from [ decoupling protection ]. In April, we saw C&I demand decline in the mid-teens at both businesses, with a partial offset of about 6% from an increased residential demand, where we have better margins. Internationally, demand has dropped 5% to 15% in our key markets. But again, in those markets, our model is mostly based on take-or-pay contracts or tolling agreements with limited exposure to demand. The impact from lower demand across our portfolio is expected to be $0.07 in 2020.
Although projecting future loads or GDP recovery is very challenging in these unprecedented times, we are currently assuming demand will have an extended U-shaped recovery with a mid-teens average decline across our portfolio in the second quarter, high single digits in the third quarter and low single digits in the fourth quarter, not returning to precrisis levels until next year. As a reference and assuming our current geographic mix, a 1% change in the [ year-to-go ] demand translates into an approximately $0.01 impact on our full year earnings. We have also been working very hard on potential levers to offset this impact and are expecting an incremental cost savings in the year of about $0.05. As Andrés mentioned, most of these savings are coming from our digital and laser-focused cost control initiatives. These include reduced maintenance and lower fixed costs and G&A.
Turning to Slide 29. As a result, we are reducing the midpoint of our guidance by 5% or $0.07 with a new range of $1.32 to $1.42. On the parent free cash flow side, we are not seeing an impact versus our previously communicated goal of $725 million to $775 million as a result of the strength and diversification of our portfolio. We are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth rate through 2022. Although it is disappointing to revise our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, the limited impact we are seeing in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis illustrates the current strength of our portfolio and balance sheet.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call.
The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our portfolio of largely long-term contracted generation is resilient in the current pandemic and related economic downturn. Therefore, we remain on track to achieve our strategic goals of greening our portfolio, leading in new technologies and attaining a second investment-grade rating. We have already taken steps this year to strengthen our liquidity and further reduce costs to mitigate the impacts on earnings from decreases in our sales. Although we expect a 5% reduction in this year's earnings, we are reaffirming our 2020 parent free cash flow; and longer-term growth rates in earnings, cash and dividends. We expect to generate $3.4 billion of discretionary cash through 2022, which we will invest to continue to deliver double-digit returns to our shareholders.
And finally, I would like to thank the people of AES, who through their discipline and hard work are ensuring safe, reliable and affordable energy in all of the markets we serve.

So that's our assumption. So that really would -- is consistent with a U-shaped recovery or even a W-shaped recovery. If things are more severe, we are in a resilient case. And of course, we have more latitude on different levers that we can pull. I would add that because what we did very early on was increase our liquidity, we have about $0.02 of having that additional liquidity on hand. But I think that was the right thing to do given that there was a lot of uncertainty. So the -- in terms of -- we have a very good track record of cost controls and reductions. And I think that, again, we will react given to how we see the situation evolving. Now we did mention $0.05 additional this year, mostly from our digital initiatives. And I think that we have learned how to work remotely. And there are more digital tools that we can implement, and we expect to -- these savings will continue into next year.

So first, the reaction there will be different, perhaps by country, but it's also somewhat different than the developed countries. So there's a number of things. First, in general, they were quite quick to lock down. Brazil was an exception to that, and Mexico, but in most countries the lockdown was quite severe and quite early. Second, they will be lifting these restrictions. But in general, the pandemic has been less severe in those countries than it has in the developed world. What we do know about the pandemic is that the, quite frankly, biggest drivers are age. And the second is obesity rates. So when you think of age, a lot of these countries have an average age of 30, which is very different from an average age of almost 50 in some of the developed countries. So the pandemic will have a different effect there. So I'd say the main difference is how much fiscal stimulus can they apply to react to that. So what we're seeing is, again, it varies by country, but some of the smaller countries have had pretty aggressive fiscal stimulus. And they have gone out and basically assured the liquidity. Countries like Panama, for example, have assured the liquidity on hand. And then Gustavo also mentioned that we have worked with the -- even though we're not -- in most cases not directly affected because it's more at the distribution company level, but we've also been working with multilateral institutions to have windows to discount accounts receivable. But the vast bulk of our clients are multinationals, investment-grade multinationals, in these countries.
So taking the specific case of Brazil. I mean, as of yet, we have -- it's in the -- one of those countries in the range that Gustavo talked about between sort of 5% to 15% of our key countries. In Brazil, it's different very much state to state. Brazil is one of the countries where we don't have the long-term contracts. They tend to be shorter-term contracts. So there has been some effect there in Brazil, and it's also the -- one of the ones that we have in local currency. Brazil's obviously one that's been affected. What is our feeling about it? I think, again, in general, these countries will open up. The effects of the pandemic will be somewhat different because of the demographics of it. Personally, I think that one of the things to watch is commodity prices because that will maybe even have a bigger effect than some of the shutdowns given the large informal sectors these countries have. You mentioned Argentina. Argentina is doing very well on the shutdown in terms of its few cases, very controlled cases. And I would say that the main thing to watch in Argentina is debt refinancing -- or debt restructuring, let's say, that they're undergoing now. You will notice that our parent free cash flow is unchanged, but we have a decrease in earnings. One of the -- that's reflecting in part Argentina, where you've had significant devaluations. And you've had some degradation of our tariffs. And -- but we weren't expecting to get any dividends out of it. One of the other businesses affected was DP&L, for example, where we don't expect any dividends. So that's I just wanted to explain why our cash remains unchanged and we're seeing a decrease in dividends. So regarding Latin America, in general, I'm pleased by the reaction of a lot of countries. The populations have been very supportive of their governments in that respect. And given the different demographics, it will evolve differently. So I do expect them to start opening up. It depends on the country, but later on this month and certainly by June and the -- again, the reaction of a younger population will be different."

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near-term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We",1405,"Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near-term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer-term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge. 
Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million. 
At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year. 
Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation. To comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by 11 percentage points to 34%. 
We're working on a couple of additional transactions that, combined with our growth in renewables, will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank's criteria by next year. 
To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy. 
Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise. 
In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections. 
Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tiete, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan to upgrade AES Tiete's listing to Novo Mercado on the BOVESPA, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tiete for the benefit of all of its shareholders. 
We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital allocations to our customers. 
This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years. 
As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours. 
As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera Hydro Complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component. 
Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban or congested areas. 
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million households and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020. 
Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these run. 
In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market. 
Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan. Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are",1460,"Thanks, Andres. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan. Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. 
As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02. 
Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of as a result 
[Audio Gap] 
As you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on Slide '18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels. 
Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across the markets. This assumes the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. 
The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our U.S. utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. 
Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume a standard U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment. 
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities I just discussed and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL in Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives. 
Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our 4 slides beginning on Slide 22. 
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our La Colda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile. 
Higher PTC at our MC SBU view reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama, following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom. 
Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions from new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online. 
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment-grade threshold of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give investment-grade rating later this year. 
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses. 
Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year. 
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities. 
Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize it. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our [ contributing one ]. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in 2020. 
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from an asset sale proceeds. 
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAS, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in the P&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. 
In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So by buying BNDS' shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tiete on the Novo Mercado. At the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10% to 20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listings. 
So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend uplift. And then you have normal ordinary cars, which have votes. So our shares and BNDS' shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So it's 1 share 1 vote. We still control this company. 
I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there Tiete actually is a good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money point of view because we think it's accretive.

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications.

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant, long distance transmission expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. 
So I think this is an area that's going to grow very quickly. So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you know, our award-winning project out in Kauai. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want 24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component. 
Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for all batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to -- in some cases, a chemical, back to electric. And the losses are very low. 
There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and that has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that batteries seem to be the killer app. 
Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolás plant. 
So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there's -- some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction. Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity, again, you're talking about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage. 
Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation."

So if you actually see why we guided down initially. We correctly forecasted that we would have a drop in demand with the quarantines at our utilities and our distribution businesses. So that's what's going on. But other than that, our plants are critical. So in those cases, where we're selling to the grid or selling to, which is, in many cases, backed by the government, we are make sure that we get paid because we're absolutely critical to the grid or the low-cost generator in that market.

So as you become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade, but you get those additional investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables. 
But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help you help quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt."

So you have to convince somebody, a third-party, that you're going to operate this and they think it's a good project as well. 
So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel. Gener has debt, for example, Tiete has debt, which would get some of those advantages. But we think that the discipline of having to project finance is good and having to bring in partners is good.

So again, we have 12 years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had. 
Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on one hand, all those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call.

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million.
At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by a 11 percentage points to 34%. We're working on a couple of additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank's criteria by next year.
To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise.
In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections.
Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tietê, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan to upgrade AES Tietê's listing to Novo Mercado on the Bovespa, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tietê for the benefit of all of its shareholders.
We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our customers.
This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025.
Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years.
As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours.
As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component.
Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban or congested areas.
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives.
Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million household and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020.
Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these firm up.
In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market.
Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are",1527,"Thanks, Andrés. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings.
As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02.
Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take-or-pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We intentionally work with high-quality off-takers, and this strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our business model.
For example, as you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on Slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. This assumed the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our US and Utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities, I just discussed, and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL and Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives.
Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 22.
In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile.
Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama, following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom.
Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions for new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter, and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give us confidence in attaining our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses.
Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities.
Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize the value of some of its store in agreements. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in 2020.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We're also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So by buying BNDES' shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tietê on the Novo Mercado. In the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10%,  20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listings.
So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend uplift. And then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDES' shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So it's 1 share 1 vote, we still control this company.
I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there the Tietê actually is a good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money point of view because we're buying it accretive. We are -- it's accretive at these prices. Second, I would say that it's a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity, the carbon intensity of our footprint."

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long distance transmission expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. So I think this is an area that's going to grow very quickly.
So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you know, our award-winning project out in Kiewit. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want 24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component.
Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for -- our batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to -- in some cases, a chemical back to electric. And the losses are very low.
There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and then it has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that batteries seem to be the killer app.
Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant.
So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction. Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you're talking about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage. 
Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation."

So look, we've talked probably, I'd say around 2 years for it to turn positive in terms of EPS. And what basically happens is that the faster it grows, the more new products you have to come out with, you delay that, turning it positive. So it's a business that could be positive today if that were the objective. But the objective is to create value.  So we think a sell it down, as you say, will give us a marker.

So as you become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade by Fitch, but you get those additional investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables. 
But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help yourselves quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt."

So you have to convince somebody, a third-party, that you're going to operate this and that they think it's a good project as well.
So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel.

The issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that were produced in some factories. So we've operated for 12 years. This is the first, let's say, serious incident we've had. But really, the best standards are, for example, UL 9045a. And if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth generation incorporates all these.
So if you look at, for example, it doesn't require -- it's not contained, so it's actually outside. The modules are separated, so you don't have cotangents. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it's not enclosed, the heat and any gases would rise. So definitely, we feel that we've taken all the lessons learned from this event. We've incorporated into the new design. And really, safety was one of our #1 priority. So again, we have 12 years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had.
Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on them with one hand, all those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.
So yes, we -- as you know, safety is #1 value, super important for us.

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million.
At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by a 11 percentage points to 34%. We're working on a couple of additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank's criteria by next year.
To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise.
In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections.
Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tietê, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan to upgrade AES Tietê's listing to Novo Mercado on the Bovespa, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tietê for the benefit of all of its shareholders.
We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our customers.
This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025.
Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years.
As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours.
As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component.
Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban or congested areas.
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives.
Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million household and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020.
Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these firm up.
In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market.
Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are",1527,"Thanks, Andrés. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings.
As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02.
Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take-or-pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We intentionally work with high-quality off-takers, and this strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our business model.
For example, as you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on Slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. This assumed the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our US and Utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities, I just discussed, and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL and Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives.
Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 22.
In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile.
Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama, following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom.
Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions for new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter, and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give us confidence in attaining our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses.
Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities.
Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize the value of some of its store in agreements. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in 2020.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We're also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

If you think of the sale of Sul, the sale of Eletropaulo, you think of the sale of our telecom Atimus. So what we're doing here is we're -- BNDES wanted to sell part of its share. So by buying BNDES' shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tietê on the Novo Mercado. In the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10%,  20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listings.
So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend uplift. And then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDES' shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So it's 1 share 1 vote, we still control this company.
I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there the Tietê actually is a good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money point of view because we're buying it accretive. We are -- it's accretive at these prices. Second, I would say that it's a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity, the carbon intensity of our footprint."

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long distance transmission expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. So I think this is an area that's going to grow very quickly.
So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you know, our award-winning project out in Kiewit. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want 24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component.
Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for -- our batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to -- in some cases, a chemical back to electric. And the losses are very low.
There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and then it has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that batteries seem to be the killer app.
Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant.
So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction. Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you're talking about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage. 
Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation."

So if you actually see why we guided down initially. We correctly forecasted that we would have a drop in demand with the quarantine at our utilities, at our distribution businesses. So that's what's going on. But other than that, our plants are critical. So in those cases, where we're selling to the grid or selling to, which is, in many cases, backed by the government, we are -- make sure that we get paid because we're absolutely critical to the grid or the low-cost generator in that market.

But we feel very good about the business. And as I said, I think that this is a market, which is growing very rapidly. Now something that people haven't talked about, I think, so much is, if you do have a change in federal policies in the U.S. to promote green or carbon-free generation, we're very well positioned. Fluence is very well positioned. But specifically, AES because we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of potential projects in the U.S. And those run the range from quite advance to medium advance.
If we looked at just hypothetical projects, it's a much bigger number. So we feel good that we have a pipeline that we could execute on and potentially double our rate of growth of renewable build in the U.S. should there be such a change."

So look, we've talked probably, I'd say around 2 years for it to turn positive in terms of EPS. And what basically happens is that the faster it grows, the more new products you have to come out with, you delay that, turning it positive. So it's a business that could be positive today if that were the objective. But the objective is to create value.  So we think a sell it down, as you say, will give us a marker.

So as you become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade by Fitch, but you get those additional investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables. 
But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help yourselves quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt."

So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel.

The issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that were produced in some factories. So we've operated for 12 years. This is the first, let's say, serious incident we've had. But really, the best standards are, for example, UL 9045a. And if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth generation incorporates all these.
So if you look at, for example, it doesn't require -- it's not contained, so it's actually outside. The modules are separated, so you don't have cotangents. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it's not enclosed, the heat and any gases would rise. So definitely, we feel that we've taken all the lessons learned from this event. We've incorporated into the new design. And really, safety was one of our #1 priority. So again, we have 12 years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had.
Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on them with one hand, all those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.
So yes, we -- as you know, safety is #1 value, super important for us.

On our last call, I outlined 3 top priorities: firs",1960,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call. Today, I will cover both our near-term priorities and the progress we have made on our larger strategic goals. 
On our last call, I outlined 3 top priorities: first, achieving our 2020 guidance; second, attaining a second investment-grade rating; and third, decarbonizing our portfolio. We see all 3 of these goals, both individually and collectively, as catalysts for attracting a wider investor base. Perhaps more importantly, we see all 3 as clear demonstrations of our ability to thrive in today's evolving landscape. 
Today, I am pleased to report that we're making great progress on all of these objectives and have several exciting developments to discuss. First, as Gustavo will review in his remarks, our portfolio continues to prove its resiliency in the face of COVID-19, and we're on track to achieve our full year guidance. In fact, we expect to be at the top end of the ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. 
Turning to our goal of attaining a second investment-grade rating. I'm proud to say that we were upgraded by S&P earlier this week. This reflects the low level of risk inherent in our current business model. Two investment-grade ratings will help us reduce our overall cost of capital and enable us to attract a broader investor base. Following this milestone, we remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and increasing the percentage of our business in the U.S. 
Now to our third priority of aggressive decarbonization on Slide 4. As you may recall, we set a near-term target to reduce our coal generation to below 30% of total generation by the end of this year and to below 10% by 2030. I'm happy to report that with today's announced retirement of an additional 1.2 gigawatts, we have reduced our coal generation to 29% on a pro forma basis. 3/4 of these retirements are in the U.S. and the remainder are in Chile. Importantly, these retirements were already anticipated in our guidance, and we will achieve our decarbonization targets while delivering on our financial commitments. 
We see the transformation of our portfolio as an ongoing process, and we expect to announce additional coal retirements and asset sales in the near term. However, this milestone is significant in that it puts us in compliance with the environmental criteria of several large investors, including Norges Bank. In the longer term, we expect to produce net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. 
Moving to our long-term strategy and the progress we've made to date. As we have discussed previously, our strategy revolves around 3 core themes: one, investing in sustainable growth, two, offering innovative solutions; and three, delivering superior results.
Turning to Slide 5. We are well positioned to meet our strategic and financial objectives. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 2.1 gigawatts of wind, solar and energy storage projects, which is the most we have signed in the first 3 quarters of any given year. 
On to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts, which is also the largest in our history. Approximately 1/3 is under construction, with the majority expected to come online through 2022. Almost half of this backlog is in the U.S., which we expect to grow as a proportion of our business going forward. Our backlog includes a mix of solar, wind, energy storage and our Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile. We continue to make good progress at Alto Maipo, where construction is more than 96% complete. 
As you can see on Slide 7, renewables are now nearly 40% of our installed capacity. And this proportion will grow materially as we complete the 6.8 gigawatts in our 100% renewable backlog and sell and retire additional coal plants. 
In addition to our renewables backlog, we see significant growth opportunities at our 2 U.S. utilities. DP&L and IP&L. We are pleased with the recent developments at IP&L, where we reached a constructive settlement on various pending regulatory proceedings. Gustavo will provide additional details shortly, but this settlement is truly a milestone for DP&L and it grows its rate base and its network.
Turning to Slide 8. I have previously discussed that our Green Blend and Extend, strategy, where we work with existing customers to convert the power sold from thermal to renewable generation while extending the contract life. This approach allows all parties to meet their financial and environmental objectives. Since our last call, we signed an additional 410 megawatts of solar capacity under a 17-year contract in Chile, bringing our total Green Blend and Extend, execution to more than 2 gigawatts. 
As a demonstration of the strength of our existing coal contracts, in August AES had handed reached an agreement with BHP for early termination, resulting in a payment of $720 million, which we will use in part to fund our renewables growth in Chile. 
While we only report on our projects with signed PPAS, as you can see on Slide 9, we have a robust development pipeline, which we believe is one of our key differentiators. We currently have a development pipeline of 25 gigawatts in key markets, of which 12 gigawatts are in the U.S. Over the past couple of months, we have been solidifying our pipeline by securing land and interconnection rights. We already have very capable solar and energy storage development teams, and we recently acquired a group of experienced wind developers. 
Expected renewables growth in the U.S. is currently 20 gigawatts per year. However, this rate could accelerate. We are very well positioned to take advantage of any increase in the rate of growth in demand for renewables. Furthermore, we also could benefit from an extension of ITC and PTC incentives for renewables as well as the potential for new incentives for stand-alone storage.
Turning to Slide 10 and our LNG strategy. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business in 3 markets: the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace coal and higher-cost fuel oils. 
As you may know, we're developing an efficient 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas facility and a 450 tera BTU LNG terminal in Vietnam. We have hit key milestones towards closing these projects, which will help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing electricity demand. Last week, we signed a term sheet for the LNG terminal in partnership with PV Gas, the state-owned gas utility. In parallel, we have seen strong interest from potential lenders to finance the majority of the capital costs. 
In Central America and the Caribbean, we continue to lead the transition to cleaner natural gas. We currently have a total of 150 tera BTus of LNG storage capacity, and an additional 50 tera BTUs is under construction in the Dominican Republic. We now have contracted 60% of this storage capacity, and we're in advanced discussions for an additional 20%. This would bring our total contracted volume to 80% in 2023 and beyond. For context, 200 tera BTU LNG volume can serve approximately 3 gigawatts of natural gas generation.
Moving on Slide 11. The second component of our strategy is offering innovative solutions. We see the energy needs of our clients, like Google, evolving to achieve the highest standards in clean energy. We are leading the transition through our unique integration of renewables with our scalable platforms of Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Our technological innovation gives us a key competitive advantage. An example is energy storage, where we have access to the latest technology in the sector and combine it with our unique industry insights to create transformative clean energy solutions. 
As a reminder, working closely with our customer, Kiuc in Hawaii, we were the first company to develop a true 24/7 solar and energy storage project, and we continue to advance new applications. In fact, we recently inaugurated the world's first virtual reservoir in Chile, which combines run of the river hydro with battery-based energy storage, allowing us to sell our energy when prices are highest.
Turning to Slide 12. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to maintain its position as the market leader in the sector. This year, Fluence has been awarded 690 megawatts of contracts, increasing their awarded or delivered capacity to 2.4 gigawatts. Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million this year, an increase of 400% compared to last year. 
While rapidly growing their backlog, Fluence continues to enhance their digital capabilities and to complement their suite of solutions. To that end, Fluence acquired AMS, the leading provider of AI-enabled bidding software for storage and generation assets. Through the AMS acquisition, Fluence now has ongoing contracts for digital bidding services for more than 2.4 gigawatts, and most of it additional to Fluence's fleet. The integration of this technology to Fluence's current offerings will help optimize the use of energy storage and to ensure the greatest value for their clients. 
We're also looking to additional new products and innovation that could transform the sector, as shown on Slide 13. With our recent investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become a great differentiator as solar penetration increases, especially near urban and congested areas. 
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our own development pipeline. We aim to be the most competitive solar operator and developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density in combination with our ongoing robotic and digital initiatives. 
One example of how we are integrating all of these technologies to improve customer outcomes is the Andes IIb project in Chile. This project consists of 180 megawatts of solar incorporates 10 megawatts of 5B's technology and includes 560 megawatt hours of energy storage, the largest in Latin America. 
Another example of our leading innovations is our Uplight platform, which is helping utilities improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. Both of these capabilities are increasingly relevant to Uplight's 100 million end users and 80 utility customers in the U.S. 
Finally, as I previously discussed, we continue to be on the forefront of new technologies. To that end, we have been running tests on hydrogen at several thermal plants in Latin America. We consider ourselves to be well positioned to be a leader to incorporate green hydrogen if and when it becomes economic sometime in the future.
Turning now to the third component of our strategy, which Gustavo will spend more time on: delivering superior results. By investing in our development pipeline, we are earning attractive risk-adjusted returns. As you can see on Slide 14, in the U.S  we're earning low double-digit returns, while internationally we're earning mid- to high-teen returns. 
Before concluding, I would like to note that last week, we launched a new brand with a new logo, as you can see on our slides. We have transformed AES into a leader in clean energy, and our new brand symbolizes our position at the forefront of the technological and commercial changes that are redefining our industry. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."
35312,690896121,2132883,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2020",2020-11-06,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan. Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade,",1351,"Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan. 
Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade, we have proactively transformed our portfolio. And now 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years, supported by creditworthy offtakers. At the same time, more than 80% of our earnings are now in dollars. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow.
Turning to Slide 16. You can see how our portfolio has performed during these challenging times. As you know, a majority of our customers are large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. As a result, Q3 receivables and days sales outstanding remained stable and very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to Slide 17. The impact of the global lockdown on our financial results has been mostly limited to our utilities. Our generation businesses have been largely unaffected due to the take-or-pay nature of contracts and customers being deemed essential. As you may recall, in our first quarter call we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. Since then, demand performance has been better than our expectation. 
For Q3, our initial projection was for a demand drop of about 5% to 7% at our U.S. utilities. While the actual result was significantly less severe than anticipated, on a weather-normalized basis, the net combined volume at DPL and IPL is mostly flat. Demand at DPL was up 3% and largely driven by the higher load from residential customers, while demand at IPL was down 3% as the load from commercial and industrial customers has yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, the total net impact of the lower demand on our utilities was only $0.01 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.02 to $0.03.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 18. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter versus $0.48 last year. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.11 impact most related to last year's insurance recovery and outage that occurred this quarter at one of our facilities in Dominican Republic, which is already back in operations. Results also reflect the regulatory changes that were implemented at DP&L and in Argentina in Q4 2019. These headwinds were partially offset by higher contributions from the Southland repowering project, our Eurasia SBU, our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives as well as a lower tax rate. 
Turning to Slide 19. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $331 million for the quarter, a decrease of $95 million versus the third quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 20 
In the U.S. and utilities SBU, PTC remained relatively flat. The benefit from the commencement of PPAs at Southland Energy CCGTs was mostly offset by the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL in 2019 as well as lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. 
Before moving on, I would like to take a moment to update you on recent regulatory developments at DP&L on Slide 21. I'm very pleased to announce that we have reached a successful settlement with PUCO staff and key intervenors, resolving 4 open proceedings, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty and allowing us to move forward with our smart grid investments. More specifically as a result of this settlement, DP&L committed to file a new ESP by October 1, 2023, and will continue to recover its approximately $80 million annual rate stabilization charge until the new ESP becomes effective. DP&L will make smart grid investments of $249 million over the next 4 years, to earn a return through the investment infrastructure rider. Resolution was reached on the 2 pending retroactive SEET tests related to 2018 and 2019. And DP&L passed the SEET and MFA regulatory tests filed earlier this year. 
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 22. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by dry hydrology at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, resulting in lower generation and high energy purchases. Lower PTC at our [MCAC] SBU primarily reflects the outage-related impacts I discussed previously as well as the arbitration settlement at Changuinola this year. 
Finally, [in the region], higher results reflect lower maintenance and outages as well as lower interest expense due to debt repayment in 2020. It also includes a favorable variance in India given the OPGC COD delay last year. 
Now to Slide 25. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.96 versus $1.02 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. In fact, based on our strong year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now expecting to be at the top end of this range.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 26. As we have discussed on our prior calls, since 2011 we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. As Andrés mentioned, we recently received our second investment-grade rating. We are very pleased that S&P has recognized the underlying quality and strength of our portfolio. As you can see on this slide, we have improved our ratings by 2 to 3 notches over the last 4 years. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we'll continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels. 
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. We expect [to have] $1.5 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is roughly $100 million higher than our prior disclosure. 
Regarding asset sales, today we are very pleased to announce a sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland repowering projects for $424 million to Yulico, expanding from our successful partnership at SPower. This transaction demonstrates the substantial intrinsic value of our portfolio and how we benefit from our platform and long-term contracted assets. As you may recall, Southland has a 20-year contract and was commissioned early this year. This sell-down implies a total equity value of more than $1.2 billion. 
With this transaction, combined with our previously announced asset sales, we have exceeded our proceeds target for the year by approximately $100 million for a total of $650 million. Further, based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now also expect parent free cash flow to come in at the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million.
Moving to the right-hand side, uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter, except the investments in our subsidiaries, which are roughly $200 million higher. The increase primarily reflects a temporary cash injection at Southland and [higher] investments in renewables. Approximately 90% of the $900 million of investments in subsidiaries are in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022 beginning on Slide 28. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million come from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 29. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to any review by the Board, we continue to expect it to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. 
We also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project, and the investment in Gener. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So this is sort of an add-on, and we're retiring some of the thermal assets. So it's a transition. 
So it's going to be growing over time. We feel very good about the way it's sort of blending in. Something like Green Blend and Extend it's blending in to this growth. 
So we have a backlog of 7 gigawatts. It's a good mix of U.S. and outside, and it has good returns. And there's a variety of regulatory schemes under which they operate. 
So we feel good about it. It's going to be growing, and it's going to -- it's replacing some of the older thermal assets that we're retiring. 
Second part of your question regarding Fluence, well realize that as I've said in the past, the faster Fluence grows, to some extent it pushes off a little bit positive earnings. We're creating an enormous amount of value. But all R&D for example or all upgrading of our teams around the world, that's expensed. 
So when you're growing 400% this year, we expect a 40-plus growth rate going forward. We have a backlog of 1 gigawatt. So that's still [ up. ] 
So there's no -- right now, Fluence is a drag of around $0.02. So it will -- everything has a positive margin. We expect this to turn around, but it's a little bit of a function of how fast we grow. So ironically the more value we create and the faster we grow, that may take a little bit more time."

And I think to your question on renewables, probably the best way to think about it is most of our free cash is going to renewables nowadays. So it's about $350 million to $400 million of investment in new renewables going forward. And you put low double-digit to mid-teen returns, and you see that this is going to be an important driver of earnings going forward."

So really what we see is that there is a true competitive advantage of combining our existing platforms with the new. And I say that because it's easy to talk about renewables, but really that's just energy. And what the market is demanding is capacity. So you're going to get that capacity in the short term from your existing traditional facilities and then with energy storage. 
So thinking about that, nobody is in a better position than us to do that because we really are the leader in the -- not only the amount of energy storage, but more important, I think the new applications, finding new ways to use this. So I feel very good about this sort of leading this transition in a very responsible way retiring our coal plants, selling coal plants, providing that capacity to some extent in other new markets in -- with gas. Because quite frankly not all markets are capable with today's technology of efficiently providing capacity. Even with batteries, it would be too expensive with renewables. 
So we're leading that transition to a lower-carbon future. But at the same time, I think we're uniquely integrating, be it energy storage, innovative renewables. I mean I think 5B, that technology will play a greater role in the future as you get greater really penetration of solar in some areas. And so being able to do it in a smaller space is very valuable. Being able to do it faster is very valuable. 
We're really doing some very interesting things on robotics. We're doing some very interesting things in digital, digital controls. And so Uplight is one aspect of it. But so is for example, the purchase of AMS by Fluent. 
So that's a little bit how I see it. So while it's true that there is a premium today for pure renewable plays, we think there'll be a premium tomorrow for those companies that truly satisfy what customers need. So it's not only energy. It's energy plus capacity. And we will lead the way into providing capacity, energy and customer-facing solutions into the future. So it's a very interesting transition, even though it's a little bit complicated story."

We will, we believe, making announcements into the future in terms of how we will be working together, as I said, several fronts. 
But this is not something that will not exclude other clients, potential clients. So as we find ways to provide the capacity people need and the low carbon that people need, plus a digital overlay. That is certainly something that we believe will be attractive to a lot of clients. So Green Blend and Extend, for example was an interesting solution for a lot of the big mining companies that wanted to lower their carbon footprint and have cheaper energy. And again, that can transition over time to net 0 solution, but it's going to take some time to get there."

I mean what we're really working with is sort of co-creating with clients and co-creating what they want. And I think again we're also uniquely positioned to do that, not only because of the various technologies we're involved in, but also, quite frankly our modus operandi with the client. 
So if you think of something like KIUC in the first sort of 24/7 renewables, load-following renewable solution in Hawaii, that was codeveloped with them. So the same way we like we're working with Google, we are working with other people. What we've done in Chile, we've also worked with the client. 
So I hope that answers your question. So no, I don't see this way off in the future. I see there's a certain relatively short term and growing over time as the clients become more clear exactly what they want, and some of the technologies get cheaper."

As Gustavo said, we have cost cuts inherent. We have lower financing costs as well. So all those are pluses. 
So I'd say the ones that are outside of our control, to some extent a little bit would be the demand growth in the utilities, and a little bit the timing of filling up the tolling capacity in Central America and Carribbean."

Today, I will cover both our near-term priorities and the progress we have made on our larger strategic goals. On our last call, I outlined 3 top priorities: first,",1960,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review call. Today, I will cover both our near-term priorities and the progress we have made on our larger strategic goals. On our last call, I outlined 3 top priorities: first, achieving our 2020 guidance; second, attaining a second investment-grade rating; and third, decarbonizing our portfolio. We see all 3 of these goals, both individually and collectively, as catalysts for attracting a wider investor base. Perhaps more importantly, we see all 3 as clear demonstrations of our ability to thrive in today's evolving landscape.
Today, I am pleased to report that we're making great progress on all of these objectives and have several exciting developments to discuss. First, as Gustavo will review in his remarks, our portfolio continues to prove its resiliency in the face of COVID-19, and we're on track to achieve our full year guidance. In fact, we expect to be at the top end of the ranges for both adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow.
Turning to our goal of attaining a second investment-grade rating. I'm proud to say that we were upgraded by S&P earlier this week. This reflects the low level of risk inherent in our current business model. Two investment-grade ratings will help us reduce our overall cost of capital and enable us to attract a broader investor base. Following this milestone, we remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet and increasing the percentage of our business in the U.S.
Now to our third priority of aggressive decarbonization on Slide 4. As you may recall, we set a near-term target to reduce our coal generation to below 30% of total generation by the end of this year and to below 10% by 2030. I'm happy to report that with today's announced retirement of an additional 1.2 gigawatts, we have reduced our coal generation to 29% on a pro forma basis. 3/4 of these retirements are in the U.S., and the remainder are in Chile. Importantly, these retirements were already anticipated in our guidance, and we will achieve our decarbonization targets while delivering on our financial commitments. We see the transformation of our portfolio as an ongoing process, and we expect to announce additional coal retirements and asset sales in the near term. However, this milestone is significant in that it puts us in compliance with the environmental criteria of several large investors, including Norges Bank. In the longer term, we expect to produce net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Moving to our long-term strategy and the progress we've made to date. As we have discussed previously, our strategy revolves around 3 core themes: one, investing in sustainable growth; two, offering innovative solutions; and three, delivering superior results.
Turning to Slide 5. We are well positioned to meet our strategic and financial objectives. So far this year, we have signed PPAs for 2.1 gigawatts of wind, solar and energy storage projects, which is the most we have signed in the first 3 quarters of any given year.  
On to Slide 6. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts, which is also the largest in our history. Approximately 1/3 is under construction, with the majority expected to come online through 2022. Almost half of this backlog is in the U.S., which we expect to grow as a proportion of our business going forward. Our backlog includes a mix of solar, wind, energy storage and our Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile. We continue to make good progress at Alto Maipo, where construction is more than 96% complete.
As you can see on Slide 7, renewables are now nearly 40% of our installed capacity, and this proportion will grow materially as we complete the 6.8 gigawatts in our 100% renewable backlog and sell and retire additional coal plants. In addition to our renewables backlog, we see significant growth opportunities at our 2 U.S. utilities, DP&L and IPL. We are pleased with the recent developments at IP&L (sic) [ DP&L, ] where we reached a constructive settlement on various pending regulatory proceedings. Gustavo will provide additional details shortly, but this settlement is truly a milestone for DP&L as it grows its rate base and its network.
Turning to Slide 8. I have previously discussed that our Green Blend and Extend strategy, where we work with existing customers to convert the power sold from thermal to renewable generation while extending the contract life. This approach allows all parties to meet their financial and environmental objectives. Since our last call, we signed an additional 410 megawatts of solar capacity under a 17-year contract in Chile, bringing our total Green Blend and Extend execution to more than 2 gigawatts. As a demonstration of the strength of our existing coal contracts, in August, AES Gener reached an agreement with BHP for early termination, resulting in a payment of $720 million, which we will use in part to fund our renewables growth in Chile.
While we only report on our projects with signed PPAs, as you can see on Slide 9, we have a robust development pipeline, which we believe is one of our key differentiators. We currently have a development pipeline of 25 gigawatts in key markets, of which 12 gigawatts are in the U.S. Over the past couple of months, we have been solidifying our pipeline by securing land and interconnection rights. We already have very capable solar and energy storage development teams, and we recently acquired a group of experienced wind developers.
Expected renewables growth in the U.S. is currently 20 gigawatts per year. However, this rate could accelerate. We are very well positioned to take advantage of any increase in the rate of growth in demand for renewables. Furthermore, we also could benefit from an extension of ITC and PTC incentives for renewables as well as the potential for new incentives for stand-alone storage.
Turning to Slide 10 and our LNG strategy. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth by offering a clean, predictable and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system. We are focusing our LNG business in 3 markets: the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace coal and higher-cost fuel oils.
As you may know, we're developing an efficient 2.2 gigawatt combined cycle gas facility and a 450 tera BTU LNG terminal in Vietnam. We have hit key milestones towards closing these projects, which will help meet Vietnam's rapidly growing electricity demand. Last week, we signed a term sheet for the LNG terminal in partnership with PV GAS, the state-owned gas utility. In parallel, we have seen strong interest from potential lenders to finance the majority of the capital costs.
In Central America and the Caribbean, we continue to lead the transition to cleaner natural gas. We currently have a total of 150 tera BTUs of LNG storage capacity, and an additional 50 tera BTUs is under construction in the Dominican Republic. We now have contracted 60% of this storage capacity, and we're in advanced discussions for an additional 20%. This would bring our total contracted volume to 80% in 2023 and beyond. For context, 200 tera BTU of LNG volume can serve approximately 3 gigawatts of natural gas generation.
Moving on Slide 11. The second component of our strategy is offering innovative solutions. We see the energy needs of our clients, like Google, evolving to achieve the highest standards in clean energy. We are leading this transition through our unique integration of renewables with our scalable platforms of Fluence, 5B and Uplight. Our technological innovation gives us a key competitive advantage. An example is energy storage, where we have access to the latest technology in the sector and combine it with our unique industry insights to create transformative clean energy solutions. As a reminder, working closely with our customer, KIUC in Hawaii, we were the first company to develop a true 24/7 solar and energy storage project, and we continue to advance new applications. In fact, we recently inaugurated the world's first virtual reservoir in Chile, which combines run-of-the-river hydro with battery-based energy storage, allowing us to sell our energy when prices are highest.
Turning to Slide 12. Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to maintain its position as the market leader in the sector. This year, Fluence has been awarded 690 megawatts of contracts, increasing their awarded or delivered capacity to 2.4 gigawatts. Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million this year, an increase of 400% compared to last year.
While rapidly growing their backlog, Fluence continues to enhance their digital capabilities and to complement their suite of solutions. To that end, Fluence acquired AMS, the leading provider of AI-enabled bidding software for storage and generation assets. Through the AMS acquisition, Fluence now has ongoing contracts for digital bidding services for more than 2.4 gigawatts, most of it, additional to Fluence's fleet. The integration of this technology to Fluence's current offerings will help optimize the use of energy storage and to ensure the greatest value for their clients.
We're also looking to additional new products and innovation that could transform the sector, as shown on Slide 13. With our recent investment in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and on half as much land. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become a great differentiator as solar penetration increases, especially near urban and congested areas.
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our own development pipeline. We aim to be the most competitive solar operator and developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density in combination with our ongoing robotic and digital initiatives.
One example of how we are integrating all of these technologies to improve customer outcomes is the Andes II B project in Chile. This project consists of 180 megawatts of solar, incorporates 10 megawatts of 5B's technology and includes 560 megawatt hours of energy storage, the largest in Latin America.
Another example of our leading innovations is our Uplight platform, which is helping utilities improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. Both of these capabilities are increasingly relevant to Uplight's 100 million end users and 80 utility customers in the U.S.
Finally, as I previously discussed, we continue to be on the forefront of new technologies. To that end, we have been running tests on hydrogen at several thermal plants in Latin America. We consider ourselves to be well positioned to be a leader to incorporate green hydrogen if and when it becomes economic sometime in the future.
Turning now to the third component of our strategy, which Gustavo will spend more time on: delivering superior results. By investing in our development pipeline, we are earning attractive risk-adjusted returns. As you can see on Slide 14, in the U.S., we're earning low double-digit returns, while internationally, we're earning mid- to high-teen returns.
Before concluding, I would like to note that last week, we launched a new brand with a new logo, as you can see on our slides. We have transformed AES into a leader in clean energy, and our new brand symbolizes our position at the forefront of the technological and commercial changes that are redefining our industry.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."
35312,690896121,2133032,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 06, 2020",2020-11-06,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan.Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade,",1349,"Thank you, Andrés, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the third quarter, and our capital allocation plan.
Let me start with our resilient business model. Over the last decade, we have proactively transformed our portfolio. And now 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years, supported by credit-worthy off-takers. At the same time, more than 80% of our earnings are now in dollars. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow.
Turning to Slide 16. You can see how our portfolio has performed during these challenging times. As you know, a majority of our customers are large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. As a result, Q3 receivables and days sales outstanding remained stable and very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to Slide 17. The impact of the global lockdown on our financial results has been mostly limited to our utilities. Our generation businesses have been largely unaffected due to the take-or-pay nature of contracts and customers being deemed essential. As you may recall, in our first quarter call, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. Since then, demand performance has been better than our expectation. For Q3, our initial projection was for a demand drop of about 5% to 7% at our U.S. utilities, while the actual result was significantly less severe than anticipated. On a weather-normalized basis, the net combined volume at DPL and IPL is mostly flat. Demand at DPL was up 3%, largely driven by the higher load from residential customers, while demand at IPL was down 3% as the load from commercial and industrial customers has yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, the total net impact of the lower demand on our utilities was only $0.01 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.02 to $0.03.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 18. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 for the quarter versus $0.48 last year. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.11 impact, most related to last year's insurance recovery and an outage that occurred this quarter at one of our facilities in Dominican Republic, which is already back in operations. Results also reflect the regulatory changes that were implemented at DP&L and in Argentina in Q4 2019. These headwinds were partially offset by higher contributions from the Southland repowering project, our Eurasia SBU, our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives as well as a lower tax rate.
Turning to Slide 19. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $331 million for the quarter, a decrease of $95 million versus the third quarter of 2019. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 20.
In the US and Utilities SBU, PTC remained relatively flat. The benefit from the commencement of PPAs at Southland Energy CCGTs was mostly offset by the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL in 2019 as well as lower demand at our utilities due to the impact of COVID-19.
Before moving on, I would like to take a moment to update you on recent regulatory developments at DP&L on Slide 21. I'm very pleased to announce that we have reached a successful settlement with PUCO staff and key intervenors, resolving 4 open proceedings, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty and allowing us to move forward with our smart grid investments. More specifically as a result of this settlement, DP&L committed to file a new ESP by October 1, 2023, and will continue to recover its approximately $80 million annual rate stabilization charge until the new ESP becomes effective. DP&L will make smart grid investments of $249 million over the next 4 years, which will earn a return through the investment infrastructure rider. Resolution was reached on the 2 pending retroactive SEET tests related to 2018 and 2019. And DP&L passed the SEET and MFA regulatory tests filed earlier this year.
Now turning back to our third quarter results on Slide 22. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was primarily driven by drier hydrology at the Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, resulting in lower generation and high energy purchases. Lower PTC at our MCAC SBU primarily reflects the outage-related impacts I discussed previously as well as the arbitration settlement at Changuinola this year.
Finally, in Eurasia, higher results reflect lower maintenance and outages as well as lower interest expense due to debt repayment in 2020. It also includes a favorable variance in India given the OPGC COD delay last year.
Now to Slide 25. To summarize our performance in the first 3 quarters of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.96 versus $1.02 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. In fact, based on our strong year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are now expecting to be at the top end of this range.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 26. As we have discussed on our prior calls, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. As Andrés mentioned, we recently received our second investment-grade rating. We are very pleased that S&P has recognized the underlying quality and strength of our portfolio. As you can see on this slide, we have improved our ratings by 2 to 3 notches over the last 4 years. Strong credit metrics remain one of our top priorities, and we'll continue to take steps to maintain and further improve upon current levels.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 27. We expected $1.5 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is roughly $100 million higher than our prior disclosure.
Regarding asset sales, today, we are very pleased to announce a sell-down of 35% of our interest in the Southland repowering projects for $424 million to Ullico, expanding from our successful partnership at sPower. This transaction demonstrates the substantial intrinsic value of our portfolio and how we benefit from our platform and long-term contracted assets. As you may recall, Southland has a 20-year contract and was commissioned early this year. This sell-down implies a total equity value of more than $1.2 billion. With this transaction, combined with our previously announced asset sales, we have exceeded our proceeds target for the year by approximately $100 million for a total of $650 million. Further, based on our year-to-date performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now also expect parent free cash flow to come in at the top end of our range of $725 million to $775 million.
Moving to the right-hand side, uses are largely unchanged from the last quarter, except the investments in our subsidiaries, which are roughly $200 million higher. The increase primarily reflects a temporary cash injection at Southland and higher investments in renewables. Approximately 90% of the $900 million of investments in subsidiaries are in the U.S., contributing to our goal of increasing the proportion of earnings from the U.S. to about half.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022 beginning on Slide 28. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 29. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to any review by the Board, we continue to expected to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average.
We also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

So this is sort of an add-on, and we're retiring some of the thermal assets. So it's a transition.
So it's going to be growing over time. We feel very good about the way it's sort of blending in. It's something like Green Blend and Extend. It's blending in to this growth.
So we have a backlog of 7 gigawatts. It's a good mix of U.S. and outside, and it has good returns. And there's a variety of regulatory schemes under which they operate.
So we feel good about it. It's going to be growing, and it's going to -- it's replacing some of the older thermal assets that we're retiring.
Second part of your question regarding Fluence, well realize that as I've said in the past, the faster Fluence grows, to some extent, it pushes off a little bit positive earnings. We're creating an enormous amount of value but all R&D, for example, or all upgrading of our teams around the world, that's expensed.
So when you're growing 400% this year, we expect a 40-plus growth rate going forward. We have a backlog of 1 gigawatt. So that's still off.
So there's no -- right now, Fluence is a drag of around $0.02. So it will -- everything has a positive margin. We expect this to turn around, but it's a little bit of a function of how fast we grow. So ironically the more value we create and the faster we grow, that might take a little bit more time."

And I think to your question on renewables, probably the best way to think about it is most of our free cash is going to renewables nowadays. So it's about $350 million to $400 million of investment in new renewables going forward. And you put low double-digit to mid-teen returns, and you see that this is going to be an important driver of earnings going forward."

So really what we see is that there is a true competitive advantage of combining our existing platforms with the new. And I say that because it's easy to talk about renewables, but really that's just energy. And what the market is demanding is capacity. So you're going to get that capacity in the short term from your existing traditional facilities and then with energy storage.
So thinking about that, nobody is in a better position than us to do that because we really are the leader in the -- not only the amount of energy storage, but more important, I think the new applications, finding new ways to use this. So I feel very good about this sort of leading this transition in a very responsible way, retiring our coal plants, selling coal plants, providing that capacity to some extent in other new markets in -- with gas because quite frankly not all markets are capable with today's technology of efficiently providing capacity. Even with batteries, it would be too expensive with renewables.
So we're leading that transition to a lower-carbon future. But at the same time, I think we're uniquely integrating, be it energy storage, be it innovative renewables. I mean I think 5B, that technology will play a greater role in the future as you get greater really penetration of solar in some areas. And so being able to do it in a smaller space is very valuable. Being able to do it faster is very valuable.
We're really doing some very interesting things on robotics. We're doing some very interesting things in digital, digital controls. And so Uplight is one aspect of it. But so is, for example, the purchase of AMS by Fluence.
So that's a little bit how I see it. So while it's true that there is a premium today for pure renewable plays, we think there'll be a premium tomorrow for those companies that truly satisfy what customers need. So it's not only energy. It's energy plus capacity. And we will lead the way into providing capacity, energy and customer-facing solutions into the future. So it's a very interesting transition, even though it's a little bit complicated story."

As I said, several fronts.
But this is not something that will not exclude other clients, potential clients. So as we find ways to provide the capacity people need and the low carbon that people need, plus a digital overlay, that is certainly something that we believe will be attractive to a lot of clients. So Green Blend and Extend, for example, was an interesting solution for a lot of the big mining companies that wanted to lower their carbon footprint and have cheaper energy. And again, that can transition over time to net-zero solution, but it's going to take some time to get there."

So if you think of something like KIUC in the first sort of 24/7 renewables, load-following renewable solution in Hawaii, that was codeveloped with them. So the same way we like were working with Google, we are working with other people. What we've done in Chile, we've also worked with the client.

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We",1409,"Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million.
At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by a 11 percentage points to 34%. We're working on a couple of additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank's criteria by next year.
To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise.
In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections.
Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tietê, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan to upgrade AES Tietê's listing to Novo Mercado on the Bovespa, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tietê for the benefit of all of its shareholders.
We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our customers.
This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025.
Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years.
As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours.
As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component.
Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban or congested areas.
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives.
Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million household and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020.
Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these firm up.
In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market.
Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are",1527,"Thanks, Andrés. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings.
As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02.
Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take-or-pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We intentionally work with high-quality off-takers, and this strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our business model.
For example, as you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on Slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. This assumed the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our US and Utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities, I just discussed, and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL and Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives.
Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 22.
In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile.
Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama, following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom.
Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions for new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter, and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give us confidence in attaining our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses.
Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities.
Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize the value of some of its store in agreements. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in 2020.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We're also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

Look, we have, I think, a very good track record in Brazil of creating value in our separate companies. If you think of the sale of Sul, the sale of Eletropaulo, you think of the sale of our telecom Atimus. So what we're doing here is we're -- BNDES",297,"Sure.

If you think of the sale of Sul, the sale of Eletropaulo, you think of the sale of our telecom Atimus. So what we're doing here is we're -- BNDES wanted to sell part of its share. So by buying BNDES' shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tietê on the Novo Mercado. In the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10%, 20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listings.
So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend uplift. And then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDES' shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So it's one share one vote, we still control this company.
I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there the Tietê actually is a good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money point of view because we're buying it accretive. We are -- it's accretive at these prices. Second, I would say that it's a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity, the carbon intensity of our footprint."

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it all",643,"Well, we started 12 years ago. So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long distance transmission expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. So I think this is an area that's going to grow very quickly.
So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you know, our award-winning project out in Kiewit. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want 24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component.
Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for -- our batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to -- in some cases, a chemical back to electric. And the losses are very low.
There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and then it has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that batteries seem to be the killer app.
Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant.
So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction. Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you're talking about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage. 
Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation."

Anything that you're doing differently or you probably have more contracted type generation. I realize that, but is there anything else going on?"

It's 85% of our business is contracted generation. And we have credit-worthy off-takers. So there are situations, for example, where, say, a currency depreciates but what they're exporting is actually then mo",209,"Yes. No, I think you hit the nail on the head. It's 85% of our business is contracted generation. And we have credit-worthy off-takers. So there are situations, for example, where, say, a currency depreciates but what they're exporting is actually then more attractive because they have a portion of their costs, whether it'd be mining or such things that they're exporting. So in general, our clients are doing well. Much better than the markets that they're in. So I think that's very important. But we're 85% contracted generation. And that's a big difference.
So if you actually see why we guided down initially. We correctly forecasted that we would have a drop in demand with the quarantine at our utilities, at our distribution businesses. So that's what's going on. But other than that, our plants are critical. So in those cases, where we're selling to the grid or selling to, which is, in many cases, backed by the government, we are -- make sure that we get paid because we're absolutely critical to the grid or the low-cost generator in that market. So we're very well positioned in this crisis. So we don't expect that to change, certainly, in the generation business, given, let's say, the current outlook."

We're not going to sell down a very large stake, we're talking of around a 10% stake. So we think it would be just good to have that capitalize it, maybe 10% with an outside partner. And obviously work towards a bigger sell-down perhaps in 2, 3 years of an IPO. But -- and then we'll have to reassess strategically how we feel about this business.
But we feel very good about the business. And as I said, I think that this is a market, which is growing very rapidly. Now something that people haven't talked about, I think, so much is, if you do have a change in federal policies in the U.S. to promote green or carbon-free generation, we're very well positioned. Fluence is very well positioned. But specifically, AES because we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of potential projects in the U.S. And those run the range from quite advance to medium advance.
If we looked at just hypothetical projects, it's a much bigger number. So we feel good that we have a pipeline that we could execute on and potentially double our rate of growth of renewable build in the U.S. should there be such a change."

So look, we've talked probably, I'd say around 2 years for it to turn positive in terms of EPS. And what basically happens is that the faster it grows, the more new products you have to come out with, you delay that, turning it positive. So it's a business that could be positive today if that were the objective. But the objective is to create value. So we think a sell it down, as you say, will give us a marker.

So as you become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade by Fitch, but you get those additional investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables. 
But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help yourselves quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt."

So you have to convince somebody, a third-party, that you're going to operate this and that they think it's a good project as well.
So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel.

The issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that were produced in some factories. So we've operated for 12 years. This is the first, let's say, serious incident we've had. But really, the best standards are, for example, UL 9045a. And if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth generation incorporates all these.
So if you look at, for example, it doesn't require -- it's not contained, so it's actually outside. The modules are separated, so you don't have cotangents. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it's not enclosed, the heat and any gases would rise. So definitely, we feel that we've taken all the lessons learned from this event. We've incorporated into the new design. And really, safety was one of our #1 priority. So again, we have 12 years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had.
Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on them with one hand, all those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.
So yes, we -- as you know, safety is #1 value, super important for us. We have been very serious and very diligent, I think, about looking into this and supporting our clients and supporting our local fire departments on this.

So I really can't give you too much color on it, other than saying that it will help us. It will help Gener with its financing plan.

And thank you for joining our second quarter financial review call. Today, I'll spend some time on 3 near term priorities: achieving our 2020 guidance, attaining a second investment-grade rating and decarbonizing our portfolio. We believe that progress in these 3 key areas will allow us to reach a larger investor base in the near term. They will also advance our longer term strategic and financial objectives. After discussing these 3 themes, I'll provide an update on our sustainable growth initiatives and our efforts to create a technological competitive edge.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were well positioned to withstand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resilience of our business model. I am pleased to report that our second quarter results demonstrate this resilience and keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25 in the second quarter in line with last year. This reflects the strength of our business model, which is based on long-term take-or-pay contracts with creditworthy customers. As a result, we are very confident that we will achieve our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.32 to $1.42, and our expected parent free cash flow of $725 million to $775 million.
At the same time, we have continued to grow our free cash flow. We ended the second quarter with a parent free cash flow to debt ratio of 24%, which is comfortably above the 20% threshold required for investment-grade ratings. As a reminder, we've already received one investment-grade rating from Fitch and remain optimistic that we will attain our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Turning to our aggressive decarbonization goals on Slide 4. As we've said before, we are very focused on reducing our generation from coal to less than 30% of total generation to comply with Norges Bank Environmental Investment Criteria. On this front, we've made great progress over the past 2 months, signing binding agreements to sell OPGC in India and Itabo in the Dominican Republic. These sales will reduce our generation from coal by a 11 percentage points to 34%. We're working on a couple of additional transactions that combined with our growth in renewables will allow us to easily comply with Norges Bank's criteria by next year.
To further our reduction in coal exposure, AES Gener is negotiating with several off-takers in Chile to delink PPAs from physical assets and be able to monetize the value of long-term tolling agreements. These transactions will demonstrate that the real value of the business is in its contracts and customers while providing funding for AES Gener's successful green blend and extend renewables growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 5 and sustainable growth. I'm happy to announce that since our last call, we have been awarded or signed 852 megawatts of new renewable PPAs. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.5 gigawatts, including 346 megawatts of energy storage. As a result, our backlog of new renewable projects increased to 6.2 gigawatts. About half of this backlog is in the U.S., and the majority is expected to come online between 2021 and 2024. Therefore, we remain on track to continue to add 2 to 3 gigawatts of new renewables per year by capitalizing on our business platforms and our growing technological expertise.
In addition to our 6.2 gigawatt backlog, we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of renewable projects under active development in the U.S. This considerable pipeline positions us very well for an acceleration in U.S. renewables growth if federal policies change following the November elections.
Turning to Slide 7. We're also consolidating our position in existing renewable platforms. To that end, we recently acquired additional shares of AES Tietê, increasing our ownership from 24% to 43%. We will finance this acquisition mostly through nonrecourse debt in Brazil, and it is accretive from day 1. We plan to upgrade AES Tietê's listing to Novo Mercado on the Bovespa, where companies trade at significant premiums due to best-in-class governance. This move is expected to further unlock the value of AES Tietê for the benefit of all of its shareholders.
We continue to actively pursue new technologies that support our growth in renewables and innovative products that meet the changing needs of our customers. As you can see on Slide 8, Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens that sells energy storage technology to third parties, continues to be the global market leader in this sector. This leadership is based on our track record of deploying more than 2 gigawatts of energy storage, presence in 22 countries and offering more than 40 digital applications to our customers.
This year, Fluence's revenue is expected to reach $500 million, an increase of 400% in relation to last year. We believe that energy storage will play a major role in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. As a result, we expect Fluence's revenue to grow at 40% compounded annually to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025.
Turning to Slide 9. We are already experiencing this acceleration of growth in demand for energy storage. In June, Fluence launched its sixth generation product, which includes a modular and factory assembled cube design that is safer, more reliable and lower cost. Fluence's new cube already has orders for more than 800 megawatts to be delivered over the next 3 years.
As you may know, Fluence is currently running a private placement for a minority partner in order to capitalize this high-growth business. We are encouraged by the strong interest we are seeing from potential investors, and we expect to have concrete details to share with you before the end of the year. Together, AES and Fluence continue to pioneer new applications for lithium-ion based energy storage technology. One example is a virtual reservoir for run of the river hydro projects, utilizing energy storage that charges when power prices are low and discharges during peak hours.
As shown on Slide 10, at the Cordillera hydro complex in Chile, we just commissioned the world's first such virtual reservoir, with 10 megawatts or 50-megawatt hours of energy storage. We can further expand this facility to 250 megawatts or 1,250 megawatt hours over the next couple of years. Today, about half of all our renewable projects have an energy storage component.
Now moving on to Slide 11. We continue to pursue new technologies that have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage in our markets. To that end, we recently acquired a 25% stake in 5B, a prefabricated solar solution company in Australia. With 5B's patented technology, solar projects can be built in 1/3 of the time and in half the space. We believe that being able to double solar energy output from a given area will become increasingly important as solar penetration increases, especially near urban or congested areas.
In addition to 5B's potential pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts of third-party projects in Australia, we see an additional addressable market of 5 gigawatts across our development pipeline. As part of this strategic agreement, we have exclusive rights to develop utility-scale projects using 5B's technology in our key markets, including the U.S. We have already started the deployment of 2 megawatts in Panama and 10 megawatts in Chile. We aim to be the most competitive solar developer by using 5B to reduce time to build and increase energy density, while combining it with our robotic and digital solar initiatives.
Turning to Slide 12. In 2018, AES invested in Uplight to improve our customer experiences via digital cloud based technology. In addition, Uplight provides cloud-based services to third parties to improve energy efficiency and balance system demand. This fast-growing business already reaches more than 100 million household and businesses in the U.S. and expects a 20% increase in annual revenue in 2020.
Finally, regarding our partnership with Google, it is progressing well. And as you might have seen, we recently launched an RFP for 1 gigawatt of carbon-free energy in PJM. We are working on several other significant initiatives with Google, and we will share additional details as these firm up.
In summary, our ongoing leading technology efforts aim to give us a competitive edge to deliver the products and services required by our customers in a rapidly evolving and growing market.
Now I would like to turn over the call to Gustavo Pimenta, our CFO, so he can provide more color on our results, debt profile and guidance."

Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are",1527,"Thanks, Andrés. Today, I'll cover 3 key topics: our resilient business model, our performance during the second quarter and our capital allocation plan.
Let me start with our resilient business model on Slide 14. As you can see, 85% of our earnings are from utilities and long-term contracted generation with an average contract life of 14 years. This provides significant stability to earnings and cash flow. We have also reduced our exposure to volatility in foreign currency by growing the portion of our U.S. dollar earnings.
As you can see on Slide 15, today, 85% of our earnings are in U.S. dollars as compared to approximately 60% a few years ago. For context, through 2022, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would reduce our annualized EPS by only 1.5% or $0.02.
Looking at Latin America, specifically, almost all of our businesses in that region are contracted, as you can see on Slide 16. Nearly 60% of these businesses have no volumetric risk as a result of the take-or-pay nature of the contracts. The remaining capacity is mostly contracted with large industrials and export-oriented mining companies that continue to operate despite COVID-19 as they are deemed essential. We intentionally work with high-quality off-takers, and this strategy is also contributing to the resilience of our business model.
For example, as you can see on Slide 17, roughly 2/3 of our customers in Latin America have investment-grade profiles. The remaining customers are largely backed by government-owned institutions. The result of this resilient contracting structure and customer base can be seen in our collections performance on Slide 18, with Q2 receivables and days sales outstanding remaining very much in line with historical levels.
Moving on to the impact of global lockdowns on our financial results on Slide 19. As you may recall, we had anticipated an extended U-shaped recovery in energy demand across our markets. This assumed the second quarter would be the hardest hit with a demand drop of about 10% to 12% at our U.S. utility businesses and between 7% and 15% internationally. The actual result was not as severe as anticipated, with volume at our US and Utilities dropping mid-single digits and demand in other markets declining in the range of low single digits to low double digits. As I have noted, our generation businesses did not experience any material impact on earnings from lower demand. Our utility business, where most of our volume exposure has experienced an impact of about $0.02 on adjusted EPS for the quarter, better than our initial expectation of $0.03 to $0.04. Despite these encouraging results, we continue to assume an extended U-shaped recovery for guidance purpose, given the overall uncertainty around the macro environment.
Now turning to our quarterly results on Slide 20. Adjusted EPS was $0.25 for the quarter versus $0.26 last year. This reflects the lower demand at our regulated utilities, I just discussed, and the regulatory changes that were implemented at DPL and Argentina in 2019. We are able to offset these headwinds through higher contributions from our South America and Eurasia SBUs as well as our cost savings and deleveraging initiatives.
Turning to Slide 21. Adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, was relatively flat at $238 million for the quarter, with a decrease of only $2 million versus the second quarter of 2019. I will cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides beginning on Slide 22.
In the US and Utilities SBU, lower PTC reflects the lower regulated tariff implemented in Q4 2019 due to the reversion to ESP 1 rates at DPL as well as lower demand at utilities due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, at Southland, we had lower capacity revenues as a result of the retirement of some of our legacy units in 2019. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was primarily driven by higher contributions from AES Gener, including better operating performance at our Guacolda plant and recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile.
Higher PTC at our MCAC SBU reflects improved availability at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama, following an extended major outage last year. We also benefited from improved hydrology in Panama, following a very dry year in 2019. This was partially offset by outage-related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic last year. Finally, in Eurasia, high results reflect improved operational performance in Vietnam and the impact of the sale of our loss-making business in the United Kingdom.
Now to Slide 26. To summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.54 versus $0.53 last year. We are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.32 to $1.42. Relative to the first half of 2020, performance in the second half of the year will benefit from contributions for new businesses, including the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project, for which the 20-year contract began in the second quarter, and about 1 gigawatt of renewables coming online.
Now turning to our credit profile on Slide 27. As we discussed on our first quarter call, since 2011, we reduced our parent debt by approximately $3 billion or about 50%. At the end of the second quarter, our parent leverage was 3.5x, and our parent free cash flow to that ratio was 24%, comfortably within the investment-grade thresholds of 4x and 20%, respectively. This highlights once more our credit strength and give us confidence in attaining our second investment-grade rating later this year.
Moving on to liquidity on Slide 28. We have $3.5 billion in available liquidity, 2/3 of which is in cash. As you may recall from our prior call, we had taken a conservative approach to enhance our liquidity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak by drawing on about $500 million of our revolvers. As a result of the strong collection we experienced in the quarter, we decided to pay back most of these facilities, lowering the overall interest expense for our businesses.
Next, I I'd like to provide an update on our refinancings on Slide 29. As you know, we have been proactively strengthening our debt maturity profile. Since last year, we executed more than $7 billion in liability management across our portfolio. In the second quarter alone, by taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, we refinanced more than $2 billion of debt, significantly reducing our interest costs while eliminating any material refinancing needs at both AES Corp. and DPL for the next 5 years.
Now to 2020 parent capital allocation on Slide 30. We expected $1.4 billion of discretionary cash this year, which is largely consistent with our previous disclosure. Regarding asset sales, we have already announced agreement to sell 2 gigawatts of cogeneration, achieving roughly half of our target for 2020. We are working on a few other transactions and feel good about the prospect of achieving our targeted asset sales of $550 million for this year.
Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we expected to return $381 million to shareholders this year. We plan to invest $700 million in our subsidiaries, 90% of which is in the U.S., demonstrating our proactive actions to grow the portion of earnings coming from the U.S. to about half by 2022. These investments include funding our renewables backlog, the equity for the Southland repowering and the investment in rate base growth at our utilities.
Regarding AES Gener, as Andrés mentioned, we are in negotiations to delink the PPAs from the coal assets and monetize the value of some of its store in agreements. As a result, we now expect the capital increase in our contribution of equity to happen in 2021. This leaves us with up to $317 million to be allocated in 2020.
Next, moving to our capital allocation from 2020 through 2022, beginning on Slide 31. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $3.4 billion in discretionary cash. 3/4 of this is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, with the remaining $900 million coming from asset sale proceeds.
Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 1/3 will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Subject to annual review by the Board, we continue to expect to increase the dividend by 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We're also expected to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new projected PPAs, T&D investments at IPL, the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project and the investment in AES Gener. This $1.9 billion also included the $300 million infrastructure investment in DP&L. Once completed, these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond.
In summary, we are very encouraged by our solid financial performance to date despite being in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis. Our performance and position validate the actions we have taken over the last several years to materially improve the quality and resilience of our business model, and we remain very confident in our ability to continue delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrés."

If you think of the sale of Sul, the sale of Eletropaulo, you think of the sale of our telecom Atimus. So what we're doing here is we're -- BNDES wanted to sell part of its share. So by buying BNDES' shares, we go from 24% ownership to around 43% ownership. This will allow us to list AES Tietê on the Novo Mercado. In the Novo Mercado, generally companies trade at a 10%, 20% premium versus where they trade on ordinary listings.
So in Brazil, you have your preferred shares, which actually don't have a vote and receive a 10% dividend uplift. And then you have normal ordinary shares, which have votes. So our shares and BNDES' shares are ordinary shares. So what we see here is an upgrade of the company in terms of its market listing, in terms of who can invest in the company. And we're able to go to Novo Mercado because now we own a much larger percentage of the company. So it's one share one vote, we still control this company.
I'd say furthermore, you might have seen there the Tietê actually is a good platform for growth. It has now almost 4 gigawatts of 100% renewable energy. And we've been able to do some very innovative things there. So in terms of our big strategy, it makes sense as well. So it makes sense from a money point of view because we're buying it accretive. We are -- it's accretive at these prices. Second, I would say that it's a platform for growth and fits into our overall strategy of reducing our carbon intensity, the carbon intensity of our footprint."

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications.

So we have a long history of energy storage. And we've really been an innovator in applications. So we've decided to sell it to third parties via Fluence, and we're very happy with the partnership with Siemens because it allows us to sell it in 160 countries. So what we're seeing is that this is a very rapidly growing market. So Fluence itself, we see a lot of new applications, not only the virtual reservoir, but I can see grid booster, which really reduces significant long distance transmission expenses or investments. So that, I think, is the next front. So I think this is an area that's going to grow very quickly.
So how does it fit in into AES. Well, first, of course, we're happy with the investments we've made in Fluence. I think time will show that, that was a very good investment. But it's also good for us in the sense we're one of the big customers of Fluence. So today, half of our product offerings have an energy storage component. So we have stand-alone storage, but we also have it integrated into solar, as you know, our award-winning project out in Kiewit. But we also have it incorporated, for example, wind. So when we talk about green blend and extend and meeting customers' future needs, if customers want 24/7, for example, renewables, energy storage plays a big component.
Now I'm a believer in lithium-ion batteries for -- our batteries, let's say, electrical batteries because they don't have to be lithium ion for the next 5 to 10 years for many of the applications. And the reason is that it's very -- as the batteries become more efficient, become cheaper, you're basically going from electric to -- in some cases, a chemical back to electric. And the losses are very low.
There's been a lot of talk about hydrogen, for example. Hydrogen has advantages and then it has much greater energy density. So we see much -- many more applications in transportation where the weight of batteries precludes long distance, say, big trucks using a battery. So I think this is a very interesting area. But if you're talking about sort of combining renewables with storage or day-to-day applications, we really think that batteries seem to be the killer app.
Now we've put a toe in the water into hydrogen as well. We've actually run some tests on old coal plants in Chile, basically cracking the hydrogen, using renewable energy at around $35 a megawatt hour, and it still comes out quite expensive. We do see it could be -- we've also run some tests on diesel, and it might be interesting for micro grids. So we do have an electrolyzer in Chile, where we -- actually, in Argentina, excuse me, where we actually produce hydrogen for our own needs at the San Nicolas plant.
So we have a foot into this. We're looking into this. But I just mentioned this because there some people say, well, hydrogen will replace battery-based energy storage. And the reason we don't see that is, at least in the short term, is because you're going from electric to produce a chemical -- a chemical reaction. Then you have to store it cryogenically, then you have to transport it, then you basically have to burn it again. So if you look at the energy from the original electricity losses to electricity again, you're talking about at least half. Whereas with the battery, you're talking about a much smaller percentage. 
Now of course, batteries don't work for intraseasonal differences. So we're looking into it. And we have some small experiments in some of our different units. And as I said, the ones that look more promising really are diesel units. And we're certainly a believer of green hydrogen for transportation."

And we did have the RFP -- we have the RFP out for 1 gigawatt of zero-carbon energy in PJM.
We're also -- as I mentioned in my speech, looking at other possibilities with them, I really can't comment on them -- about them at this time. But it goes beyond just a single sort of RFP or a single PPA in one country. Because we're doing, I think, a lot of innovative things like they are, and so we have commonality of interest in some areas. But just like Google, I mean, of course, there are other companies that are also interested in our global footprint. And having a, let's say, common high-tech approach to reducing carbon emissions among multiple countries, and we can certainly supply that."

So in general, our clients are doing well. Much better than the markets that they're in. So I think that's very important. But we're 85% contracted generation. And that's a big difference.
So if you actually see why we guided down initially. We correctly forecasted that we would have a drop in demand with the quarantine at our utilities, at our distribution businesses. So that's what's going on. But other than that, our plants are critical. So in those cases, where we're selling to the grid or selling to, which is, in many cases, backed by the government, we are -- make sure that we get paid because we're absolutely critical to the grid or the low-cost generator in that market. So we're very well positioned in this crisis. So we don't expect that to change, certainly, in the generation business, given, let's say, the current outlook."

But we feel very good about the business. And as I said, I think that this is a market, which is growing very rapidly. Now something that people haven't talked about, I think, so much is, if you do have a change in federal policies in the U.S. to promote green or carbon-free generation, we're very well positioned. Fluence is very well positioned. But specifically, AES because we have a pipeline of 15 gigawatts of potential projects in the U.S. And those run the range from quite advance to medium advance.
If we looked at just hypothetical projects, it's a much bigger number. So we feel good that we have a pipeline that we could execute on and potentially double our rate of growth of renewable build in the U.S. should there be such a change."

So look, we've talked probably, I'd say around 2 years for it to turn positive in terms of EPS. And what basically happens is that the faster it grows, the more new products you have to come out with, you delay that, turning it positive. So it's a business that could be positive today if that were the objective. But the objective is to create value. So we think a sell it down, as you say, will give us a marker.

So as you become investment grade, I know you're already investment-grade by Fitch, but you get those additional investment-grade ratings. Would you ever consider not project finance, but corporate-level debt to fund the growth? I understand that there's an issue of finite life of the contracts for the renewables. 
But I think that there is this growing conviction even among investors that the useful life of these assets is going to be longer than the duration of the original contract. And under project financing, you are in a sense -- the debt amortization, most of the cash flows of the project, and so the real equity accretion is only at the end of this contract. So in a sense, you could help yourselves quite meaningfully from a cash flow perspective if you were started to rely on corporate level debt -- on corporate debt."

So you have to convince somebody, a third-party, that you're going to operate this and that they think it's a good project as well.
So given that, philosophically, we like using project-level debt, and so I don't see that changing for the time. There are advantages of certain roll-ups. We can aggregate at the sublevel.

The issue as we see it was with a series of LG Chem batteries, a specific series that were produced in some factories. So we've operated for 12 years. This is the first, let's say, serious incident we've had. But really, the best standards are, for example, UL 9045a. And if you look at the best-in-class standards, the sixth generation incorporates all these.
So if you look at, for example, it doesn't require -- it's not contained, so it's actually outside. The modules are separated, so you don't have cotangents. It has enhanced fire suppression systems on it. And in the worst case, should there be any type of thermal event since it's not enclosed, the heat and any gases would rise. So definitely, we feel that we've taken all the lessons learned from this event. We've incorporated into the new design. And really, safety was one of our #1 priority. So again, we have 12 years of operating these. And we -- this is the one really event that we had.
Now regarding those cases, which weren't that many. I think you can count on them with one hand, all those units that had that series of battery in them, we immediately put out instructions of not to charge them -- like instructions you get on your Tesla car, not to charge them above 75%. And we've taken corrective actions and we've given more information, more training for like local fire units, et cetera.
So yes, we -- as you know, safety is #1 value, super important for us.
