Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times where we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which",803,"Well, thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times where we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which I will provide an update on the current environment and outlook. 
Consolidated net revenue for first quarter was $5.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-over-year. But collectively, demand for our networking, broadband and storage products continue to recover, growing 6% year-over-year. However, as expected, wireless products were down sharply year-on-year due to the -- an architectural change in touch sensing, as we explained. 
Our infrastructure software segment performed largely as expected. Brocade recovered from the bottom of 2019 and continue to stabilize very well. CA had a record quarter under Broadcom, delivering approximately $880 million of revenue or a 5% growth year-over-year. 
Finally, in this first quarter of integrating Symantec onto our platform and taking into account the impact of purchase accounting, we had revenue of approximately $400 million, which we expect will step up as the year progresses. Now this first quarter results also exclude the managed security services business, which we are divesting to Accenture. 
Now let me turn to our current thinking on the full year. Let me begin by putting into context how we initially came to our prior full year 2020 guidance. It was based on 2 primary drivers. On the infrastructure software side, we added Symantec, which in the first year, we expect to do $1.8 billion. Combined with Brocade, which is on its way back to a normalized run rate and CA, which is growing, we felt good about $7 billion from the software segment in 2020. 
Now in semiconductors. 2018 was a strong year, up high single digits. However, we're softening demand industry-wide. 2019 became challenging and was down high single digits, bottoming out in the second half of the year. So when we gave our 2020 guidance last quarter, it reflected a projected recovery from that bottom. We expected the recovery would be more gradual in the first half of 2020, which we have been seeing and then accelerate in the second half of 2020. Our confidence in that acceleration was driven by the anticipated launch of 5G phones late in the year and expected strong data center spending from enterprise and hyper cloud customers. 
So now let's talk about the impact of COVID-19 on that outlook. As I sit here today, I have not yet seen a meaningful impact on bookings. And certainly, the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact. However, there is no doubt COVID-19 has created a high level of uncertainty, which we can help but think is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular, in the second half of the fiscal year. But frankly, visibility is bad, and confidence continue to erode. So as a result, we believe it is only prudent that we withdraw our annual guidance until such time that visibility returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. 
One more point though before I move on. Keep in mind, through all the cyclicality and uncertainty, given the high degree of recurring revenue based on multiyear contracts, any uncertainty around infrastructure software revenue is likely to be very much more muted. Also, in light of the unique environment we are in, we thought it makes sense at this time to provide more color on near-term expectations, which we have better visibility. We expect our second quarter revenue to be $5.7 billion, which reflects a typical sequential drop, slight drop in wireless seasonality. Importantly, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our semiconductor business this Q2 overall to be virtually flat from a year ago, this after year-on-year reduction over the last 4 quarters. 
We -- on infrastructure software revenues, we expect that to sustain on a sequential basis as we focus on -- as we continue to focus on completing the Symantec integration process. So to put it in perspective, shipments today, in addition to orders on hand, give us the confidence in our ability to achieve this focus. 
So finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, let me address our wireless business, especially given all the speculation in the press following our last quarterly call. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that continuing to invest in and operate our wireless assets will create the most value for our business and for our shareholders. We're now more closely and strategically aligned with our largest smartphone customer as a result of our recent multiyear supply agreements and look forward to the continued success of our wireless franchises. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Consolidated net revenue for the first quarter was $5.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion and represented 72% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.7 billion and represented 28% of revenue. This was up 19% year-over-year and up 39% quarter-over-quarter. 
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.19 billion and include approximately $80 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the course of the year. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.08 billion and represented 52.6% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.27 billion and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $146 million of depreciation. I would also note that we accrued $248 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $131 million of cash restructuring integration payments in the quarter. 
We spent $108 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 37.8% of revenue or $2.21 billion. In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We paid $169 million in withholding taxes to investing of employment equity, resulting in elimination of 0.5 million AVGO shares. Finally, we ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of cash, $44.7 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares for the quarter. 
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Hock discussed, we expect net revenue to be $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $3.135 billion or 55% of net revenue, with a slight drop in revenue, partially offset by the lower operating expense. As you would expect us to do, we run various downside recessionary scenarios with respect to our cash flow outlook and ability to maintain our liquidity, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. Given our high gross margin profile and our somewhat variable operating expense structure, we believe we are able to maintain EBITDA margins comfortably north of 50% even in these downside scenarios. With this as a backdrop, we are quite comfortable with the current dividend and our ability to generate excess cash beyond the dividend throughout the fiscal year. As a result, our capital allocation plan for the year remains unchanged. We plan to pay out approximately $5.5 billion in cash dividend to common and preferred shareholders and expect to pay down $4 billion of debt. Given the high level of uncertainty today, we are currently focused on maintaining higher-than-normal levels of liquidity and currently plan to do the debt paydown in the second half of the year or once visibility starts to improve. That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

I mean, as we sit here right now, and obviously, you're trying not to be disingenuous about how we answer this question. But we haven't seen any significant or meaningful impact, but that could reflect the fact that most of all our businesses are related to enterprises and infrastructure as opposed to consumer base. And as we know, the pandemic of COVID-19 is, obviously, thing the people, the individual, the consumer. So we have that level of buffer before we see it. And we recognize that. We also recognize the fact that probably some areas would behave differently from other areas in a sense that we see as part of social distancing that more and more people, a lot of people work from home, which basically implies they not only work from home, they stay home and play from home, which means consumption of Internet cloud increases. So hyper cloud spending, I would see to probably not be pulled back or scaled back, possibly might even improve or such. 
On the other side, over time, as consumer spending drops as we all expect to at least over -- on a temporary basis. Confidence level among businesses, enterprises might erode, as I indicated in my notes, which might basically delay or push out spending by enterprises. While cloud spending goes up. So there's puts and takes. But again, this is all speculation, and I want to put it down this way because we have not seen either thing -- either scenarios happen as yet."

So that's $9.5 billion of cash usage, which I think is higher than the $9 billion free cash flow that you had outlined in the last call for fiscal '20. So that definitely suggests strong free cash flow generation for this year. So I'm just trying to look at those data points and see what are the assumptions you have for the second half of this year, both from a sales and a free cash flow generation perspective."

Because then the bottom line falls through with us very, very easily, to answer your question. On -- and as Tom indicated, as we look at the full year, we could draw various possibilities, various scenarios. We could. In our current guidance, I'm not suggesting for a second, might even show up or close to show up. Problem is, frankly, as I indicated, we don't know. We don't know because we don't -- we're trying to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our ecosystem and that this is still a very early stage in the whole process. But what we've seen so far is what happened in China, Asia, obviously. And that hit that line big, but -- so it could come from 2 parts, demand and supply chain. 
What we saw in the supply chain was not much impact, partly because a lot of supply chain contract manufacturing and all that was not in China. Part of it was, but there was also inventory in the pipeline pre-COVID-19, so that kept supply chain going. So our supply chain has not been impacted to any meaningful level. 
On the demand side, there was a slowdown. There has also been some level of recovery since then in China as this -- as the pandemic in China starts to subside somewhat. Now having said that, we're looking over at the U.S., Europe now, and we're seeing that going into its full-blown glory. Can we extrapolate what we see in China over here? To be honest, we don't know. And so if you want to look at one side -- to one possible downside, and we plan -- we have downplay it. You could say the revenues could drop, say, [indiscernible] 5% to 10% from our $25 billion original forecast. And as Tom indicated -- and I'll let Tom elaborate a bit more -- what we're seeing is because of a high margin products and revenues, and to some extent, a variable OpEx, operating expense levels, we expect our EBITDA percentage, EBITDA percentage of revenue to still be comfortably over 50%."

I think if you look at the Q2 levels, it's a seasonally down quarter traditionally. And we work off of that as a baseline, you're right, we all would have expected revenues to seasonally be up in the second half. There's some onetime drivers associated with that, but there's also generally an uptick in the back half. We run a lot of different scenarios, as you would expect we would. Even if you assume depressed levels where we're flattish off of the Q2 number, I mean, keep in mind, in Q2, we're going to generate on the order of $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Interest rates have come down dramatically. We have a lot of floating rate debt. That's helping us. We have a variable compensation structure here, as Hock is articulating, that helps us. And so if you want to paint that kind of scenario, those are things we have to do, especially given our capital structure, we're still going to generate on order -- the amount of free cash flow that you were just describing. We haven't guided a specific number because I think the visibility continues to get worse, and we don't want to get out in front of what could be, obviously, a very challenging environment. But needless to say, we're paying $5.5 billion in the form of dividends, including the preferred. It gives us a tremendous amount of headroom. I think it's only prudent, as I said, to keep ample amount of liquidity as we sit here today, but it's at least our expectation, especially if we're going to be running at these levels, let alone show any improvement that we would continue on and continue to pay down the debt we said we were going to in the second half. So we'll continue to watch it. And as visibility improves, we'll act accordingly."

I think on the leverage levels, what we had gone into the year looking at maintaining roughly 3 to 3.5x leverage on a pro forma basis with Symantec. That included the pro forma contribution from an EBITDA perspective, over $1 billion from Symantec as well as some debt paydown by the end of the year. So that largely is intact, frankly. I think, as you also know, we came off of a cyclical downturn in semis last year. And at least through the first half, as we discussed, we're -- frankly, we're flat to -- if anything, on the semi side and CA actually is up. 
So from an EBITDA standpoint, it would take quite a bit of a drop in the organic business, very meaningful drop actually where EBITDA would actually be down year-over-year, especially given the Symantec contribution. So I think from a leverage level standpoint and as it relates to our rating profile, we feel pretty comfortable. 
On the dividend, I think it's premature. Obviously, we talked about the cash flows. We've discussed sort of where cash flows are in the first half, and you're running near $5 [ million ] second half. Even in some downside scenarios, I think are going to hold up reasonably well. And so when you look at the cash flow performance, even on a relative basis to last year when you include restructuring costs, we're actually going to be up as well in that downside scenario. So things would have to get a lot worse where we'd be looking at changing our dividend policy. In fact, I think what I would tell you is we usually look at the fundamentals of the business and are any of these businesses changing meaningfully relative to the fundamentals. We'll see that, of course. And so we're pretty committed to the dividend, as you can expect. And the cash flows are there to support that."

The business, the semiconductor business I pointed out what -- has been nicely recovering. Still, in some ways, if you look at numbers, Q1 and Q2, as we say, it reflects that. It is recovering. In fact, Q4 last year, if you take the semiconductor solutions segment, year-on-year was down 7% Q4 '19. Q1 just [indiscernible]. And '20, we're down 4%. And our guidance now for Q2 '20 is virtually flat from a year ago. You see that recovery. Now it's still gradual, and we have hope the second half to be accelerated for the reasons you mentioned about, which is data center spending, which had been more muted before starting to accelerate. And you would say that, that should have limited -- should be impacted on a more limited indirect basis by COVID-19. The only thing I'll turn to you is we don't know for sure.

Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which",804,"Well, thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which I will provide an update on the current environment and outlook.
Consolidated net revenue for first quarter was $5.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-over-year. But collectively, demand for our networking, broadband and storage products continue to recover, growing 6% year-over-year. However, as expected, wireless products were down sharply year-on-year due to the -- an architectural change in touch sensing as we explained.
Our infrastructure software segment performed largely as expected. Brocade recovered from the bottom of 2019 and continue to stabilize very well. CA had a record quarter under Broadcom delivering approximately $880 million of revenue or a 5% growth year-over-year.
Finally, in this first quarter of integrating Symantec onto our platform and taking into account the impact of purchase accounting, we had revenue of approximately $400 million, which we expect will step up as the year progresses. Now these first quarter results also exclude the Managed Security Services business, which we are divesting to Accenture.
Now let me turn to our current thinking on the full year. Let me begin by putting into context how we initially came to our prior full year 2020 guidance. It was based on 2 primary drivers. On the infrastructure software side, we added Symantec, which, in the first year, we expect to do $1.8 billion. Combined with Brocade, which is on its way back to a normalized run rate, and CA, which is growing, we felt good about $7 billion from the software segment in 2020.
Now in semiconductors. 2018 was a strong year, up high single digits. However, with softening demand industry-wide, 2019 became challenging and was down high single digits, bottoming out in the second half of the year. So when we gave our 2020 guidance last quarter, it reflected a projected recovery from that bottom. We expected the recovery would be more gradual in the first half of 2020, which we have been seeing and then accelerate in the second half of 2020. Our confidence in that acceleration was driven by the anticipated launch of 5G phones late in the year and expected strong data center spending from enterprise and hyper cloud customers.
So now let's talk about the impact of COVID-19 on that outlook. As I sit here today, I have not yet seen a meaningful impact on bookings, and certainly, the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact. However, there is no doubt COVID-19 has created a high level of uncertainty, which we can help but think is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular, in the second half of the fiscal year. But frankly, visibility is bad, and confidence continue to erode. So as a result, we believe it is only prudent that we withdraw our annual guidance until such time that visibility returns to pre-COVID-19 levels.
One more point though before I move on. Keep in mind, through all this cyclicality and uncertainty, given the high degree of recurring revenue based on multiyear contracts, any uncertainty around infrastructure software revenue is likely to be very much more muted. Also, in light of the unique environment we are in, we thought it makes sense at this time to provide more color on near-term expectations, which we have better visibility. We expect our second quarter revenue to be $5.7 billion, which reflects a typical sequential drop, slight drop in wireless seasonality. Importantly, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our semiconductor business this Q2 overall to be virtually flat from a year ago, this after year-on-year reduction over the last 4 quarters.
We -- on infrastructure software revenues, we expect that to sustain on a sequential basis as we focus on -- as we continue to focus on completing the Symantec integration process. So to put it in perspective, shipments to date in addition to orders on hand give us the confidence in our ability to achieve this forecast. 
So finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, let me address our wireless business, especially given all the speculation in the press following our last quarterly call. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that continuing to invest in and operate our wireless assets will create the most value for our business and for our shareholders. We're now more closely and strategically aligned with our largest smartphone customer as a result of our recent multiyear supply agreements and look forward to the continued success of our wireless franchises.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Operating expenses were $1.19 billion and include approximately $80 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the course of the year. Operating income from continuing operation was $3.08 billion and represented 52.6% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.27 billion and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $146 million of depreciation. I would also note that we accrued $248 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $131 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter.
We spent $108 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 37.8% of revenue or $2.21 billion. In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We paid $169 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employment equity resulting in elimination of 0.5 million AVGO shares. Finally, we ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of cash, $44.7 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares for the quarter.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Hock discussed, we expect net revenue to be $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $3.135 billion or 55% of net revenue with a slight drop in revenue partially offset by the lower operating expense.
As you would expect us to do, we run various downside recessionary scenarios with respect to our cash flow outlook and ability to maintain our liquidity, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. Given our high gross margin profile and our somewhat variable operating expense structure, we believe we are able to maintain EBITDA margins comfortably north of 50% even in these downside scenarios. With this as a backdrop, we are quite comfortable with the current dividend and our ability to generate excess cash beyond the dividend throughout the fiscal year.
As a result, our capital allocation plan for the year remains unchanged. We plan to pay out approximately $5.5 billion in cash dividend to common and preferred shareholders and expect to pay down $4 billion of debt. Given the high level of uncertainty today, we are currently focused on maintaining higher-than-normal levels of liquidity and currently plan to do the debt paydown in the second half of the year or once visibility starts to improve.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

I mean, as we sit here right now -- and obviously you're trying not to be disingenuous about how we answer this question, but we haven't seen any significant or meaningful impact. But that could reflect the fact that most of all our businesses are related to enterprises and infrastructure as opposed to consumer base. And as we know, the pandemic of COVID-19 is obviously thing -- the people, the individual, the consumer. So we have that level of buffer before we see it, and we recognize that. We also recognize the fact that probably some areas would behave differently from other areas in a sense that we see as part of social distancing that more and more people, a lot of people work from home, which basically implies they not only work from home. They stay home and play from home, which means consumption of Internet cloud increases. So hyper cloud spending, I would see to probably not be pulled back or scaled back, possibly might even improve or such.
On the other side, over time, as consumer spending drops as we all expect to at least over -- on a temporary basis, confidence level among businesses, enterprises might erode, as I indicated in my notes, which might basically delay or push out spending by enterprises, while cloud spending goes up. So there's puts and takes. But again, this all be all speculation, and I want to put it down this way because we have not seen either thing -- either scenarios happen as yet."

On -- and as Tom indicated, as we look at the full year, we could draw various possibilities, various scenarios. We could. In our current guidance, I'm not suggesting for a second might even show up or close to show up. Problem is, frankly, as I indicated, we don't know. We don't know because we don't -- we're trying to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our ecosystem and that this is still a very early stage in the whole process. But what we've seen so far is what happened in China, Asia, obviously. And that hit badly, big but -- so it could come from 2 parts, demand and supply chain.
What we saw in the supply chain was not much impact, partly because a lot of supply chain contract manufacturing and all that was not in China. Part of it was, but there was also inventory in the pipeline pre-COVID-19, so that kept supply chain going. So our supply chain has not been impacted to any meaningful level.
On the demand side, there was slowdown. There has also been some level of recovery since then in China as this -- as the pandemic in China starts to subside somewhat. Now having said that, we're looking over at the U.S., Europe now, and we're seeing that going into its full-blown glory. Can we extrapolate what we see in China over here? To be honest, we don't know. And so if you want to look at one right -- one possible downside, and we plan -- we have done plenty of it, you could say the revenues could drop, say, 10% -- 5% to 10% from our $25 billion original forecast. And as Tom indicated, and I'll let Tom elaborate a bit more, what we're seeing is because of our high-margin products and revenues and to some extent, our variable OpEx, operating expense levels, we expect our EBITDA percentage, EBITDA percentage of revenue to still be comfortably over 50%."

I think if you look at the Q2 levels, it's a seasonally down quarter traditionally. And if we work off of that as a baseline, you're right, we all would have expected revenues to seasonally be up in the second half. There are some onetime drivers associated with that, but there's also generally an uptick in the back half. We run a lot of different scenarios as you'd expect we would. Even if you assume depressed levels where we're flattish off of the Q2 number, I mean keep in mind, in Q2, we're going to generate on the order of $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Interest rates have come down dramatically. We have a lot of floating rate debt. That's helping us. We have a variable compensation structure here as Hock was articulating. That helps us.
And so if you want to paint that kind of scenario, those are things we have to do, especially given our capital structure, we're still going to generate on order the amount of free cash flow that you were just describing. And we haven't guided a specific number because I think the visibility continues to get worse, and we don't want to get out in front of what could be obviously a very challenging environment. But needless to say, we're paying $5.5 billion in the form of dividends, including the preferred. It gives us a tremendous amount of headroom. I think it's only prudent, as I said, to keep ample amount of liquidity as we sit here today, but it's at least our expectation, especially if we're going to be running at these levels, let alone show any improvement that we would continue on and continue to pay down the debt we said we were going to in the second half. So we'll continue to watch it, and as visibility improves, we'll act accordingly."

I think on the leverage levels, what we had gone into the year looking at was maintaining roughly 3 to 3.5x leverage on a pro forma basis with Symantec. That included the pro forma contribution from an EBITDA perspective, over $1 billion from Symantec as well as some debt paydown by the end of the year. So that largely is intact, frankly. I think, as you also know, we came off of a cyclical downturn in semis last year and at least through the first half. As we discussed, we're -- frankly, we're flat to -- if anything, on the semi side and CA actually is up.
So from an EBITDA standpoint, it would take quite a bit of a drop in the organic business, very meaningful drop actually where EBITDA would actually be down year-over-year, especially given the Symantec contribution. So I think from a leverage level standpoint and as it relates to our rating profile, we feel pretty comfortable.
On the dividend, I think it's premature. Obviously, we talked about the cash flows. We've discussed sort of where cash flows are in the first half, and we're running near $5 billion second half. Even in some downside scenarios, I think are going to hold up reasonably well. And so when you look at the cash flow performance even on a relative basis to last year when you include restructuring costs, we're actually going to be up as well in that downside scenario. So things would have to get a lot worse where we'd be looking at changing our dividend policy. In fact, I think what I would tell you is we usually look at the fundamentals of the business and are any of these businesses changing meaningfully relative to the fundamentals. We'd see that of course. And so we're pretty committed to the dividend as you can expect, and the cash flows are there to support that."

Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which",804,"Well, thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which I will provide an update on the current environment and outlook.
Consolidated net revenue for first quarter was $5.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-over-year. But collectively, demand for our networking, broadband and storage products continue to recover, growing 6% year-over-year. However, as expected, wireless products were down sharply year-on-year due to the -- an architectural change in touch sensing as we explained.
Our infrastructure software segment performed largely as expected. Brocade recovered from the bottom of 2019 and continue to stabilize very well. CA had a record quarter under Broadcom delivering approximately $880 million of revenue or a 5% growth year-over-year.
Finally, in this first quarter of integrating Symantec onto our platform and taking into account the impact of purchase accounting, we had revenue of approximately $400 million, which we expect will step up as the year progresses. Now these first quarter results also exclude the Managed Security Services business, which we are divesting to Accenture.
Now let me turn to our current thinking on the full year. Let me begin by putting into context how we initially came to our prior full year 2020 guidance. It was based on 2 primary drivers. On the infrastructure software side, we added Symantec, which, in the first year, we expect to do $1.8 billion. Combined with Brocade, which is on its way back to a normalized run rate, and CA, which is growing, we felt good about $7 billion from the software segment in 2020.
Now in semiconductors. 2018 was a strong year, up high single digits. However, with softening demand industry-wide, 2019 became challenging and was down high single digits, bottoming out in the second half of the year. So when we gave our 2020 guidance last quarter, it reflected a projected recovery from that bottom. We expected the recovery would be more gradual in the first half of 2020, which we have been seeing and then accelerate in the second half of 2020. Our confidence in that acceleration was driven by the anticipated launch of 5G phones late in the year and expected strong data center spending from enterprise and hyper cloud customers.
So now let's talk about the impact of COVID-19 on that outlook. As I sit here today, I have not yet seen a meaningful impact on bookings, and certainly, the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact. However, there is no doubt COVID-19 has created a high level of uncertainty, which we can help but think is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular, in the second half of the fiscal year. But frankly, visibility is bad, and confidence continue to erode. So as a result, we believe it is only prudent that we withdraw our annual guidance until such time that visibility returns to pre-COVID-19 levels.
One more point though before I move on. Keep in mind, through all this cyclicality and uncertainty, given the high degree of recurring revenue based on multiyear contracts, any uncertainty around infrastructure software revenue is likely to be very much more muted. Also, in light of the unique environment we are in, we thought it makes sense at this time to provide more color on near-term expectations, which we have better visibility. We expect our second quarter revenue to be $5.7 billion, which reflects a typical sequential drop, slight drop in wireless seasonality. Importantly, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our semiconductor business this Q2 overall to be virtually flat from a year ago, this after year-on-year reduction over the last 4 quarters.
We -- on infrastructure software revenues, we expect that to sustain on a sequential basis as we focus on -- as we continue to focus on completing the Symantec integration process. So to put it in perspective, shipments to date in addition to orders on hand give us the confidence in our ability to achieve this forecast. 
So finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, let me address our wireless business, especially given all the speculation in the press following our last quarterly call. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that continuing to invest in and operate our wireless assets will create the most value for our business and for our shareholders. We're now more closely and strategically aligned with our largest smartphone customer as a result of our recent multiyear supply agreements and look forward to the continued success of our wireless franchises.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion and represented 72% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.7 billion and represented 28% of revenue. This was up 19% year-over-year and up 39% quarter-over-quarter.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.19 billion and include approximately $80 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the course of the year. Operating income from continuing operation was $3.08 billion and represented 52.6% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.27 billion and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $146 million of depreciation. I would also note that we accrued $248 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $131 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter.
We spent $108 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 37.8% of revenue or $2.21 billion. In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We paid $169 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employment equity resulting in elimination of 0.5 million AVGO shares. Finally, we ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of cash, $44.7 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares for the quarter.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Hock discussed, we expect net revenue to be $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $3.135 billion or 55% of net revenue with a slight drop in revenue partially offset by the lower operating expense.
As you would expect us to do, we run various downside recessionary scenarios with respect to our cash flow outlook and ability to maintain our liquidity, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. Given our high gross margin profile and our somewhat variable operating expense structure, we believe we are able to maintain EBITDA margins comfortably north of 50% even in these downside scenarios. With this as a backdrop, we are quite comfortable with the current dividend and our ability to generate excess cash beyond the dividend throughout the fiscal year.
As a result, our capital allocation plan for the year remains unchanged. We plan to pay out approximately $5.5 billion in cash dividend to common and preferred shareholders and expect to pay down $4 billion of debt. Given the high level of uncertainty today, we are currently focused on maintaining higher-than-normal levels of liquidity and currently plan to do the debt paydown in the second half of the year or once visibility starts to improve.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

I mean, as we sit here right now -- and obviously you're trying not to be disingenuous about how we answer this question, but we haven't seen any significant or meaningful impact. But that could reflect the fact that most of all our businesses are related to enterprises and infrastructure as opposed to consumer base. And as we know, the pandemic of COVID-19 is obviously thing -- the people, the individual, the consumer. So we have that level of buffer before we see it, and we recognize that. We also recognize the fact that probably some areas would behave differently from other areas in a sense that we see as part of social distancing that more and more people, a lot of people work from home, which basically implies they not only work from home. They stay home and play from home, which means consumption of Internet cloud increases. So hyper cloud spending, I would see to probably not be pulled back or scaled back, possibly might even improve or such.
On the other side, over time, as consumer spending drops as we all expect to at least over -- on a temporary basis, confidence level among businesses, enterprises might erode, as I indicated in my notes, which might basically delay or push out spending by enterprises, while cloud spending goes up. So there's puts and takes. But again, this all be all speculation, and I want to put it down this way because we have not seen either thing -- either scenarios happen as yet."

Because when I go back to Tom's, I think, cash flow remarks, if I got them right, I think, Tom, you said $5.5 billion in dividend payment and $4 billion in debt paydown. So that's $9.5 billion of cash usage, which I think is higher than the $9 billion free cash flow that you had outlined in the last call for fiscal '20. So that definitely suggests strong free cash flow generation for this year. So I'm just trying to look at those data points and see what are the assumptions you have for the second half of this year, both from a sales and a free cash flow generation perspective."

On -- and as Tom indicated, as we look at the full year, we could draw up various possibilities, various scenarios. We could -- in our current guidance, I'm not suggesting for a second might even show up or close to show up. Problem is, frankly, as I indicated, we don't know. We don't know because we don't -- we're trying to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our ecosystem and that this is still a very early stage in the whole process. But what we've seen so far is what happened in China, Asia, obviously. And that hit badly, big but -- so it could come from 2 parts, demand and supply chain.
What we saw in the supply chain was not much impact, partly because a lot of supply chain contract manufacturing and all that was not in China. Part of it was, but there was also inventory in the pipeline pre-COVID-19. So that kept supply chain going. So our supply chain has not been impacted to any meaningful level.
On the demand side, there was slowdown. There has also been some level of recovery since then in China as this -- as the pandemic in China starts to subside somewhat. Now having said that, we're looking over at the U.S., Europe now, and we're seeing that going into its full-blown glory. Can we extrapolate what we see in China over here? To be honest, we don't know. And so if you want to look at one right -- one possible downside, and we plan -- we have done plenty of it, you could say the revenues could drop, say, 5% to 10% from our $25 billion original forecast. And as Tom indicated, and I'll let Tom elaborate a bit more, what we're seeing is because of our high-margin products and revenues and to some extent, our variable OpEx, operating expense levels. We expect our EBITDA percentage of revenue to still be comfortably over 50%."

I think if you look at the Q2 levels, it's a seasonally down quarter traditionally. And if we work off of that as a baseline, you're right, we all would have expected revenues to seasonally be up in the second half. There are some onetime drivers associated with that, but there's also generally an uptick in the back half. We run a lot of different scenarios as you'd expect we would. Even if you assume depressed levels where we're flattish off of the Q2 number, I mean keep in mind, in Q2, we're going to generate on the order of $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Interest rates have come down dramatically. We have a lot of floating rate debt. That's helping us. We have a variable compensation structure here as Hock was articulating. That helps us.
And so if you want to paint that kind of scenario, those are things we have to do, especially given our capital structure, we're still going to generate on order the amount of free cash flow that you were just describing. And we haven't guided a specific number because I think the visibility continues to get worse, and we don't want to get out in front of what could be obviously a very challenging environment. But needless to say, we're paying $5.5 billion in the form of dividends, including the preferred. It gives us a tremendous amount of headroom. I think it's only prudent, as I said, to keep ample amount of liquidity as we sit here today, but it's at least our expectation, especially if we're going to be running at these levels, let alone show any improvement that we would continue on and continue to pay down the debt we said we were going to in the second half. So we'll continue to watch it, and as visibility improves, we'll act accordingly."

I think on the leverage levels, what we had gone into the year looking at was maintaining roughly 3 to 3.5x leverage on a pro forma basis with Symantec. And that included the pro forma contribution from an EBITDA perspective, over $1 billion from Symantec as well as some debt paydown by the end of the year. So that largely is intact, frankly. I think, as you also know, we came off of a cyclical downturn in semis last year and at least through the first half. As we discussed, we're -- frankly, we're flat to -- if anything, on the semi side. And CA actually is up.
So from an EBITDA standpoint, it would take quite a bit of a drop in the organic business, very meaningful drop actually where EBITDA would actually be down year-over-year, especially given the Symantec contribution. So I think from a leverage level standpoint and as it relates to our rating profile, we feel pretty comfortable.
On the dividend, I think it's premature. Obviously, we talked about the cash flows. We've discussed sort of where cash flows are in the first half. And we're running near $5 billion second half. Even in some downside scenarios, I think are going to hold up reasonably well. And so when you look at the cash flow performance even on a relative basis to last year when you include restructuring costs, we're actually going to be up as well in that downside scenario. So things would have to get a lot worse where we'd be looking at changing our dividend policy. In fact, I think what I would tell you is we usually look at the fundamentals of the business and are any of these businesses changing meaningfully relative to the fundamentals. We'd see that of course. And so we're pretty committed to the dividend as you can expect, and the cash flows are there to support that."

In fact, you could paint a picture that some of the COVID-19 activity in terms of social distancing would actually suggest it could improve.

Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which",804,"Well, thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. Well, it certainly was the best of times. It is now the worst of times, and we certainly live in very interesting times. So let me start by reviewing our first quarter results, after which I will provide an update on the current environment and outlook.
Consolidated net revenue for first quarter was $5.9 billion, a 1% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-over-year. But collectively, demand for our networking, broadband and storage products continue to recover, growing 6% year-over-year. However, as expected, wireless products were down sharply year-on-year due to the -- an architectural change in touch sensing as we explained.
Our infrastructure software segment performed largely as expected. Brocade recovered from the bottom of 2019 and continue to stabilize very well. CA had a record quarter under Broadcom delivering approximately $880 million of revenue or a 5% growth year-over-year.
Finally, in this first quarter of integrating Symantec onto our platform and taking into account the impact of purchase accounting, we had revenue of approximately $400 million, which we expect will step up as the year progresses. Now these first quarter results also exclude the Managed Security Services business, which we are divesting to Accenture.
Now let me turn to our current thinking on the full year. Let me begin by putting into context how we initially came to our prior full year 2020 guidance. It was based on 2 primary drivers. On the infrastructure software side, we added Symantec, which, in the first year, we expect to do $1.8 billion. Combined with Brocade, which is on its way back to a normalized run rate, and CA, which is growing, we felt good about $7 billion from the software segment in 2020.
Now in semiconductors. 2018 was a strong year, up high single digits. However, with softening demand industry-wide, 2019 became challenging and was down high single digits, bottoming out in the second half of the year. So when we gave our 2020 guidance last quarter, it reflected a projected recovery from that bottom. We expected the recovery would be more gradual in the first half of 2020, which we have been seeing and then accelerate in the second half of 2020. Our confidence in that acceleration was driven by the anticipated launch of 5G phones late in the year and expected strong data center spending from enterprise and hyper cloud customers.
So now let's talk about the impact of COVID-19 on that outlook. As I sit here today, I have not yet seen a meaningful impact on bookings, and certainly, the fundamentals of the business remain very much intact. However, there is no doubt COVID-19 has created a high level of uncertainty, which we can help but think is going to have an impact on our semiconductor business, in particular, in the second half of the fiscal year. But frankly, visibility is bad, and confidence continue to erode. So as a result, we believe it is only prudent that we withdraw our annual guidance until such time that visibility returns to pre-COVID-19 levels.
One more point though before I move on. Keep in mind, through all this cyclicality and uncertainty, given the high degree of recurring revenue based on multiyear contracts, any uncertainty around infrastructure software revenue is likely to be very much more muted. Also, in light of the unique environment we are in, we thought it makes sense at this time to provide more color on near-term expectations, which we have better visibility. We expect our second quarter revenue to be $5.7 billion, which reflects a typical sequential drop, slight drop in wireless seasonality. Importantly, on a year-on-year basis, we expect our semiconductor business this Q2 overall to be virtually flat from a year ago, this after year-on-year reduction over the last 4 quarters.
We -- on infrastructure software revenues, we expect that to sustain on a sequential basis as we focus on -- as we continue to focus on completing the Symantec integration process. So to put it in perspective, shipments to date in addition to orders on hand give us the confidence in our ability to achieve this forecast. 
So finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, let me address our wireless business, especially given all the speculation in the press following our last quarterly call. After careful consideration, we have come to the conclusion that continuing to invest in and operate our wireless assets will create the most value for our business and for our shareholders. We're now more closely and strategically aligned with our largest smartphone customer as a result of our recent multiyear supply agreements and look forward to the continued success of our wireless franchises.
Now let me turn the call over to Tom."

Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion and represented 72% of our total revenue this quarter. This was down 4% year-on-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.7 billion and represented 28% of revenue. This was up 19% year-over-year and up 39% quarter-over-quarter.
Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Operating expenses were $1.19 billion and include approximately $80 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the course of the year. Operating income from continuing operation was $3.08 billion and represented 52.6% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.27 billion and represented 55.7% of net revenue. This figure excludes $146 million of depreciation. I would also note that we accrued $248 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $131 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in the quarter.
We spent $108 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 37.8% of revenue or $2.21 billion. In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our common stockholders, including $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We paid $169 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employment equity resulting in elimination of 0.5 million AVGO shares. Finally, we ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of cash, $44.7 billion of total debt, 399 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares for the quarter.
Now let me turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As Hock discussed, we expect net revenue to be $5.7 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $3.135 billion or 55% of net revenue with a slight drop in revenue partially offset by the lower operating expense.
As you would expect us to do, we run various downside recessionary scenarios with respect to our cash flow outlook and ability to maintain our liquidity, service our debt and return capital to our shareholders. Given our high gross margin profile and our somewhat variable operating expense structure, we believe we are able to maintain EBITDA margins comfortably north of 50% even in these downside scenarios. With this as a backdrop, we are quite comfortable with the current dividend and our ability to generate excess cash beyond the dividend throughout the fiscal year.
As a result, our capital allocation plan for the year remains unchanged. We plan to pay out approximately $5.5 billion in cash dividend to common and preferred shareholders and expect to pay down $4 billion of debt. Given the high level of uncertainty today, we are currently focused on maintaining higher-than-normal levels of liquidity and currently plan to do the debt paydown in the second half of the year or once visibility starts to improve.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

I mean as we sit here right now -- and obviously you're trying not to be disingenuous about how we answer this question, but we haven't seen any significant or meaningful impact. But that could reflect the fact that most of all our businesses are related to enterprises and infrastructure as opposed to consumer base. And as we know, the pandemic of COVID-19 is obviously thing -- the people, the individual, the consumer. So we have that level of buffer before we see it, and we recognize that. We also recognize the fact that probably some areas would behave differently from other areas in a sense that we see as part of social distancing that more and more people, a lot of people work from home, which basically implies they not only work from home. They stay home and play from home, which means consumption of Internet cloud increases. So hyper cloud spending, I would see to probably not be pulled back or scaled back, possibly might even improve or such.
On the other side, over time, as consumer spending drops as we all expect to at least over -- on a temporary basis, confidence level among businesses, enterprises might erode, as I indicated in my notes, which might basically delay or push out spending by enterprises, while cloud spending goes up. So there's puts and takes. But again, this all be all speculation, and I want to put it down this way because we have not seen either thing -- either scenarios happen as yet."

On -- and as Tom indicated, as we look at the full year, we could draw up various possibilities, various scenarios. We could -- in our current guidance, I'm not suggesting for a second might even show up or close to show up. Problem is, frankly, as I indicated, we don't know. We don't know because we don't -- we're trying to understand the impact of COVID-19 on our ecosystem and that this is still a very early stage in the whole process. But what we've seen so far is what happened in China, Asia, obviously. And that hit badly, big but -- so it could come from 2 parts, demand and supply chain.
What we saw in the supply chain was not much impact, partly because a lot of supply chain contract manufacturing and all that was not in China. Part of it was, but there was also inventory in the pipeline pre-COVID-19. So that kept supply chain going. So our supply chain has not been impacted to any meaningful level.
On the demand side, there was slowdown. There has also been some level of recovery since then in China as this -- as the pandemic in China starts to subside somewhat. Now having said that, we're looking over at the U.S., Europe now, and we're seeing that going into its full-blown glory. Can we extrapolate what we see in China over here? To be honest, we don't know. And so if you want to look at one right -- one possible downside, and we plan -- we have done plenty of it, you could say the revenues could drop, say, 5% to 10% from our $25 billion original forecast. And as Tom indicated, and I'll let Tom elaborate a bit more, what we're seeing is because of our high-margin products and revenues and to some extent, our variable OpEx, operating expense levels. We expect our EBITDA percentage of revenue to still be comfortably over 50%."

And if we work off of that as a baseline, you're right, we all would have expected revenues to seasonally be up in the second half. There are some onetime drivers associated with that, but there's also generally an uptick in the back half. We run a lot of different scenarios as you'd expect we would. Even if you assume depressed levels where we're flattish off of the Q2 number, I mean keep in mind, in Q2, we're going to generate on the order of $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Interest rates have come down dramatically. We have a lot of floating rate debt. That's helping us. We have a variable compensation structure here as Hock was articulating. That helps us.
And so if you want to paint that kind of scenario, those are things we have to do, especially given our capital structure, we're still going to generate on order the amount of free cash flow that you were just describing. And we haven't guided a specific number because I think the visibility continues to get worse, and we don't want to get out in front of what could be obviously a very challenging environment. But needless to say, we're paying $5.5 billion in the form of dividends, including the preferred. It gives us a tremendous amount of headroom. I think it's only prudent, as I said, to keep ample amount of liquidity as we sit here today, but it's at least our expectation, especially if we're going to be running at these levels, let alone show any improvement that we would continue on and continue to pay down the debt we said we were going to in the second half.

I think on the leverage levels, what we had gone into the year looking at was maintaining roughly 3 to 3.5x leverage on a pro forma basis with Symantec. And that included the pro forma contribution from an EBITDA perspective, over $1 billion from Symantec as well as some debt paydown by the end of the year. So that largely is intact, frankly. I think as you also know, we came off of a cyclical downturn in semis last year and at least through the first half. As we discussed, we're -- frankly, we're flat to -- if anything, on the semi side. And CA actually is up.
So from an EBITDA standpoint, it would take quite a bit of a drop in the organic business, very meaningful drop actually where EBITDA would actually be down year-over-year, especially given the Symantec contribution. So I think from a leverage level standpoint and as it relates to our rating profile, we feel pretty comfortable.
On the dividend, I think it's premature. Obviously, we talked about the cash flows. We've discussed sort of where cash flows are in the first half. And we're running near $5 billion second half. Even in some downside scenarios, I think are going to hold up reasonably well. And so when you look at the cash flow performance even on a relative basis to last year when you include restructuring costs, we're actually going to be up as well in that downside scenario. So things would have to get a lot worse where we'd be looking at changing our dividend policy. In fact, I think what I would tell you is we usually look at the fundamentals of the business and are any of these businesses changing meaningfully relative to the fundamentals. We'd see that of course. And so we're pretty committed to the dividend as you can expect, and the cash flows are there to support that."

The business, the semiconductor business I pointed out had -- was -- has been nicely recovering. Still, in some ways, if you look at numbers, Q1 and Q2, as we say, it reflects that. It's been -- it is recovering. In fact, Q4 last year, if you take the semiconductor solutions segment, year-on-year was down 7% Q4 '19. Q1 just passed, for '20, we're down 4%. And our guidance now for Q2 '20 is virtually flat from a year ago. You see that recovery. Now it's still gradual, and we had hoped the second half to be accelerated for the reasons you mentioned above, which is data center spending, which had been more muted before starting to accelerate. And you would say that, that should have limited -- should be impacted on a more limited indirect basis by COVID-19. 
The only thing I'll turn to you is we don't know for sure. Hence, our -- I would say, we put in a very prudent position. We don't know. But you think it's the consumer that had hit less the infrastructure, data centers, but this -- the things that are going on was still very unclear. Visibility on how people behave, our enterprises, our cloud guys would change their spending behavior, still not very clear. But pre-COVID-19, you're right.

Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide our quarterly results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge and saying all of the health care professionals and essential workers on the front lines who are showing incredible courage during these unprecedented times. I speak for all of Broadcom when I say we are very grateful for your work. I also especially want to thank our team of more than 20,000 employees working all over the world to keep our business running. I'm proud of their tireless efforts to preserve and protect our enterprise. Now more than ever, our customers and communities are counting on us to continue to deliver the essential technologies that enable the continuity of functions critical to daily life. 
So now let me turn to our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter. 
We delivered second quarter net revenue of $5.7 billion, very much in line with our guidance, down 2% sequentially, up 4% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4 billion, declining 2% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, which, of course, includes contribution from Symantec. On a sequential basis, semiconductors were down 4%, while software was up 3%. 
So with on to more color, starting with semiconductors. We face a very interesting demand environment in the midst of a challenging supply chain ecosystem. Let me provide more color on various semiconductor end markets, beginning with networking. Q2 reflected an expected recovery and was up 11% sequentially. Demand was healthy as we began to ramp our next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products at our various cloud customers and in network routing, Jericho 2 at our telco customers. This steady recovery, which we saw in Q2, is now turning into a demand surge in Q3 as we are seeing strength for existing generation products in addition to this next-generation range. We are also seeing a strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips for a lead cloud customer. In server storage connectivity, we note a similar situation from a 14% sequential revenue decline in Q2. Demand in Q3 has turned around and is accelerating. Demand -- sorry, demand from enterprise customers for array data protection controllers has recovered and is showing considerable strength. Demand from cloud service providers for our PCI Express switches that drive solid-state memory and AI applications has been particularly strong. 
Turning on to broadband, which was flat sequentially in Q2. We expect approximately 10% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter in Q3 driven by strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation excess gateways, not only from enterprises, but also from telcos and other service providers. We're also seeing increased demand for broadband DSL and PON and next-generation cable DOCSIS 3.1. That being said, we expect this to be partially offset by a sharp decline in video, particularly in satellite set-top boxes given the current constraints on live sporting events. 
Then moving on to wireless. Wireless saw typical seasonality in Q2, was down 14% sequentially, much like last year. In Q3, we would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer. However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter. So accordingly, we expect our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially as it was down in Q2. 
Turning last to industrial. We began to see recovery in Q2, and revenue was up 13% sequentially, consistent with recovery in resales to end market. Even as we expect resales in Q3 to be flat, given the current market uncertainty arising from the current -- the COVID-19 pandemic, we are aggressively moving to bring down channel inventory globally, especially in Europe and Japan. As a result, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in recognized shipping revenue in the third quarter. I would note, resales in Asia Pacific, in particular China, are expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, while other regions -- all other regions are expected to be down. So that's the demand picture. 
Now on the supply chain side, we have experienced and continue to do so, some challenges, some of which are unique to us. Lead times, especially in leading-edge processes, have extended and are running at historical highs. Coupled with this, we have significant test capacity, repositioned significant test capacity in Malaysia, where we also have a centralized warehouse. And this is a location, which has experienced intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns and significant logistical delays. Bottom line, in Q3, we really have much more demand than we can supply. And this may very well continue beyond Q3. 
In summary, we clearly see significant puts and takes. On the positive side, a surge of demand in networking, storage and broadband. On the negative side, supply chain constraints and a product cycle delay in wireless. Therefore, we forecast our semiconductor solution revenue to be up 3% sequentially, but only down 5% year-on-year for the third quarter despite the major product cycle delay in wireless. 
Right, now turning to software. CA was up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Bookings in our core accounts grew double digits annually, which was offset by the expected reduction in services revenue. Symantec grew 2% sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. After 2 quarters, we have successfully integrated Symantec onto the Broadcom platform and have largely completed the transition. As mentioned, bookings in our core accounts are growing and more than offsetting the transition out of smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. While Brocade was down 21% year-on-year, it was up 11% sequentially in Q2 and was -- that was the third quarter in a row of sequential growth for Brocade following the Q3 bottom last year. 
Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect revenues from CA and Symantec, of course, to sustain on a sequential basis. However, very consistent with our distribution strategy in semiconductors, we are reducing channel inventory significantly for Brocade and expect Brocade revenue will be down significantly quarter-on-quarter in Q3. So as a result, we expect revenue from the software segment to be down approximately 7% sequentially in the third quarter. So in sum, we expect our consolidated third quarter net revenue to be $5.75 billion, roughly flat from Q2. This reflects a 3% sequential projected revenue increase in semiconductors and a 7% sequential expected revenue decline in software. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. 
First, on the P&L. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and relatively flat with Q1, but up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. The increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove the increase. Operating income from continuing operations was $3 billion and represented 53% of net revenue. Operating margins were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter But down year-on-year by approximately 70 basis points, primarily due to the stranded cost for Symantec we carried in the quarter. In fact, operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which was down $28 million compared to Q1, but still included approximately $35 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the remainder of the year. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 56% of net revenue. This figure excludes $147 million of depreciation. 
Looking at cash flow. We had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 20% year-on-year. Collections were quite strong, and it's worth noting that our software businesses are seasonal, with December and to a lesser extent, March being particularly strong bookings months. As a result, our fiscal Q2 is the peak collections period for software. 
In addition, we strictly managed working capital to improve liquidity, but also out of an abundance of caution given the continuing lack of visibility. Notably, we moved most of our business to build-to-order during the quarter and are continuing to operate this way. However, the downside to our conservative approach is our ability to respond to short lead time orders is very limited. Overall, we are going to continue to operate and plan for challenging conditions going forward given the uncertain environment. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $219 million in withholding taxes due to our vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 900,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 402 million outstanding common shares and 452 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 452 million in Q3. 
On the financing and investing front, we derisked our balance sheet with over $18 billion of debt refinancing, including $2 billion of commercial paper. This allowed us to push out average debt maturities to 6 years from 4 years while our average cost of debt increased by just [ above ] 50 basis points. Note, these figures are inclusive of the $8 billion financing and $3.9 billion, excuse me, exchange offering that we executed in the first month of our third fiscal quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and currently have $14.2 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. Note, we did draw down $3 billion on our revolver earlier in the quarter, all of which we have repaid as part of our refinancing activity. We ended the quarter with $45.8 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. 
In closing, given our strong free cash flow generation, healthy balance sheet and enhanced liquidity position, we remain committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate this uncertain environment. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call to questions."

We believe, because of product cycle delays, the trough for our fiscal year will be Q3, this coming quarter. And that's what we reflected -- in our forecast, that's reflected in the number in the way we are guiding Q3. Nothing has changed in terms of designs. Nothing has changed in terms of the content you indicated. And you're right, the content has been up for 5G phones, over 30%, way over 30%, more closer to 40% from where we were last year.

So let me spend a few minutes to respond to them and give you a little more color. We now have CA under our belt, and CA comprises mainframe and distributed software as well, especially on the whole range from dev ops to business operation platform. An answer -- given that we have almost 1.5 years of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has performance. Financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal, 18 months ago. And it's evidenced in the sense that, as I said, we are able to expand and grow our bookings by focusing on the largest enterprises who buy -- which buy a lot of this software out there in the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we have been successful in selling more capacity, more adjacent products to these large enterprises, which have enabled us to book and to expand bookings in these core accounts over 20% annually over the past 18 months. And so that, to us, has been a great success. 
We're trying to do the same with Symantec, same playbook, the same focus on the core customers, who happens to be very similar set of core customers. We have 2 quarters under our belt now, and we are quite pleased with the way this thing has turned out."

And -- but we basically see very, very strong demand. And our challenge is to be able to optimize how we supply in those situations.

When we talked about the growth rates of wireless over time over the next several years being high single digits, that's what ties into the content growth plus the expectations could take several years to go all 5G."

And you're definitely talking about demand across your end markets being strong. I think Hock used the word surge recently. So how do you handicap the demand strength? Is sell-through sufficient to support the orders? Or are we maybe routing forms in future quarters given that the customers know that there are some supply constraints and maybe robbing from the end of the year and into 2021? I guess, I'm sort of asking if you can bridge sell-in and what you're hearing from your customers on sell-through?"

First and foremost, most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about direct -- orders directly from the end users, both of them. This -- a lot of it is what you all have heard about, strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users, which are the customers of the OEMs, like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct. And as I pointed out too, if anything else, distribution, we are bringing down bookings, channel inventory at distributors back to our of managing our exposure out there. And in this environment of very strong end demand, last thing we need to do is get distracted with channel inventory. So we are very aggressively bringing down channel inventory by reducing shipping to distributors even as their resale is maintained, as I mentioned, depending on end markets at a fairly decent level. So this is all coming direct and from customers, mainly a lot of it cloud customers, a bunch of probably OEMs, these big OEMs who sell to large enterprises. And I think a lot of these guys are not holding -- as far as we're aware, they are not holding it for inventory. It doesn't mean we don't do that for effect. But as far as we can see, they have been deployed or they've been quickly deployed. So we have -- we do not have clear sense on how much inventory are being accumulated, if any."

When you talk about wafer foundries, leading-edge processes. This is not something that just showed up recently. It's over the past many -- several months, lead times at the major foundries for leading-edge processors has already been very, very extended. And as is long lead time for not just wafers, I would add also for specialized material components like substrates. So also a massive long lead time because of capacity limitations. It's something like it happened more than a year ago on MLCCs for [indiscernible]. In this case, it's wafers and all that. I think that -- I think it will improve. It will improve, and we are starting to see some improvement. It will improve as times progress over this. 
What really makes a difference, maybe from the way we're addressing and Tom highlighted it, is many companies out there, when they buy the -- when they try to manufacture their chips, perhaps buying order those from the suppliers on forecast with the anticipation that their forecasts are good and they can, therefore, have a head spot on already prebuilding a lot of that product inventory and therefore, they can supply. But building the forecast obviously carries with some level of risk that you could be forecasting a demand that doesn't materialize. And that's enables you to deliver -- manufacture and deliver the chips, the final product in period less than a normal standard lead time, which would be what you take to start from the beginning of a wafer to the end product. And that is what's happening. The whole lead time from beginning to end is probably longer today and has been that way for months now. It's much longer than normal lead times many of my peer group companies in the semiconductor industry give to their customers. We have chosen now to build because of risk mitigation purposely and build only to orders, not to forecast. And that might be what is the biggest difference here."

I speak for all of Broadcom when I say we are very grateful for your work. I also especially want to thank our team of more than 20,000 employees working all over the world to keep our business running. I'm proud of their tireless efforts to preserve and protect our enterprise. Now more than ever, our customers and communities are counting on us to continue to deliver the essential technologies that enable the continuity of functions critical to daily life.
So now let me turn to our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter. We delivered second quarter net revenue of $5.7 billion, very much in line with our guidance, down 2% sequentially, up 4% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4 billion, declining 2% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, which, of course, includes contribution from Symantec. On a sequential basis, semiconductors were down 4%, while software was up 3%.
So with on to more color, starting with semiconductors. We face a very interesting demand environment in the midst of a challenging supply chain ecosystem. Let me provide more color on various semiconductor end markets beginning with networking. Q2 reflected an expected recovery and was up 11% sequentially. Demand was healthy as we began to ramp our next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products at our various cloud customers and in network routing, Jericho 2 at our telco customers. This steady recovery, which we saw in Q2, is now turning into a demand surge in Q3 as we are seeing strength for existing generation products in addition to this next-generation range. We are also seeing a strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips for a lead cloud customer. In server storage connectivity, we note a similar situation. From a 14% sequential revenue decline in Q2, demand in Q3 has turned around and is accelerating. Demand from enterprise customers for array data protection controllers has recovered and is showing considerable strength. Demand from cloud service providers for our PCI Express switches that drive solid-state memory and AI applications has been particularly strong.
Turning on to broadband, which was flat sequentially in Q2. We expect approximately 10% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter in Q3 driven by strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation excess gateways not only from enterprises but also from telcos and other service providers. We're also seeing increased demand for broadband, DSL and PON and next-generation cable DOCSIS 3.1. That being said, we expect this to be partially offset by a sharp decline in video, particularly in satellite set-top boxes, given the current constraints on live sporting events.
Then moving on to wireless. Wireless saw typical seasonality in Q2, was down 14% sequentially, much like last year. In Q3, we would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer. However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter. So accordingly, we expect our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially as it was down in Q2.
Turning last to industrial. We began to see recovery in Q2, and revenue was up 13% sequentially, consistent with recovery in resales to end market. Even as we expect resales in Q3 to be flat, given the current market uncertainty arising from the current -- the COVID-19 pandemic, we are aggressively moving to bring down channel inventory globally, especially in Europe and Japan. As a result, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in recognized shipping revenue in the third quarter. I would note, resales in Asia Pacific, in particular China, are expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, while other regions -- all other regions are expected to be down. So that's the demand picture.
Now on the supply chain side, we have experienced, and continue to do so, some challenges, some of which are unique to us. Lead times, especially in leading-edge processes, have extended and are running at historical highs. Coupled with this, we have significant test capacity -- repositioned significant test capacity in Malaysia, where we also have a central -- centralized warehouse. And this is a location, which has experienced intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns and significant logistical delays. Bottom line, in Q3, we really have much more demand than we can supply, and this may very well continue beyond Q3.
In summary, we clearly see significant puts and takes: On the positive side, a surge of demand in networking, storage and broadband; on the negative side, supply chain constraints and a product cycle delay in wireless. Therefore, we forecast our semiconductor solution revenue to be up 3% sequentially but only down 5% year-on-year for the third quarter despite the major product cycle delay in wireless.
Right. Now turning to software. CA was up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Bookings in our core accounts grew double digits annually, which was offset by the expected reduction in services revenue. Symantec grew 2% sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. After 2 quarters, we have successfully integrated Symantec onto the Broadcom platform and have largely contributed -- completed the transition. As mentioned, bookings in our core accounts are growing and more than offsetting the transition out of smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. While Brocade was down 21% year-on-year, it was up 11% sequentially in Q2 and was -- and that was the third quarter in a row of sequential growth for Brocade following the Q3 bottom last year.
Looking ahead to next quarter. We expect revenues from CA and Symantec, of course, to sustain on a sequential basis. However, very consistent with our distribution strategy in semiconductors, we are reducing channel inventory significantly for Brocade and expect Brocade revenue will be down significantly quarter-on-quarter in Q3. So as a result, we expect revenue from the software segment to be down approximately 7% sequentially in the third quarter. So in sum, we expect our consolidated third quarter net revenue to be $5.75 billion, roughly flat from Q2. This reflects a 3% sequential projected revenue increase in semiconductors and a 7% sequential expected revenue decline in software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. First, on the P&L. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and relatively flat with Q1, but up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. The increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove the increase. Operating income from continuing operations was $3 billion and represented 53% of net revenue. Operating margins were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter but down year-on-year by approximately 70 basis points, primarily due to the stranded cost for Symantec we carried in the quarter. In fact, operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which was down $28 million compared to Q1 but still included approximately $35 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 56% of net revenue. This figure excludes $147 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow. We had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 20% year-on-year. Collections were quite strong, and it's worth noting that our software businesses are seasonal with December and, to a lesser extent, March being particularly strong bookings months. As a result, our fiscal Q2 was the peak collections period for software.
In addition, we strictly managed working capital to improve liquidity but also out of an abundance of caution given the continuing lack of visibility. Notably, we moved most of our business to build to order during the quarter and are continuing to operate this way. However, the downside to our conservative approach is our ability to respond to short lead time orders is very limited. Overall, we are going to continue to operate and plan for challenging conditions going forward given the uncertain environment.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $219 million in withholding taxes due to -- on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 900,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 402 million outstanding common shares and 452 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 452 million in Q3.
On the financing and investing front, we derisked our balance sheet with over $18 billion of debt refinancing, including $2 billion of commercial paper. This allowed us to push out average debt maturities to 6 years from 4 years, while our average cost of debt increased by just above 50 basis points. Note, these figures are inclusive of the $8 billion financing and 3 point billion -- $3.9 billion, excuse me, exchange offering that we executed in the first month of our third fiscal quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and currently have $14.2 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. Note, we did draw down $3 billion on our revolver earlier in the quarter, all of which we have repaid as part of our refinancing activity. We ended the quarter with $45.8 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. In closing, given our strong free cash flow generation, healthy balance sheet and enhanced liquidity position, we remain committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate this uncertain environment.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call to questions."

So let me spend a few minutes to respond to that and give you a little more color.

An answer -- given that we have almost 1.5 years of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has performance. Financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal 18 months ago. And it's evidenced in the sense that, as I said, we are able to expand and grow our bookings by focusing on the largest enterprises who buy -- which buy a lot of this software out there in the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we have been successful in selling more capacity, more adjacent products to these large enterprises, which have enabled us to book and to expand bookings in these core accounts over 20% annually over the past 18 months.

And we also sell some of these components into hard drives that goes into those near-line cloud data centers. So it's a broad diversity, and in fact, the challenges and constraints on the supply chain cuts across some of these products, not all consistently. And -- but we basically see very, very strong demand, and our challenge is to be able to optimize how we supply in those situations. Very fortunately, in our view, our products are very strong franchises in their own rights, and so I would say, we see our customers are very, very willing and able, in many situations, to work with us as we work through our supply chain challenges. In other words, the demand has not been seen to be perishable."

First and foremost, most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about are direct -- are orders directly from the end users, both of them. This -- and a lot of this is what you all have heard about, strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting most -- a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users, which are the customers of the OEMs, like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct. And as I pointed out too, if anything else, distribution, we are bringing down bookings, channel inventory at distributors back to how -- Tom's view of managing our exposure out there and in this environment, a very strong end demand. Last thing we need to do is get distracted with channel inventory.
So we are very aggressively bringing down channel inventory by reducing ship-in to distributors even as their resale is maintained, as I mentioned, depending on end markets at a fairly decent level. So this is all coming direct and from customers, mainly a lot of it cloud customers, a bunch of probably OEMs, these big OEMs who sell to large enterprises. And I think a lot of these guys are not holding -- as far as we're aware, they are not holding it for inventory. Doesn't mean we don't do that for a fact. But as far as we can see, they have been deployed or they've been quickly deployed. So we have -- we do not have clear sense on how much inventory are being accumulated if any."

When you talk about wafer foundries, leading-edge processes, this is not something that just showed up recently. It's over the past many -- several months, lead times at the major foundries for leading-edge processors has already been very, very extended. And as is long lead time for not just wafers, I would add also for specialized material components like substrates, so also a massive long lead time because of capacity limitations. It's something like it happened more than a year ago on MLCCs for that extent. In this case, it's wafers and all that. I think that -- I think it will improve. It will improve, and we are starting to see some improvement. It will improve as times progress over this.
What really makes a difference, maybe from the way we're addressing and Tom highlighted it, is many companies out there, when they buy their -- when they try to manufacture their chips, perhaps buying, order those from the suppliers on forecast with the anticipation that their forecasts are good and they can, therefore, have a head start on already prebuilding a lot of that product inventory and therefore, they can supply. But building the forecast obviously carries with it a high level -- some level of risk that you could be forecasting a demand that doesn't materialize. And that's -- that enables you to deliver -- manufacture and deliver the chips, the final product in period less than a normal standard lead time, which would be what you take to start from the beginning of a wafer to the end product. And that is what's happening. The whole lead time from beginning to end is probably longer today and has been that way for months now. It's much longer than normal lead times many of my peer group companies in the semiconductor industry give to their customers. We have chosen now to build because of risk mitigation purposely and build only to orders, not to forecast. And that might be what is the biggest difference here."

Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide our quarterly results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank all of the health care professionals and essential workers on the front lines who are showing incredible courage during these unprecedented times. I speak for all of Broadcom when I say we are very grateful for your work. I also especially want to thank our team of more than 20,000 employees working all over the world to keep our business running. I'm proud of their tireless efforts to preserve and protect our enterprise. Now more than ever, our customers and communities are counting on us to continue to deliver the essential technologies that enable the continuity of functions critical to daily life.
So now let me turn to our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter. We delivered second quarter net revenue of $5.7 billion, very much in line with our guidance, down 2% sequentially, up 4% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4 billion, declining 2% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, which, of course, includes contribution from Symantec. On a sequential basis, semiconductors were down 4%, while software was up 3%.
So with on to more color, starting with semiconductors. We face a very interesting demand environment in the midst of a challenging supply chain ecosystem. Let me provide more color on various semiconductor end markets beginning with networking. Q2 reflected an expected recovery and was up 11% sequentially. Demand was healthy as we began to ramp our next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products at our various cloud customers and in network routing, Jericho 2 at our telco customers. This steady recovery, which we saw in Q2, is now turning into a demand surge in Q3 as we are seeing strength for existing generation products in addition to this next-generation range. We are also seeing a strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips for a lead cloud customer. In server storage connectivity, we note a similar situation. From a 14% sequential revenue decline in Q2, demand in Q3 has turned around and is accelerating. Demand from enterprise customers for array data protection controllers has recovered and is showing considerable strength. Demand from cloud service providers for our PCI Express switches that drive solid-state memory and AI applications has been particularly strong.
Turning on to broadband, which was flat sequentially in Q2. We expect approximately 10% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter in Q3 driven by strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation excess gateways not only from enterprises but also from telcos and other service providers. We're also seeing increased demand for broadband, DSL and PON and next-generation cable DOCSIS 3.1. That being said, we expect this to be partially offset by a sharp decline in video, particularly in satellite set-top boxes, given the current constraints on live sporting events.
Then moving on to wireless. Wireless saw typical seasonality in Q2, was down 14% sequentially, much like last year. In Q3, we would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer. However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter. So accordingly, we expect our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially as it was down in Q2.
Turning last to industrial. We began to see recovery in Q2, and revenue was up 13% sequentially, consistent with recovery in resales to end market. Even as we expect resales in Q3 to be flat, given the current market uncertainty arising from the current -- the COVID-19 pandemic, we are aggressively moving to bring down channel inventory globally, especially in Europe and Japan. As a result, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in recognized shipping revenue in the third quarter. I would note, resales in Asia Pacific, in particular China, are expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, while other regions -- all other regions are expected to be down. So that's the demand picture.
Now on the supply chain side, we have experienced, and continue to do so, some challenges, some of which are unique to us. Lead times, especially in leading-edge processes, have extended and are running at historical highs. Coupled with this, we have significant test capacity -- repositioned significant test capacity in Malaysia, where we also have a central -- centralized warehouse. And this is a location, which has experienced intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns and significant logistical delays. Bottom line, in Q3, we really have much more demand than we can supply, and this may very well continue beyond Q3.
In summary, we clearly see significant puts and takes: On the positive side, a surge of demand in networking, storage and broadband; on the negative side, supply chain constraints and a product cycle delay in wireless. Therefore, we forecast our semiconductor solution revenue to be up 3% sequentially but only down 5% year-on-year for the third quarter despite the major product cycle delay in wireless.
Right. Now turning to software. CA was up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Bookings in our core accounts grew double digits annually, which was offset by the expected reduction in services revenue. Symantec grew 2% sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. After 2 quarters, we have successfully integrated Symantec onto the Broadcom platform and have largely contributed -- completed the transition. As mentioned, bookings in our core accounts are growing and more than offsetting the transition out of smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. While Brocade was down 21% year-on-year, it was up 11% sequentially in Q2 and was -- and that was the third quarter in a row of sequential growth for Brocade following the Q3 bottom last year.
Looking ahead to next quarter. We expect revenues from CA and Symantec, of course, to sustain on a sequential basis. However, very consistent with our distribution strategy in semiconductors, we are reducing channel inventory significantly for Brocade and expect Brocade revenue will be down significantly quarter-on-quarter in Q3. So as a result, we expect revenue from the software segment to be down approximately 7% sequentially in the third quarter. So in sum, we expect our consolidated third quarter net revenue to be $5.75 billion, roughly flat from Q2. This reflects a 3% sequential projected revenue increase in semiconductors and a 7% sequential expected revenue decline in software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. First, on the P&L. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and relatively flat with Q1, but up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. The increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove the increase. Operating income from continuing operations was $3 billion and represented 53% of net revenue. Operating margins were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter but down year-on-year by approximately 70 basis points, primarily due to the stranded cost for Symantec we carried in the quarter. In fact, operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which was down $28 million compared to Q1 but still included approximately $35 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 56% of net revenue. This figure excludes $147 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow. We had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 20% year-on-year. Collections were quite strong, and it's worth noting that our software businesses are seasonal with December and, to a lesser extent, March being particularly strong bookings months. As a result, our fiscal Q2 was the peak collections period for software.
In addition, we strictly managed working capital to improve liquidity but also out of an abundance of caution given the continuing lack of visibility. Notably, we moved most of our business to build to order during the quarter and are continuing to operate this way. However, the downside to our conservative approach is our ability to respond to short lead time orders is very limited. Overall, we are going to continue to operate and plan for challenging conditions going forward given the uncertain environment.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $219 million in withholding taxes due to -- on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 900,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 402 million outstanding common shares and 452 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 452 million in Q3.
On the financing and investing front, we derisked our balance sheet with over $18 billion of debt refinancing, including $2 billion of commercial paper. This allowed us to push out average debt maturities to 6 years from 4 years, while our average cost of debt increased by just above 50 basis points. Note, these figures are inclusive of the $8 billion financing and 3 point billion -- $3.9 billion, excuse me, exchange offering that we executed in the first month of our third fiscal quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and currently have $14.2 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. Note, we did draw down $3 billion on our revolver earlier in the quarter, all of which we have repaid as part of our refinancing activity. We ended the quarter with $45.8 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. In closing, given our strong free cash flow generation, healthy balance sheet and enhanced liquidity position, we remain committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate this uncertain environment.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call to questions."

An answer -- given that we have almost 1.5 years of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has performance. Financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal 18 months ago. And it's evidenced in the sense that, as I said, we are able to expand and grow our bookings by focusing on the largest enterprises who buy -- which buy a lot of this software out there in the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we have been successful in selling more capacity, more adjacent products to these large enterprises, which have enabled us to book and to expand bookings in these core accounts over 20% annually over the past 18 months.

First and foremost, most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about are direct -- are orders directly from the end users, both of them. This -- and a lot of this is what you all have heard about, strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting most -- a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users, which are the customers of the OEMs, like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct. And as I pointed out too, if anything else, distribution, we are bringing down bookings, channel inventory at distributors back to how -- Tom's view of managing our exposure out there and in this environment, a very strong end demand. Last thing we need to do is get distracted with channel inventory.
So we are very aggressively bringing down channel inventory by reducing ship-in to distributors even as their resale is maintained, as I mentioned, depending on end markets at a fairly decent level. So this is all coming direct and from customers, mainly a lot of it cloud customers, a bunch of probably OEMs, these big OEMs who sell to large enterprises. And I think a lot of these guys are not holding -- as far as we're aware, they are not holding it for inventory. Doesn't mean we don't do that for a fact.

When you talk about wafer foundries, leading-edge processes, this is not something that just showed up recently. It's over the past many -- several months, lead times at the major foundries for leading-edge processors has already been very, very extended. And as is long lead time for not just wafers, I would add also for specialized material components like substrates, so also a massive long lead time because of capacity limitations. It's something like it happened more than a year ago on MLCCs for that extent. In this case, it's wafers and all that. I think that -- I think it will improve. It will improve, and we are starting to see some improvement. It will improve as times progress over this.
What really makes a difference, maybe from the way we're addressing and Tom highlighted it, is many companies out there, when they buy their -- when they try to manufacture their chips, perhaps buying, order those from the suppliers on forecast with the anticipation that their forecasts are good and they can, therefore, have a head start on already prebuilding a lot of that product inventory and therefore, they can supply. But building the forecast obviously carries with it a high level -- some level of risk that you could be forecasting a demand that doesn't materialize. And that's -- that enables you to deliver -- manufacture and deliver the chips, the final product in period less than a normal standard lead time, which would be what you take to start from the beginning of a wafer to the end product. And that is what's happening. The whole lead time from beginning to end is probably longer today and has been that way for months now. It's much longer than normal lead times many of my peer group companies in the semiconductor industry give to their customers. We have chosen now to build because of risk mitigation purposely and build only to orders, not to forecast. And that might be what is the biggest difference here."

Thank you, Bea, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide our quarterly results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank all of the health care professionals and essential workers on the front lines who are showing incredible courage during these unprecedented times. I speak for all of Broadcom when I say we are very grateful for your work. I also especially want to thank our team of more than 20,000 employees working all over the world to keep our business running. I'm proud of their tireless efforts to preserve and protect our enterprise. Now more than ever, our customers and communities are counting on us to continue to deliver the essential technologies that enable the continuity of functions critical to daily life.
So now let me turn to our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter. We delivered second quarter net revenue of $5.7 billion, very much in line with our guidance, down 2% sequentially, up 4% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4 billion, declining 2% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, which, of course, includes contribution from Symantec. On a sequential basis, semiconductors were down 4%, while software was up 3%.
So with on to more color, starting with semiconductors. We face a very interesting demand environment in the midst of a challenging supply chain ecosystem. Let me provide more color on various semiconductor end markets beginning with networking. Q2 reflected an expected recovery and was up 11% sequentially. Demand was healthy as we began to ramp our next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products at our various cloud customers and in network routing, Jericho 2 at our telco customers. This steady recovery, which we saw in Q2, is now turning into a demand surge in Q3 as we are seeing strength for existing generation products in addition to this next-generation range. We are also seeing a strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips for a lead cloud customer. In server storage connectivity, we note a similar situation. From a 14% sequential revenue decline in Q2, demand in Q3 has turned around and is accelerating. Demand from enterprise customers for array data protection controllers has recovered and is showing considerable strength. Demand from cloud service providers for our PCI Express switches that drive solid-state memory and AI applications has been particularly strong.
Turning on to broadband, which was flat sequentially in Q2. We expect approximately 10% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter in Q3 driven by strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation excess gateways not only from enterprises but also from telcos and other service providers. We're also seeing increased demand for broadband, DSL and PON and next-generation cable DOCSIS 3.1. That being said, we expect this to be partially offset by a sharp decline in video, particularly in satellite set-top boxes, given the current constraints on live sporting events.
Then moving on to wireless. Wireless saw typical seasonality in Q2, was down 14% sequentially, much like last year. In Q3, we would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer. However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter. So accordingly, we expect our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially as it was down in Q2.
Turning last to industrial. We began to see recovery in Q2, and revenue was up 13% sequentially, consistent with recovery in resales to end market. Even as we expect resales in Q3 to be flat, given the current market uncertainty arising from the current -- the COVID-19 pandemic, we are aggressively moving to bring down channel inventory globally, especially in Europe and Japan. As a result, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in recognized shipping revenue in the third quarter. I would note, resales in Asia Pacific, in particular China, are expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, while other regions -- all other regions are expected to be down. So that's the demand picture.
Now on the supply chain side, we have experienced, and continue to do so, some challenges, some of which are unique to us. Lead times, especially in leading-edge processes, have extended and are running at historical highs. Coupled with this, we have significant test capacity -- repositioned significant test capacity in Malaysia, where we also have a central -- centralized warehouse. And this is a location, which has experienced intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns and significant logistical delays. Bottom line, in Q3, we really have much more demand than we can supply, and this may very well continue beyond Q3.
In summary, we clearly see significant puts and takes: On the positive side, a surge of demand in networking, storage and broadband; on the negative side, supply chain constraints and a product cycle delay in wireless. Therefore, we forecast our semiconductor solution revenue to be up 3% sequentially but only down 5% year-on-year for the third quarter despite the major product cycle delay in wireless.
Right. Now turning to software. CA was up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Bookings in our core accounts grew double digits annually, which was offset by the expected reduction in services revenue. Symantec grew 2% sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. After 2 quarters, we have successfully integrated Symantec onto the Broadcom platform and have largely contributed -- completed the transition. As mentioned, bookings in our core accounts are growing and more than offsetting the transition out of smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. While Brocade was down 21% year-on-year, it was up 11% sequentially in Q2 and was -- and that was the third quarter in a row of sequential growth for Brocade following the Q3 bottom last year.
Looking ahead to next quarter. We expect revenues from CA and Symantec, of course, to sustain on a sequential basis. However, very consistent with our distribution strategy in semiconductors, we are reducing channel inventory significantly for Brocade and expect Brocade revenue will be down significantly quarter-on-quarter in Q3. So as a result, we expect revenue from the software segment to be down approximately 7% sequentially in the third quarter. So in sum, we expect our consolidated third quarter net revenue to be $5.75 billion, roughly flat from Q2. This reflects a 3% sequential projected revenue increase in semiconductors and a 7% sequential expected revenue decline in software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. First, on the P&L. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and relatively flat with Q1, but up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. The increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove the increase. Operating income from continuing operations was $3 billion and represented 53% of net revenue. Operating margins were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter but down year-on-year by approximately 70 basis points, primarily due to the stranded cost for Symantec we carried in the quarter. In fact, operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which was down $28 million compared to Q1 but still included approximately $35 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 56% of net revenue. This figure excludes $147 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow. We had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 20% year-on-year. Collections were quite strong, and it's worth noting that our software businesses are seasonal with December and, to a lesser extent, March being particularly strong bookings months. As a result, our fiscal Q2 was the peak collections period for software.
In addition, we strictly managed working capital to improve liquidity but also out of an abundance of caution given the continuing lack of visibility. Notably, we moved most of our business to build to order during the quarter and are continuing to operate this way. However, the downside to our conservative approach is our ability to respond to short lead time orders is very limited. Overall, we are going to continue to operate and plan for challenging conditions going forward given the uncertain environment.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $219 million in withholding taxes due to -- on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 900,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 402 million outstanding common shares and 452 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 452 million in Q3.
On the financing and investing front, we derisked our balance sheet with over $18 billion of debt refinancing, including $2 billion of commercial paper. This allowed us to push out average debt maturities to 6 years from 4 years, while our average cost of debt increased by just above 50 basis points. Note, these figures are inclusive of the $8 billion financing and 3 point billion -- $3.9 billion, excuse me, exchange offering that we executed in the first month of our third fiscal quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and currently have $14.2 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. Note, we did draw down $3 billion on our revolver earlier in the quarter, all of which we have repaid as part of our refinancing activity. We ended the quarter with $45.8 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. In closing, given our strong free cash flow generation, healthy balance sheet and enhanced liquidity position, we remain committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate this uncertain environment.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call to questions."

So let me spend a few minutes to respond to that and give you a little more color.

An answer -- given that we have almost 1.5 years of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has performance. Financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal 18 months ago. And it's evidenced in the sense that, as I said, we are able to expand and grow our bookings by focusing on the largest enterprises who buy -- which buy a lot of this software out there in the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we have been successful in selling more capacity, more adjacent products to these large enterprises, which have enabled us to book and to expand bookings in these core accounts over 20% annually over the past 18 months.

I think it was going from $1.1 billion last year to like $500 million this year.
And more generally, 2 quarters ago, you gave some wireless growth targets for the year. I think it was down about 10% for the full year. I assume you're tracking below that now given what's going on. But can you give us some order of magnitude idea of how the wireless business is actually tracking right now versus the color that you had given us 2 quarters ago for what to expect this year?"

First and foremost, most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about are direct -- are orders directly from the end users, both of them. This -- and a lot of this is what you all have heard about, strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting most -- a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users, which are the customers of the OEMs, like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct. And as I pointed out too, if anything else, distribution, we are bringing down bookings, channel inventory at distributors back to how -- Tom's view of managing our exposure out there and in this environment, a very strong end demand. Last thing we need to do is get distracted with channel inventory.
So we are very aggressively bringing down channel inventory by reducing ship-in to distributors even as their resale is maintained, as I mentioned, depending on end markets at a fairly decent level. So this is all coming direct and from customers, mainly a lot of it cloud customers, a bunch of probably OEMs, these big OEMs who sell to large enterprises. And I think a lot of these guys are not holding -- as far as we're aware, they are not holding it for inventory. Doesn't mean we don't do that for a fact. But as far as we can see, they have been deployed or they've been quickly deployed. So we have -- we do not have clear sense on how much inventory are being accumulated if any."

When you talk about wafer foundries, leading-edge processes, this is not something that just showed up recently. It's over the past many -- several months, lead times at the major foundries for leading-edge processors has already been very, very extended. And as is long lead time for not just wafers, I would add also for specialized material components like substrates, so also a massive long lead time because of capacity limitations. It's something like it happened more than a year ago on MLCCs for that extent. In this case, it's wafers and all that. I think that -- I think it will improve. It will improve, and we are starting to see some improvement. It will improve as times progress over this.
What really makes a difference, maybe from the way we're addressing and Tom highlighted it, is many companies out there, when they buy their -- when they try to manufacture their chips, perhaps buying, order those from the suppliers on forecast with the anticipation that their forecasts are good and they can, therefore, have a head start on already prebuilding a lot of that product inventory and therefore, they can supply. But building the forecast obviously carries with it a high level -- some level of risk that you could be forecasting a demand that doesn't materialize. And that's -- that enables you to deliver -- manufacture and deliver the chips, the final product in period less than a normal standard lead time, which would be what you take to start from the beginning of a wafer to the end product. And that is what's happening. The whole lead time from beginning to end is probably longer today and has been that way for months now. It's much longer than normal lead times many of my peer group companies in the semiconductor industry give to their customers. We have chosen now to build because of risk mitigation purposely and build only to orders, not to forecast. And that might be what is the biggest difference here."

I speak for all of Broadcom when I say we are very grateful for your work. I also especially want to thank our team of more than 20,000 employees working all over the world to keep our business running. I'm proud of their tireless efforts to preserve and protect our enterprise. Now more than ever, our customers and communities are counting on us to continue to deliver the essential technologies that enable the continuity of functions critical to daily life.
So now let me turn to our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter. We delivered second quarter net revenue of $5.7 billion, very much in line with our guidance, down 2% sequentially, up 4% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4 billion, declining 2% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year, which, of course, includes contribution from Symantec. On a sequential basis, semiconductors were down 4%, while software was up 3%.
So with on to more color, starting with semiconductors. We face a very interesting demand environment in the midst of a challenging supply chain ecosystem. Let me provide more color on various semiconductor end markets beginning with networking. Q2 reflected an expected recovery and was up 11% sequentially. Demand was healthy as we began to ramp our next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products at our various cloud customers and in network routing, Jericho 2 at our telco customers. This steady recovery, which we saw in Q2, is now turning into a demand surge in Q3 as we are seeing strength for existing generation products in addition to this next-generation range. We are also seeing a strong uplift in demand from the ramp of next-generation deep learning inference chips for a lead cloud customer. In server storage connectivity, we note a similar situation. From a 14% sequential revenue decline in Q2, demand in Q3 has turned around and is accelerating. Demand from enterprise customers for array data protection controllers has recovered and is showing considerable strength. Demand from cloud service providers for our PCI Express switches that drive solid-state memory and AI applications has been particularly strong.
Turning on to broadband, which was flat sequentially in Q2. We expect approximately 10% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter in Q3 driven by strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation excess gateways not only from enterprises but also from telcos and other service providers. We're also seeing increased demand for broadband, DSL and PON and next-generation cable DOCSIS 3.1. That being said, we expect this to be partially offset by a sharp decline in video, particularly in satellite set-top boxes, given the current constraints on live sporting events.
Then moving on to wireless. Wireless saw typical seasonality in Q2, was down 14% sequentially, much like last year. In Q3, we would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer. However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter. So accordingly, we expect our wireless revenue in Q3 will be down sequentially as it was down in Q2.
Turning last to industrial. We began to see recovery in Q2, and revenue was up 13% sequentially, consistent with recovery in resales to end market. Even as we expect resales in Q3 to be flat, given the current market uncertainty arising from the current -- the COVID-19 pandemic, we are aggressively moving to bring down channel inventory globally, especially in Europe and Japan. As a result, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in recognized shipping revenue in the third quarter. I would note, resales in Asia Pacific, in particular China, are expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, while other regions -- all other regions are expected to be down. So that's the demand picture.
Now on the supply chain side, we have experienced, and continue to do so, some challenges, some of which are unique to us. Lead times, especially in leading-edge processes, have extended and are running at historical highs. Coupled with this, we have significant test capacity -- repositioned significant test capacity in Malaysia, where we also have a central -- centralized warehouse. And this is a location, which has experienced intermittent COVID-19 lockdowns and significant logistical delays. Bottom line, in Q3, we really have much more demand than we can supply, and this may very well continue beyond Q3.
In summary, we clearly see significant puts and takes: On the positive side, a surge of demand in networking, storage and broadband; on the negative side, supply chain constraints and a product cycle delay in wireless. Therefore, we forecast our semiconductor solution revenue to be up 3% sequentially but only down 5% year-on-year for the third quarter despite the major product cycle delay in wireless.
Right. Now turning to software. CA was up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. Bookings in our core accounts grew double digits annually, which was offset by the expected reduction in services revenue. Symantec grew 2% sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. After 2 quarters, we have successfully integrated Symantec onto the Broadcom platform and have largely contributed -- completed the transition. As mentioned, bookings in our core accounts are growing and more than offsetting the transition out of smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. While Brocade was down 21% year-on-year, it was up 11% sequentially in Q2 and was -- and that was the third quarter in a row of sequential growth for Brocade following the Q3 bottom last year.
Looking ahead to next quarter. We expect revenues from CA and Symantec, of course, to sustain on a sequential basis. However, very consistent with our distribution strategy in semiconductors, we are reducing channel inventory significantly for Brocade and expect Brocade revenue will be down significantly quarter-on-quarter in Q3. So as a result, we expect revenue from the software segment to be down approximately 7% sequentially in the third quarter. So in sum, we expect our consolidated third quarter net revenue to be $5.75 billion, roughly flat from Q2. This reflects a 3% sequential projected revenue increase in semiconductors and a 7% sequential expected revenue decline in software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. First, on the P&L. Gross margins were 73% of revenue in the quarter and relatively flat with Q1, but up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. The increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove the increase. Operating income from continuing operations was $3 billion and represented 53% of net revenue. Operating margins were effectively flat quarter-over-quarter but down year-on-year by approximately 70 basis points, primarily due to the stranded cost for Symantec we carried in the quarter. In fact, operating expenses were $1.2 billion, which was down $28 million compared to Q1 but still included approximately $35 million of Symantec-related expenses that we expect to go away over the remainder of the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion and represented 56% of net revenue. This figure excludes $147 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow. We had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 20% year-on-year. Collections were quite strong, and it's worth noting that our software businesses are seasonal with December and, to a lesser extent, March being particularly strong bookings months. As a result, our fiscal Q2 was the peak collections period for software.
In addition, we strictly managed working capital to improve liquidity but also out of an abundance of caution given the continuing lack of visibility. Notably, we moved most of our business to build to order during the quarter and are continuing to operate this way. However, the downside to our conservative approach is our ability to respond to short lead time orders is very limited. Overall, we are going to continue to operate and plan for challenging conditions going forward given the uncertain environment.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $219 million in withholding taxes due to -- on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 900,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 402 million outstanding common shares and 452 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 452 million in Q3.
On the financing and investing front, we derisked our balance sheet with over $18 billion of debt refinancing, including $2 billion of commercial paper. This allowed us to push out average debt maturities to 6 years from 4 years, while our average cost of debt increased by just above 50 basis points. Note, these figures are inclusive of the $8 billion financing and 3 point billion -- $3.9 billion, excuse me, exchange offering that we executed in the first month of our third fiscal quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $9.2 billion of cash and currently have $14.2 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. Note, we did draw down $3 billion on our revolver earlier in the quarter, all of which we have repaid as part of our refinancing activity. We ended the quarter with $45.8 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. In closing, given our strong free cash flow generation, healthy balance sheet and enhanced liquidity position, we remain committed to maintaining our dividend while we navigate this uncertain environment.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open the call to questions."

So let me spend a few minutes to respond to that and give you a little more color. We now have CA under our belt, and CA comprises mainframe and distributed software as well, especially on the whole range from dev ops to business operation platform. An answer -- given that we have almost 1.5 years of CA under our belt, we're very, very pleased with that acquisition. It has performance. Financial performance of CA has exceeded even our regional plan when we did the deal 18 months ago. And it's evidenced in the sense that, as I said, we are able to expand and grow our bookings by focusing on the largest enterprises who buy -- which buy a lot of this software out there in the world. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we have been successful in selling more capacity, more adjacent products to these large enterprises, which have enabled us to book and to expand bookings in these core accounts over 20% annually over the past 18 months. And so that, to us, has been a great success.
We're trying to do the same with Symantec, same playbook, the same focus on the core customers, who happens to be very similar set of core customers. We have 2 quarters under our belt now, and we are quite pleased with the way this thing has turned out."

First and foremost, most of all these orders, all these big demand constraint we're talking about are direct -- are orders directly from the end users, both of them. This -- and a lot of this is what you all have heard about, strength in the cloud. Mega scale cloud vendors are buying it. Strength in broadband from -- directly from the telcos, the service providers. We are getting most -- a lot of these customers we deal with directly. And even if they go through OEMs, not distributors, OEMs, we have clear visibility on pools from end users, which are the customers of the OEMs, like the telcos, the cable companies, service providers. So these are all largely direct. And as I pointed out too, if anything else, distribution, we are bringing down bookings, channel inventory at distributors back to how -- Tom's view of managing our exposure out there and in this environment, a very strong end demand. Last thing we need to do is get distracted with channel inventory.
So we are very aggressively bringing down channel inventory by reducing ship-in to distributors even as their resale is maintained, as I mentioned, depending on end markets at a fairly decent level. So this is all coming direct and from customers, mainly a lot of it cloud customers, a bunch of probably OEMs, these big OEMs who sell to large enterprises. And I think a lot of these guys are not holding -- as far as we're aware, they are not holding it for inventory. Doesn't mean we don't do that for a fact. But as far as we can see, they have been deployed or they've been quickly deployed. So we have -- we do not have clear sense on how much inventory are being accumulated if any."

When you talk about wafer foundries, leading-edge processes, this is not something that just showed up recently. It's over the past many -- several months, lead times at the major foundries for leading-edge processors has already been very, very extended. And as is long lead time for not just wafers, I would add also for specialized material components like substrates, so also a massive long lead time because of capacity limitations. It's something like it happened more than a year ago on MLCCs for that extent. In this case, it's wafers and all that. I think that -- I think it will improve. It will improve, and we are starting to see some improvement. It will improve as times progress over this.
What really makes a difference, maybe from the way we're addressing and Tom highlighted it, is many companies out there, when they buy their -- when they try to manufacture their chips, perhaps buying, order those from the suppliers on forecast with the anticipation that their forecasts are good and they can, therefore, have a head start on already prebuilding a lot of that product inventory and therefore, they can supply. But building the forecast obviously carries with it a high level -- some level of risk that you could be forecasting a demand that doesn't materialize. And that's -- that enables you to deliver -- manufacture and deliver the chips, the final product in period less than a normal standard lead time, which would be what you take to start from the beginning of a wafer to the end product. And that is what's happening. The whole lead time from beginning to end is probably longer today and has been that way for months now. It's much longer than normal lead times many of my peer group companies in the semiconductor industry give to their customers. We have chosen now to build because of risk mitigation purposely and build only to orders, not to forecast. And that might be what is the biggest difference here."

I have to say that the strength of our broad and diversified portfolio of leadership technology franchises led to record third quarter revenue for Broadcom despite these uncertain times, we continue to operate in. We remain well positioned to address the work-from-home environment, especially with many of our networking and broadband products in the cloud and telcos. In addition, we expect to soon start from benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year. While there continues to be ebb and flow in the parts of our business linked to enterprise, this is somewhat offset by the highly recurring revenue of our infrastructure software divisions. So as a result, we remain confident in the strategy we have laid out over the past several years, delivering sustainable revenue and significant cash flow margins, while remaining focused on total shareholder return. 
Let me now provide further detail on our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $5.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 1% sequentially and up 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 41% year-on-year, which, of course, does include the contribution from Symantec in 2020. 
Starting with semiconductors. Our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially, driven by continued strength in networking and broadband. Networking was up 9% sequentially due to continued healthy demand from our cloud customers as we began to ramp for next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products. Routing demand also remains strong as telcos launch our Jericho 2 in the EDGE and core networks. We expect the strength in networking that we have experienced since the beginning of this fiscal year to sustain in Q4 with continued demand from cloud and telcos driving solid sequential growth. 
Turning to broadband, which was up 7% sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong demand for the next-generation cable modem cable DOCSIS 3.1, which was partially offset by a decline in the satellite set-top boxes. We also continue to see strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumer and even in large enterprises. Telecom and consumer have been particularly strong, driven by work-from-home environment. But after a strong Q3, we expect the strength in broadband revenue to take pause and come down on a sequential basis by approximately 10% in Q4. Keep in mind, however, this will still be up 20% on a year-on-year basis. 
Moving on, wireless was down 4% sequentially in Q3 due to the expected typical ramp being pushed out this year. This is expected to result in a significant uplift, however, in wireless revenue of approximately 50% sequentially in Q4. Despite this significant sequential ramp and a significant increase all in our RF content, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year in Q4. Now this is due to fewer units of our parts for the next-generation phone being shipped in the fourth quarter this year relative to last year due to this product delay. That being said, we currently expect Q1 revenue in wireless to be up sequentially from Q4, with an increase in expected unit shipments of our products for the next-generation phone compared to Q1 last year. In other words, the launch ramp this year is expected to complete only in Q1 where it's normally been completed in Q4 of previous years. 
In server storage connectivity, where the majority of the revenue is tied to enterprise, Q3 was up 10% sequentially. However, expected softness in enterprise demand will likely result in service storage revenue declining in high single digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4. 
Turning last to industrial. Resales and revenues were both down 3% sequentially in Q3. In Q4, we expect resales to continue to hold up. However, we are taking the opportunity to further reduce our channel inventory significantly. And as a result, we expect industrial revenue to be down double digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4. 
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially in Q3. And given the continuing surge of demand in networking, and the expected 5G phone ramp in wireless, we expect a mid-teens percentage sequential increase in our fourth fiscal quarter. We should note, on a year-on-year basis, Q4 will mark a return to growth for our semiconductor segment overall, which we think is a key inflection point for Broadcom and which we expect to sustain into Q1. 
Now turning to software. CA was up 6% year-on-year, flat sequentially. Bookings at our core accounts continued to grow double digits year-on-year and has offset the expected reduction in the services business. Symantec was flat sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. Similar to CA, bookings in our Symantec core accounts are growing, offsetting the transition out of the smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. Brocade was up 3% year-on-year, and as expected, was down significantly sequentially. 
Looking ahead to next quarter on a sequential basis, we expect revenues from CA to sustain and expect Symantec revenue to be up 4%. We anticipate Brocade revenue to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And as a result, revenue from the software segment is expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage sequentially in the fourth quarter. 
So in summary, we expect our fourth quarter net revenue to be $6.4 billion, up 10% sequentially from Q3. This reflects an approximate mid-teens percentage sequential projected revenue increase in the semiconductor solutions side and a low single-digit percentage sequential revenue increase in infrastructure software. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me provide some additional detail on our financial performance. First, on the P&L, gross margins were a record 74% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 110 basis points from Q2 and up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. The year-on-year increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove a large part of the increase. 
Operating income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion and represented 55% of net revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and better gross margin due to mix. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which was down $25 million compared to Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation. 
Looking at cash flow, we had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 33% year-on-year. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $192 million in withholding taxes due on vesting employee equity, resulting in elimination of approximately 700,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 404 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at $451 million in Q4. 
On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $1.9 billion in the quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we executed an $8 billion bond refinancing and $3.9 billion exchange offering. Through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, we've been able to push out our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 6 years and reduce our weighted average interest rate to approximately 3%. 
All told, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of cash and currently have $13.9 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $44 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. 
Finally, given our strong free cash flow generation and as we look to further deleverage the balance sheet, we plan to pay down an additional $3 billion of debt in our fiscal fourth quarter. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

Clarification, I just wanted to make sure your outlook kind of excludes or reflects if there are any restrictions on shipment to any Chinese customers. 
And then, Hock, my real question is on 5G. You gave us very good color on the near-term trends. But what have you seen in the first market for 5G, which was China is -- the transition happened very quickly. The majority of phones there are now 5G.

And right now, to be honest, about this, we don't know how fast the ramp on 5G will occur. Understand what you said about China and understand how operators might push to make that happen in terms of incentives. Where we stand at this point, we are seeing the demand more coming from our OEM -- key strategic OEM customers.

Hock, I wanted to dive a little bit into the networking portion, where you said the cloud side and the telecom side is strong. There's been some fear in the end market as a whole that we're potentially entering a digestion phase from the cloud side of that equation. And then very recently, one of your pseudo competitors talked about some service provider lull in demand there as well. It doesn't seem like you're seeing that. Is end market different in your view? Is it weakening or not? Or are you just overcoming that with company-specific new product launches and ramps?"

Well, again, that's a very interesting question on WiFi 6 because with regard to WiFi, that's a key franchise we invest a lot of resources into. When talking about investing, considerable dollars, R&D dollars in this space because we need on 2 areas. As you probably know, we supply WiFi, the latest leadership products in flagship phones, particularly in our strategic North American OEM. We provide all those WiFi Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area where we have a strong leadership position. 
We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the current 802.11ax generation in access, what I call mentioned access gateways. Basically, it's almost like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices and connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, bring -- basically bringing data, video signals into your homes. And in this environment of work-from-home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes. Because those terminations, whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL or very often terminate in WiFi access gateways that allows the signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know, WiFi retail route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for their own homes, and that's creating a very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what is a -- what a lot of it comprises WiFi 6."

But as you know, pre-COVID-19, as we got into fiscal '20, and the semiconductor industry starts to improve, we had indicated and you report, there were certain constraints, supply chain constraints, particularly in regard to wafers, especially leading-edge wafers, leading the most advanced node leading-edge wafers and even then substrates, particular substrates that needed to package semiconductors. 
COVID-19 shows up, just creates a layer of complexity on supply chain. And the reason was, as we indicated 3 months ago, depending on where you outsource -- or where factories are, especially in Asia, parts of Asia, you face situations of lockdowns, operating under capacity. And we faced them. We faced that for several months. Now that has normalized somewhat in terms of the back end, where we have 10 assembly factories that were locked down or running below capacity. Most of that has been resolved. Having said that, the constraint on supply chain, constraint on wafers and substrates continues. And that's what we still face today. And so lead -- to be honest, our lead times are still very extended based on the technology nodes and the particular products that we produce and sell. And given the kind of products we do, we see some of that constraint. And I'll be direct. We could have shipped more in Q3 if such constraints were not as tight."

And so I think we want to wait, obviously, until we get to the end of the year, talk to the Board, look at the outlook for '21 before we jump to any conclusions. 
But you're right. I mean our capital allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year. We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with. We think with the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. 
And then we're back to sort of, I think, normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive total shareholder return above and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year, but look forward to executing this quarter, posting results and then having that discussion."

But on semiconductors, particularly, this is not a philosophy or this is not a model that we're just coming out with. It's always been there. It's the nature of technology and nature of the semiconductor technology markets. As you know, we have a broad portfolio of this franchise leadership products. And we come out with them, come out with next-generation products in a very steady cadence of product life cycle. For instance, in wireless, our products come out every 12, 18 months, a new generation of products; in networking, 2, 3 years; storage, 4, 5 years; industrial, anywhere from 4 to 8 years. But it comes on. And that's why we put in the R&D to make sure our products create value for customers, each new generation adding more value. And with each generation that we add value, we have the opportunity to extract, ratchet up the value, financial value for delivering on this much better, higher-performance products. It's a natural cycle. 
And so with revenue generation, your margin improves. Think about it, we have a range of about 16, 17 broad range of products in various end markets with different product cycles. You do go through that model. What we have seen empirically, over the last 10 years is the gross margin of this mix of products grows natural -- expands naturally 50 to 100 basis points each year.

So I mean, I think when you take that, you look at -- and we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the semiconductor business turning the corner and now returning to growth, which I think is important. You layer in increasing diversification from software and the scale that affords us and of course, the margins that it brings, especially with the synergies on the go-to-market that we're driving. I think over the horizon here, I think we see a path, frankly, 30% to 60% EBITDA margins. I think that's the next stop. 
But I think Hock's right, we have consequently over many, many years by driving more content increase through R&D investments, been able to drive margins up incrementally. And that will contribute to the overall success of the margin increases that we see coming."

Yes, that's almost -- the simplest way to look at it is we signed software contracts, whether it's on subscription or even on license and maintenance for 3-year term contracts, 3 years. So at any point in time, in any 1 year, you're really seeing only roughly 1/3 of our outstanding contract backlog coming up for renewals. And so we -- so for those 1/3 contract, we are seeing that double-digit booking growth as we renew those contracts, bookings being referred to as renewals of this contract. So when you take that part and keep in mind, you still have the other 2/3 backlog that continues as we recognize revenue ratably, very much so. Every contract we sign out at renewal, we recognize revenue ratably over 3 years, so you have to dilute that in. And that's why what happens is that double-digit bookings rate increase translates when diluted with the rest of the backlog that is chugging along steadily flat to effectively a mid-single-digit growth rate in revenue.

I have to say that the strength of our broad and diversified portfolio of leadership technology franchises led to record third quarter revenue for Broadcom despite these uncertain times we continue to operate in. We remain well positioned to address the work-from-home environment, especially with many of our networking and broadband products in the cloud and telcos. In addition, we expect to soon start from benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year. While there continues to be ebb and flow in the parts of our business linked to enterprise, this is somewhat offset by the highly recurring revenue of our infrastructure software divisions. So as a result, we remain confident in the strategy we have laid out over the past several years, delivering sustainable revenue and significant cash flow margins while remaining focused on total shareholder return.
Let me now provide further detail on our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $5.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 1% sequentially and up 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 41% year-on-year, which, of course, does include the contribution from Symantec in 2020.
Starting with semiconductors. Our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially driven by continued strength in networking and broadband. Networking was up 9% sequentially due to continued healthy demand from our cloud customers as we began to ramp for next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products. Routing demand also remains strong as telcos launch our Jericho 2 in the EDGE and core networks. We expect the strength in networking that we have experienced since the beginning of this fiscal year to sustain in Q4, with continued demand from cloud and telcos driving solid sequential growth.
Turning to broadband, which was up 7% sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong demand for the next-generation cable modem DOCSIS 3.1, which was partially offset by a decline in the satellite set-top boxes. We also continue to see strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumer and even in large enterprises. Telecom and consumer have been particularly strong driven by work-from-home environment. But after a strong Q3, we expect the strength in broadband revenue to take a pause and come down on a sequential basis by approximately 10% in Q4. Keep in mind, however, this will still be up 20% on a year-on-year basis.
Moving on, wireless was down 4% sequentially in Q3 due to the expected typical ramp being pushed out this year. This is expected to result in a significant uplift, however, in wireless revenue of approximately 50% sequentially in Q4. Despite this significant sequential ramp and a significant increase in our RF content, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year in Q4. Now this is due to fewer units of our parts for the next-generation phone being shipped in the fourth quarter this year relative to last year due to this product delay. That being said, we currently expect Q1 revenue in wireless to be up sequentially from Q4 with an increase in expected unit shipments of our parts for the next-generation phone compared to Q1 last year. In other words, the launch ramp this year is expected to complete only in Q1 where it's normally been completed in Q4 of previous years.
In server storage connectivity where the majority of the revenue is tied to enterprise, Q3 was up 10% sequentially. However, expected softness in enterprise demand will likely result in server storage revenue declining in high single digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
Turning last to industrial. Resales and revenues were both down 3% sequentially in Q3. In Q4, we expect resales to continue to hold up. However, we are taking the opportunity to further reduce our channel inventory significantly. And as a result, we expect industrial revenue to be down double digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially in Q3. And given the continuing surge of demand in networking and the expected 5G phone ramp in wireless, we expect a mid-teens percentage sequential increase in our fourth fiscal quarter. We should note, on a year-on-year basis, Q4 will mark a return to growth for our semiconductor segment overall, which we think is a key inflection point for Broadcom and which we expect to sustain into Q1.
Now turning to software. CA was up 6% year-on-year, flat sequentially. Bookings at our core accounts continued to grow double digits year-on-year and has offset the expected reduction in the services business. Symantec was flat sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. Similar to CA, bookings in our Symantec core accounts are growing, offsetting the transition out of the smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. Brocade was up 3% year-on-year and, as expected, was down significantly sequentially. Looking ahead to next quarter on a sequential basis, we expect revenues from CA to sustain and expect Symantec revenue to be up 4%. We anticipate Brocade revenue to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And as a result, revenue from the software segment is expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage sequentially in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, we expect our fourth quarter net revenue to be $6.4 billion, up 10% sequentially from Q3. This reflects an approximate mid-teens percentage sequential projected revenue increase in the semiconductor solutions side and a low single-digit percentage sequential revenue increase in infrastructure software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me provide some additional detail on our financial performance.
First, on the P&L, gross margins were a record 74% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 110 basis points from Q2 and up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. The year-on-year increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove a large part of the increase.
Operating income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion and represented 55% of net revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and better gross margin due to mix. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which was down $25 million compared to Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow, we had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 33% year-on-year.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $192 million in withholding taxes due on vesting employee equity, resulting in elimination of approximately 700,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 404 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 451 million in Q4.
On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $1.9 billion in the quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we executed an $8 billion bond refinancing and $3.9 billion exchange offering. Through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, we've been able to push out our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 6 years and reduce our weighted average interest rate to approximately 3%. All told, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of cash and currently have $13.9 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $44 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. Finally, given our strong free cash flow generation and as we look to further deleverage the balance sheet, we plan to pay down an additional $3 billion of debt in our fiscal fourth quarter.

Well, again, that's a very interesting question on WiFi 6 because, with regard to WiFi, that's a key franchise we invest a lot of resources into. We're talking about investing considerable dollars, R&D dollars, in this space because we are needed on 2 areas. As you probably know, we supply WiFi, the latest leadership products, in flagship phones, particularly in our strategic North American OEM. We provide all those WiFi/Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area where we have a strong leadership position. We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the current 802.11ax generation in access -- what they call, mention, access gateways. Basically, it's almost like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices, and connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, bring -- basically bring data, video signals into houses -- into your homes.
And in this environment of work from home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes because those terminations, whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL very often terminates in WiFi access gateways that allows the signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know it, WiFi retail route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for the own homes, and that's creating a very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what is a lot -- what a lot of it comprises WiFi 6."

But as you know, pre-COVID-19, as we got into fiscal '20 and the semiconductor industry started to improve, we had indicated and you all inferred, there were certain constraints, supply chain constraints, particularly in regard to wafers, especially leading-edge wafers, leading -- the most advanced node, leading-edge wafers and even then, substrates, particular substrates, that needed to package semiconductors. COVID-19 shows up, just creates a layer of complexity on supply chain. And the reason was, as we indicated 3 months ago, depending on where you outsource -- or where factories are, especially in Asia, parts of Asia, you face situations of lockdowns, operating under capacity.
And we faced them. We faced that for several months. Now that has normalized somewhat in terms of the back end where we have 10 assembly factories that were locked down or running below capacity. Most of that has been resolved. Having said that, the constraint on supply chain, constraint on wafers and substrates continues. And that's what we still face today. And so lead -- to be honest, our lead times are still very extended based on the technology nodes and the particular products that we produce and sell. And given the kind of products we do, we see some of that constraint. And I'll be direct, we could have shipped more in Q3 if such constraints were not as tight."

And so I think we want to wait, obviously, until we get to the end of the year, talk to the Board, look at the outlook for '21 before we jump to any conclusions. But you're right. I mean our capital allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year.
We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with. We think the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. And then we're back to sort of, I think, a normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive the total shareholder return above and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either to M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year but look forward to executing in this quarter, posting results and then having that discussion."

But it comes on.
And that's why we put in the R&D to make sure our products create value for customers, each new generation adding more value. And with each generation that we add value, we have the opportunity to extract and ratchet up the value, financial value, for delivering on this much better, higher-performance products. It's a natural cycle. And so with revenue generation, your margin improves. Think about it, we have a range of about 16, 17 broad range of products in various end markets with different product cycles. You do go through that model. What we have seen empirically, over the last 10 years, is the gross margin of this mix of products grows naturally -- expands naturally 50 to 100 basis points each year.

Yes, that's almost -- the simplest way to look at it is we sign software contracts, whether it's on subscription or even on license and maintenance, for a 3-year term contracts, 3 years. So at any point in time, at any 1 year, you're really seeing only roughly 1/3 of our outstanding contract backlog coming up for renewals. And so we -- so for those 1/3 contracts, we are seeing that double-digit booking growth as we renew those contracts, bookings being referred to as renewals of those contracts. So when you take that part, and keep in mind, you still have the other 2/3 backlog that continues, we recognize revenue ratably, very much so.
Every contract we sign up at renewal, we rate -- we recognize revenue ratably over 3 years so you have to dilute that in. And that's why what happens is that double-digit bookings rate increase translates when it's diluted with the rest of the backlog that is chugging along steadily flat to effectively a mid-single-digit growth rate in revenue.

I have to say that the strength of our broad and diversified portfolio of leadership technology franchises led to record third quarter revenue for Broadcom despite these uncertain times we continue to operate in. We remain well positioned to address the work-from-home environment, especially with many of our networking and broadband products in the cloud and telcos. In addition, we expect to soon start from benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year. While there continues to be ebb and flow in the parts of our business linked to enterprise, this is somewhat offset by the highly recurring revenue of our infrastructure software divisions. So as a result, we remain confident in the strategy we have laid out over the past several years, delivering sustainable revenue and significant cash flow margins while remaining focused on total shareholder return.
Let me now provide further detail on our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $5.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 1% sequentially and up 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 41% year-on-year, which, of course, does include the contribution from Symantec in 2020.
Starting with semiconductors. Our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially driven by continued strength in networking and broadband. Networking was up 9% sequentially due to continued healthy demand from our cloud customers as we began to ramp for next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products. Routing demand also remains strong as telcos launch our Jericho 2 in the EDGE and core networks. We expect the strength in networking that we have experienced since the beginning of this fiscal year to sustain in Q4, with continued demand from cloud and telcos driving solid sequential growth.
Turning to broadband, which was up 7% sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong demand for the next-generation cable modem DOCSIS 3.1, which was partially offset by a decline in the satellite set-top boxes. We also continue to see strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumer and even in large enterprises. Telecom and consumer have been particularly strong driven by work-from-home environment. But after a strong Q3, we expect the strength in broadband revenue to take a pause and come down on a sequential basis by approximately 10% in Q4. Keep in mind, however, this will still be up 20% on a year-on-year basis.
Moving on, wireless was down 4% sequentially in Q3 due to the expected typical ramp being pushed out this year. This is expected to result in a significant uplift, however, in wireless revenue of approximately 50% sequentially in Q4. Despite this significant sequential ramp and a significant increase in our RF content, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year in Q4. Now this is due to fewer units of our parts for the next-generation phone being shipped in the fourth quarter this year relative to last year due to this product delay. That being said, we currently expect Q1 revenue in wireless to be up sequentially from Q4 with an increase in expected unit shipments of our parts for the next-generation phone compared to Q1 last year. In other words, the launch ramp this year is expected to complete only in Q1 where it's normally been completed in Q4 of previous years.
In server storage connectivity where the majority of the revenue is tied to enterprise, Q3 was up 10% sequentially. However, expected softness in enterprise demand will likely result in server storage revenue declining in high single digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
Turning last to industrial. Resales and revenues were both down 3% sequentially in Q3. In Q4, we expect resales to continue to hold up. However, we are taking the opportunity to further reduce our channel inventory significantly. And as a result, we expect industrial revenue to be down double digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially in Q3. And given the continuing surge of demand in networking and the expected 5G phone ramp in wireless, we expect a mid-teens percentage sequential increase in our fourth fiscal quarter. We should note, on a year-on-year basis, Q4 will mark a return to growth for our semiconductor segment overall, which we think is a key inflection point for Broadcom and which we expect to sustain into Q1.
Now turning to software. CA was up 6% year-on-year, flat sequentially. Bookings at our core accounts continued to grow double digits year-on-year and has offset the expected reduction in the services business. Symantec was flat sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. Similar to CA, bookings in our Symantec core accounts are growing, offsetting the transition out of the smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. Brocade was up 3% year-on-year and, as expected, was down significantly sequentially. Looking ahead to next quarter on a sequential basis, we expect revenues from CA to sustain and expect Symantec revenue to be up 4%. We anticipate Brocade revenue to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And as a result, revenue from the software segment is expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage sequentially in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, we expect our fourth quarter net revenue to be $6.4 billion, up 10% sequentially from Q3. This reflects an approximate mid-teens percentage sequential projected revenue increase in the semiconductor solutions side and a low single-digit percentage sequential revenue increase in infrastructure software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me provide some additional detail on our financial performance.
First, on the P&L, gross margins were a record 74% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 110 basis points from Q2 and up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. The year-on-year increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove a large part of the increase.
Operating income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion and represented 55% of net revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and better gross margin due to mix. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which was down $25 million compared to Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow, we had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 33% year-on-year.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $192 million in withholding taxes due on vesting employee equity, resulting in elimination of approximately 700,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 404 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 451 million in Q4.
On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $1.9 billion in the quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we executed an $8 billion bond refinancing and $3.9 billion exchange offering. Through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, we've been able to push out our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 6 years and reduce our weighted average interest rate to approximately 3%. All told, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of cash and currently have $13.9 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $44 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. Finally, given our strong free cash flow generation and as we look to further deleverage the balance sheet, we plan to pay down an additional $3 billion of debt in our fiscal fourth quarter.
That concludes my prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please open up the call for questions."

Well, again, that's a very interesting question on WiFi 6 because, with regard to WiFi, that's a key franchise we invest a lot of resources into. We're talking about investing considerable dollars, R&D dollars, in this space because we are needed on 2 areas. As you probably know, we supply WiFi, the latest leadership products, in flagship phones, particularly in our strategic North American OEM. We provide all those WiFi/Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area where we have a strong leadership position. We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the current 802.11ax generation in access -- what they call, mention, access gateways. Basically, it's almost like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices, and connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, bring -- basically bring data, video signals into houses -- into your homes.
And in this environment of work from home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes because those terminations, whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL very often terminates in WiFi access gateways that allows the signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know it, WiFi retail route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for the own homes, and that's creating a very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what is a lot -- what a lot of it comprises WiFi 6."

But as you know, pre-COVID-19, as we got into fiscal '20 and the semiconductor industry started to improve, we had indicated and you all inferred, there were certain constraints, supply chain constraints, particularly in regard to wafers, especially leading-edge wafers, leading -- the most advanced node, leading-edge wafers and even then, substrates, particular substrates, that needed to package semiconductors. COVID-19 shows up, just creates a layer of complexity on supply chain. And the reason was, as we indicated 3 months ago, depending on where you outsource -- or where factories are, especially in Asia, parts of Asia, you face situations of lockdowns, operating under capacity.
And we faced them. We faced that for several months. Now that has normalized somewhat in terms of the back end where we have 10 assembly factories that were locked down or running below capacity. Most of that has been resolved. Having said that, the constraint on supply chain, constraint on wafers and substrates continues. And that's what we still face today. And so lead -- to be honest, our lead times are still very extended based on the technology nodes and the particular products that we produce and sell.

But it comes on.
And that's why we put in the R&D to make sure our products create value for customers, each new generation adding more value. And with each generation that we add value, we have the opportunity to extract and ratchet up the value, financial value, for delivering on this much better, higher-performance products. It's a natural cycle. And so with revenue generation, your margin improves. Think about it, we have a range of about 16, 17 broad range of products in various end markets with different product cycles. You do go through that model.

Yes, that's almost -- the simplest way to look at it is we sign software contracts, whether it's on subscription or even on license and maintenance, for a 3-year term contracts, 3 years. So at any point in time, at any 1 year, you're really seeing only roughly 1/3 of our outstanding contract backlog coming up for renewals. And so we -- so for those 1/3 contracts, we are seeing that double-digit booking growth as we renew those contracts, bookings being referred to as renewals of those contracts. So when you take that part, and keep in mind, you still have the other 2/3 backlog that continues, we recognize revenue ratably, very much so.
Every contract we sign up at renewal, we rate -- we recognize revenue ratably over 3 years so you have to dilute that in. And that's why what happens is that double-digit bookings rate increase translates when it's diluted with the rest of the backlog that is chugging along steadily flat to effectively a mid-single-digit growth rate in revenue.

I have to say that the strength of our broad and diversified portfolio of leadership technology franchises led to record third quarter revenue for Broadcom despite these uncertain times we continue to operate in. We remain well positioned to address the work-from-home environment, especially with many of our networking and broadband products in the cloud and telcos. In addition, we expect to soon start from benefiting from the transition to 5G and new product ramps later this year. While there continues to be ebb and flow in the parts of our business linked to enterprise, this is somewhat offset by the highly recurring revenue of our infrastructure software divisions. So as a result, we remain confident in the strategy we have laid out over the past several years, delivering sustainable revenue and significant cash flow margins while remaining focused on total shareholder return.
Let me now provide further detail on our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $5.8 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 1% sequentially and up 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.2 billion, declining 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 41% year-on-year, which, of course, does include the contribution from Symantec in 2020.
Starting with semiconductors. Our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially driven by continued strength in networking and broadband. Networking was up 9% sequentially due to continued healthy demand from our cloud customers as we began to ramp for next-generation Tomahawk 3 and Trident 3 switch products. Routing demand also remains strong as telcos launch our Jericho 2 in the EDGE and core networks. We expect the strength in networking that we have experienced since the beginning of this fiscal year to sustain in Q4, with continued demand from cloud and telcos driving solid sequential growth.
Turning to broadband, which was up 7% sequentially in Q3. We continue to see strong demand for the next-generation cable modem DOCSIS 3.1, which was partially offset by a decline in the satellite set-top boxes. We also continue to see strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumer and even in large enterprises. Telecom and consumer have been particularly strong driven by work-from-home environment. But after a strong Q3, we expect the strength in broadband revenue to take a pause and come down on a sequential basis by approximately 10% in Q4. Keep in mind, however, this will still be up 20% on a year-on-year basis.
Moving on, wireless was down 4% sequentially in Q3 due to the expected typical ramp being pushed out this year. This is expected to result in a significant uplift, however, in wireless revenue of approximately 50% sequentially in Q4. Despite this significant sequential ramp and a significant increase in our RF content, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year in Q4. Now this is due to fewer units of our parts for the next-generation phone being shipped in the fourth quarter this year relative to last year due to this product delay. That being said, we currently expect Q1 revenue in wireless to be up sequentially from Q4 with an increase in expected unit shipments of our parts for the next-generation phone compared to Q1 last year. In other words, the launch ramp this year is expected to complete only in Q1 where it's normally been completed in Q4 of previous years.
In server storage connectivity where the majority of the revenue is tied to enterprise, Q3 was up 10% sequentially. However, expected softness in enterprise demand will likely result in server storage revenue declining in high single digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
Turning last to industrial. Resales and revenues were both down 3% sequentially in Q3. In Q4, we expect resales to continue to hold up. However, we are taking the opportunity to further reduce our channel inventory significantly. And as a result, we expect industrial revenue to be down double digits quarter-over-quarter in Q4.
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 5% sequentially in Q3. And given the continuing surge of demand in networking and the expected 5G phone ramp in wireless, we expect a mid-teens percentage sequential increase in our fourth fiscal quarter. We should note, on a year-on-year basis, Q4 will mark a return to growth for our semiconductor segment overall, which we think is a key inflection point for Broadcom and which we expect to sustain into Q1.
Now turning to software. CA was up 6% year-on-year, flat sequentially. Bookings at our core accounts continued to grow double digits year-on-year and has offset the expected reduction in the services business. Symantec was flat sequentially and contributed over $400 million in the quarter. Similar to CA, bookings in our Symantec core accounts are growing, offsetting the transition out of the smaller commercial accounts as we continue to rationalize the business. Brocade was up 3% year-on-year and, as expected, was down significantly sequentially. Looking ahead to next quarter on a sequential basis, we expect revenues from CA to sustain and expect Symantec revenue to be up 4%. We anticipate Brocade revenue to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And as a result, revenue from the software segment is expected to be up by a low single-digit percentage sequentially in the fourth quarter.
So in summary, we expect our fourth quarter net revenue to be $6.4 billion, up 10% sequentially from Q3. This reflects an approximate mid-teens percentage sequential projected revenue increase in the semiconductor solutions side and a low single-digit percentage sequential revenue increase in infrastructure software.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tom."

Let me provide some additional detail on our financial performance.
First, on the P&L, gross margins were a record 74% of revenue in the quarter and up approximately 110 basis points from Q2 and up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. The year-on-year increase in software as a percentage of our overall revenue drove a large part of the increase.
Operating income from continuing operations was $3.2 billion and represented 55% of net revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 180 basis points quarter-over-quarter and year-on-year, primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and better gross margin due to mix. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, which was down $25 million compared to Q2. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $138 million of depreciation.
Looking at cash flow, we had record quarterly free cash flow of $3.1 billion, representing 53% of revenue. This is up a little more than 33% year-on-year.
Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $192 million in withholding taxes due on vesting employee equity, resulting in elimination of approximately 700,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 404 million outstanding common shares and 451 million fully diluted shares. Note that we expect the fully diluted share count to stay at 451 million in Q4.
On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $1.9 billion in the quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we executed an $8 billion bond refinancing and $3.9 billion exchange offering. Through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, we've been able to push out our weighted average debt maturity to approximately 6 years and reduce our weighted average interest rate to approximately 3%. All told, we ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of cash and currently have $13.9 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $44 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million is short term. Finally, given our strong free cash flow generation and as we look to further deleverage the balance sheet, we plan to pay down an additional $3 billion of debt in our fiscal fourth quarter.

We provide all those WiFi/Bluetooth combo chips, which provides the latest features in those. And that's one area where we have a strong leadership position. We also have a very strong leadership position in WiFi 6, the current 802.11ax generation in access -- what they call, mention, access gateways. Basically, it's almost like home infrastructure, connectivity in the homes, connectivity in the offices, enterprises and offices, and connectivity that's provided now as service providers and telcos bring signals, bring -- basically bring data, video signals into houses -- into your homes.
And in this environment of work from home, we are seeing a strong surge of demand from telcos, service providers as they expand this WiFi service as part of broadband to the homes because those terminations, whether it's cable, fiber or copper DSL very often terminates in WiFi access gateways that allows the signals to be in the home. Also, we're also seeing that many homes, many consumers are themselves upgrading connectivity in their homes by going out and buying retail routers. As we all know it, WiFi retail route is the latest generation, which we are very well featured in for the own homes, and that's creating a very strong surge of demand of what I call broadband and what is a lot -- what a lot of it comprises WiFi 6."

But as you know, pre-COVID-19, as we got into fiscal '20 and the semiconductor industry started to improve, we had indicated and you all inferred, there were certain constraints, supply chain constraints, particularly in regard to wafers, especially leading-edge wafers, leading -- the most advanced node, leading-edge wafers and even then, substrates, particular substrates, that needed to package semiconductors. COVID-19 shows up, just creates a layer of complexity on supply chain. And the reason was, as we indicated 3 months ago, depending on where you outsource -- or where factories are, especially in Asia, parts of Asia, you face situations of lockdowns, operating under capacity.
And we faced them. We faced that for several months. Now that has normalized somewhat in terms of the back end where we have 10 assembly factories that were locked down or running below capacity. Most of that has been resolved. Having said that, the constraint on supply chain, constraint on wafers and substrates continues. And that's what we still face today. And so lead -- to be honest, our lead times are still very extended based on the technology nodes and the particular products that we produce and sell. And given the kind of products we do, we see some of that constraint. And I'll be direct, we could have shipped more in Q3 if such constraints were not as tight."

I mean our capital allocation policy is to allocate approximately half of our free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of the dividend. We've had that in place now for several years, and we think that's the right approach. We're going to continue to take the other 50%, manage the balance sheet as we are this year.
We paid down a considerable amount of debt by the end of this year, $5 billion, which we're happy with. We think the balance sheet is in a very good place as we exited fiscal '20. And then we're back to sort of, I think, a normal behavior in terms of looking at how to drive the total shareholder return above and beyond the dividend, allocating capital, either to M&A and/or to buybacks. And so we'll address the dividend question, as we always do, at the end of the fiscal year but look forward to executing in this quarter, posting results and then having that discussion."

And we come out with them, come out with next-generation products, in a very steady cadence of product life cycle. For instance, in wireless, our products come out every 12, 18 months, a new generation of products; in networking, 2, 3 years; storage, 4, 5 years; industrial, anywhere from 4 to 8 years. But it comes on.
And that's why we put in the R&D to make sure our products create value for customers, each new generation adding more value. And with each generation that we add value, we have the opportunity to extract and ratchet up the value, financial value, for delivering on this much better, higher-performance products. It's a natural cycle. And so with revenue generation, your margin improves. Think about it, we have a range of about 16, 17 broad range of products in various end markets with different product cycles. You do go through that model. What we have seen empirically, over the last 10 years, is the gross margin of this mix of products grows naturally -- expands naturally 50 to 100 basis points each year.

Yes, that's almost -- the simplest way to look at it is we sign software contracts, whether it's on subscription or even on license and maintenance, for a 3-year term contracts, 3 years. So at any point in time, at any 1 year, you're really seeing only roughly 1/3 of our outstanding contract backlog coming up for renewals. And so we -- so for those 1/3 contracts, we are seeing that double-digit booking growth as we renew those contracts, bookings being referred to as renewals of those contracts. So when you take that part, and keep in mind, you still have the other 2/3 backlog that continues, we recognize revenue ratably, very much so.
Every contract we sign up at renewal, we rate -- we recognize revenue ratably over 3 years so you have to dilute that in. And that's why what happens is that double-digit bookings rate increase translates when it's diluted with the rest of the backlog that is chugging along steadily flat to effectively a mid-single-digit growth rate in revenue.

And to showcase our deep bench of talent at Broadcom, starting in fiscal year '21, we plan to organize a series of analyst days on the various businesses where you can hear from our respective general managers about their businesses. And to kick this off, the first will occur this January, where Ram Velaga and Alexis Björlin will review our networking franchise. 
With this, let me now turn to our very strong fourth quarter results. We capped off fiscal 2020 with record quarterly revenue and profitability despite the ongoing pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties. We delivered net revenue of $6.5 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11% sequentially and 12% -- up 12% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion, increasing 6% year-on-year and most notably representing a return to year-on-year revenue growth. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 36% year-on-year, which of course, includes the contribution from Symantec. 
Let me now turn first to semiconductors. Networking, which represented approximately 35% of our semiconductor solution revenue in the quarter was up 17% year-on-year, driven by the continued strength in cloud data center spending as well as continued spending by telcos in upgrading Edge and core networks. 
Moving on to Q1. We expect this trend of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth to continue, even as we expect enterprise campus spending to continue to soften. Turning to broadband, which represented approximately 14% of semiconductor solutions in the quarter. That was up 22% year-on-year. Growth was driven by the work-from-home environment and the need among service providers as well as consumers to upgrade broadband connectivity, too, as well as within the home. 
We experienced strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumers. In fact, in this environment, WiFi, where we are very well positioned as a leader, has turned into a substantial and growing business for the company. Beyond WiFi, we also experienced strong investment by service providers in GPON, that's fiber-to-the-home and digital subscriber line copper, as well as cable modems among the cable operators. All this more than offset a decline in video. We expect low to mid-teens percentage year-on-year growth -- revenue growth in broadband for Q1 as demand continues to remain strong. 
Moving on. Wireless revenue, which represented approximately 31% of semiconductor revenue in this quarter was up 43% sequentially in Q4 with the launch of new generation flagship phone by a large North American OEM customer. Still, this was down 9% year-on-year, given the 1-quarter delay in the ramp of production of that program. Accordingly, we expect Q1 fiscal '21 to now be the peak quarter of this seasonal ramp, and revenue will compare extremely favorably with the same quarter a year ago, and we expect that to be up over 50% year-on-year. 
Turning to server storage connectivity that represented approximately 14% of Q4 semiconductor revenue and was down 9% year-on-year, as expected, reflecting softness in enterprise demand. Turning to Q1. We expect revenue to continue to decline, and given the strong Q1 compare in fiscal '20, we expect this to be down double digits even as much as perhaps 20%. 
Last, turning to industrial, which represented approximately 3% of Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue. We're seeing demand recovering, especially out of China and consolidated resales, and here, we sell through distributors, of course, were up 4% year-on-year. And we forecast such resales in Q1 to start -- to accelerate to mid-teens year-on-year growth as the recovery in industrial and auto continues. 
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, driven primarily by the ramp in wireless as well as continued strength, networking and broadband. Forecasting Q1, we expect this ramp in wireless to peak and broadband and networking demand to remain strong. This will drive revenue in the semiconductor segment to increase in Q1 by high teens percentage year-on-year. 
Turning to software. Let me reiterate our business model here. We focus, as we have said many times, only on the largest enterprise customers and seek to increase the adoption of the software products to a hybrid model, about 90% of which are recurring subscription revenue. We have stepped up investment in R&D focused on just these core customers. And we are able to do that by spending much less on our go-to-market outside of our large core enterprise customers unlike, obviously, the other software companies who are chasing every last dollar of revenue no matter how much it costs. 
So let me tell you, with 2 years of CA under our belt, let me tell you how we have done. Revenue-wise, after 2 years integrating CA onto our platform, Q4 '20 revenue was up 5% year-on-year. For Symantec, if you exclude services and hardware, Q4 product revenue of $380 million was up 10% from Q1 fiscal '20, which was obviously our first quarter after acquisition. But if we just look at revenue from our core accounts in CA, this was, in fact, up double digits, closer to 12% year-on-year, driven by bookings which have continued to grow double digits on an annualized basis. 
This is obviously -- this growth in core accounts has obviously more than offset the plain decline in services and attrition of accounts outside our core enterprise customers. That's how we expect to sustain our core software business long term, albeit at low to mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth. But we intend to drive to a financial outcome that is consistent with the Broadcom model. You'll hear more on that from Kirsten when she talks about our financial model. 
So looking ahead to next quarter, on a year-on-year basis, we expect CA and Symantec software revenue to continue to grow in the mid-single digits. However, in Q1 fiscal '21, we expect Brocade to decline high single digits, consistent with softness in enterprise markets, resulting in our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat to perhaps up low single-digit percentage year-over-year. 
In summary, we expect Q1 consolidated net revenue of $6.6 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year, all derived organically. Today, we are in a unique situation. We started fiscal 2021 with record backlog that has now grown to over $14 billion today. But the timing of this conversion of backlog to revenue won't be driven by a supply chain, which continues to be tight. 
Finally, I want to take the opportunity here to thank our team for all their work in fiscal 2020. This has undoubtedly been a challenging year, and through it all, all of our employees have demonstrated unwavering focus and resilience. Because of their hard work, our mission-critical technologies have never been more relevant than they are today. And with that, let me turn you over to Kirsten."

By way of background, while I've been a part of Broadcom for more than 6 years, my history in accounting and reporting roles from legacy companies, Avago and LSI, dates back over 20 years. I'm proud of the strong finance organization that Broadcom has built and I look forward to working together. 
I know Hock just gave you the details on revenue, which I'll recap before moving down the P&L to discuss our fourth quarter performance, which clearly demonstrates our strong foundation for future growth. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.5 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion and represented 75% of our total revenue this quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.6 billion and represented 25% of revenue. This was up 36% year-on-year, given the inclusion of Symantec. 
Continuing down the P&L. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, up approximately 370 basis points year-on-year. The expansion in gross margin year-on-year was driven by favorable product mix in semiconductors and a higher percentage of software revenue. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 10% year-on-year due primarily to the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.6 billion and represented 56% of revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 400 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 billion and represented 59% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation. 
Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68% in Q4, up 320 basis points year-over-year, driven by an improved product mix. This mix included more networking products and less wireless. As you know, wireless carries around 10 points less margin on product profitability than the rest of our semiconductor portfolio. 
Operating expenses were $777 million in Q4 or 16% of semiconductor solutions revenue compared to $727 million in the prior year period as we continued to invest in our business. R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 14% and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 2%. Operating margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were 52% in Q4, up 290 basis points year-on-year. All told, in semiconductor solutions, revenue was up 6% and operating profit grew 12%. 
Gross margins for our infrastructure software segment were 90% in Q4, up 130 basis points year-over-year. Cost of revenue primarily includes cost of product support, hosting for our SaaS products, professional services and hardware. Operating expenses were $338 million in Q4 or 21% of infrastructure software revenue compared to $290 million or 24% of revenue in the prior year period as we generate scale through the acquisition of Symantec. 
R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 12%, and SG&A as a percentage of infrastructure software revenue was 9%. Operating margin was 69% in Q4, up 480 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margins reflect our model, which is about focusing on the largest enterprise customers and increasing our share of their wallet in terms of our software portfolio. Given this model, we are able to focus our R&D investments on a strategic group of customers and by doing so, reduce costs primarily on go-to-market. This is how we get to operating margin of about 69%, which we believe we can sustain. 
Looking at cash flow. We had quarterly free cash flow of $3.2 billion, representing 50% of revenue. This is up 36% year-on-year as we managed our working capital more tightly during this pandemic. 
Moving on to capital allocation for Q4. We paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $185 million of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 500,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 407 million outstanding common shares and 451 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 450 million in Q1. 
On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $3 billion in the quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion of cash and currently have $12.6 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $41.1 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million in short term. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Our revenue hit a new record of $23.9 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $6.6 billion, which included $1.5 billion from Brocade, which was down 17% year-on-year. $3.5 billion from CA, which was up 4% year-on-year and the addition of Symantec, which is $1.6 billion. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high of 73.5%, up from 71% a year ago. The addition of Symantec as well as a beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. Additionally, operating expenses were $4.6 billion, which included the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 54% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $570 million in depreciation. 
We accrued $644 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $583 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in fiscal 2020. We spent $463 million on capital expenditures and free cash flow represented 49% of revenue or $11.6 billion. Free cash flow grew 25% year-over-year. 
Now on to capital allocation. For the year, we returned $6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $5.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $800 million for the elimination of 2.6 million AVGO shares. We also paid [ $299 million ] in dividends to our preferred stockholders. I would also note through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, our weighted average debt maturity is now approximately 6 years with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, we remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year normalized free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $12 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year 2020, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.60 per share. This constitutes an increase of 11% and assumes a basic outstanding share count of [ 413 million ] shares at the end of fiscal 2021. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout this year, subject to quarterly Board approval. 
Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '21 free cash flow results. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bea."

And the investment, we -- the cadence of the investment we're doing continues in areas that we see as very strategic in various businesses.

And the investment, we -- the cadence of the investment we're doing continues in areas that we see as very strategic in various businesses. And you've seen some of that coming out as we continue to do so. For instance, last week, we announced the introduction and ramp -- and introduction availability of the -- our 800-gig platform for switching, routing and interconnects in the basic [indiscernible] and all that, that goes hand-in-hand with it. So all about launching 800-gig platform and that comes in the form of our new product, Tomahawk 4. 
And it's pretty interesting that we're launching it now because our previous generation which is at 400-gig platform, Tomahawk 3, which we introduced over a year ago, [ of course ], 1.5 years ago, is just starting to ramp [indiscernible] in terms -- into a larger market. And we are already launching an 800-gig. So the speed and the regularity and the speed at which we are pushing this product is definitely something we intend to keep 
We're coming out with a newer generation, probably that is probably 2x throughput capacity and the regularity of 18 months to 2 years on a consistent basis because that's what our hyper cloud customers want. And it makes sense because we need to scale up data centers as CPUs start to hit the limitation And that's 1 example. 
As part of that, as we indicated a year ago, we're stepping our investment in areas of silicon photonics, basically to enable interconnects at very high throughput and very high bandwidth. And that's been going very, very well. It's a multiyear investment. And as we indicated from the last time we talked about it, we are now only on the second year. But we expect to have something that will make -- that will be out to the marketplace within a generation or 2 of our platforms in switching and routing. And that's on that aspect of it. 
In terms of further investments, we have stepped up investment, as I indicated in my report, on WiFi, on connectivity of 802.11ax now. And we launched that platform 2 years ago, very successful. And we're already working on and we have invested a lot on the next-generation WiFi 7, successor to this WiFi 6. In between, we're putting out 6-gigahertz WiFi, that's WiFi 6E, which is the spectrum bandwidth recently was approved by the FCC not long ago. 
And we already have our first product certified by the FCC recently. We're the first out there. So we intend to be in the lead, for instance, in this wireless connectivity, which by the way, today, as I indicated, represents a very substantial and growing part of our business. And it's a testimonial to the reliable investment and success we've gotten in this area. And so these are some of the things that we have. And most of this investment are multiyear, but you do start to see some of the bands, some of the products, some of the launches, some of the revenues starting to come in with this level of investments we are making in here."

Just what steps are you taking to make sure it doesn't constrain growth? And also on the other side, make sure customers are not double ordering because of all these supply issues?"

We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact, probably even earlier than that. We have seen -- probably even 2 quarters ago, we have seen that",621,"Well, interesting question. We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact, probably even earlier than that. We have seen -- probably even 2 quarters ago, we have seen that supply constraint. And we were one of first to report on it. And that supply constraint continues from when we first touched on it 6 months ago. And it's -- in some area, it just seems to revolve in different specific areas, where it is. 
We talked about wafers then. Since then, as you correctly pointed out, and we hear it in the news, substrate is a consideration. And believe me, beyond that, wire-bonding is even a possible constraint depending on whether like it, more and more automotive legacy products coming in. So we operate in an environment, and I mentioned in my remarks, that it's fairly unique. Here, we are in the middle of a pandemic. Here, we are where there are winners and losers even in the product lines, even in the industry we're in, where there are some businesses where demand is just booming. And we touched on that in networking, in broadband and some areas, particularly in enterprise, where they're not so strong. 
But what we also see is supply -- a capacity from our supply chain that is tight, that's what we're doing. And we have seen that for months, and we have taken a lot of actions to have address it and we continue to do that. We're also one of the largest consumer of those third-party manufacturers in semiconductors out there, be they wafers, be they substrates, be they back-end assembly or test capacity. We are all in there and we've been seeing it for 6 months. So best answer is we're managing that. 
We have -- having said that, we have the backlog in place. And we have also, very early on in our fiscal '20, stretched out a supply chain, not only based on what we're seeing but based on what we anticipate happening. And that has also enabled us to be able to -- in a more orderly manner in what I consider a more appropriate manner, put products in the hands of end users who need it at the appropriate time. We've done that very well. 
And having said all that, even as we do it, our backlog continues to grow. To give you a sense, I mentioned we have $14 billion -- over $14 billion of backlog today. When we started the quarter, our backlog and we're shipping in between and since then, beginning of the quarter, our backlog was $12 billion. So it's accelerating. But having said that, please don't get carried away in the other aspect. 
As you know, wireless business that we have is seasonal so we are seeing, obviously, wireless -- our wireless backlog is a significant part of a total backlog. But given the seasonality of it, we obviously have seen a deceleration in the bookings that are coming in from our wireless business. But we are seeing, on the other side, acceleration and continued strength in orders coming in from the other parts of our business. Networking has always remained strong. Broadband continues to be very strong. And now we start to see the smaller part of our business, industrial coming in very, very strong. 
So 1 side is offsetting the other and we continue to see this strong backlog, which in a way makes our planning in our supply chain easiest, but in some ways, poses other challenges of making sure we are delivering products to the right consumer -- customers at the right time."

And we do not see a slowdown in the demand. And you're correct. Operator -- service provider and operators are also adopting this merchant silicon routing platforms on your networks, as I mentioned, particularly in as well as edge. And we're seeing extreme -- very, very good demand and success as evidenced by the backlog and orders we are getting from service providers and not just hyper cloud, particularly service providers on our merchant silicon Jericho family. 
So that's good. And do I see that continuing? Probably as far as you can see, '21. We have -- our lead times is now beyond 6 months. That answers your question. So -- and just to add further we have a policy in this company that we -- and adhere to very, very strictly, both because of financial governance. Any orders placed on us, do not -- we do not allow to be canceled. All our customers know that. All our partners know that. So we're actually seeing real demand out there at least 6 months. 
And that brings us pretty close to the second or that brings us in fact to the second half of fiscal '21 at that point.

But in the way you ask in respect of wireless, you're correct also in pointing out, when we do year-on-year comparisons now, it's very interesting because the Q4 fiscal '20, the quarter we just finished and reporting on becomes the first quarterly ramp of our wireless business, and it compares to Q4 fiscal '19 which in typical cycles in the past is you see the peak quarter of revenue seasonally for our wireless business. So you're comparing an initial ramp against a peak quarter. And that's down, as I indicated, 9% year-on-year. 
The big ramp now for this current generation of phones in our wireless business will be our Q1, the quarter we are in now. And that compares to the Q1 of fiscal '20 now, which is post peak red of the last generation, which is why I also indicated, we're likely to see -- around a 50% year-on-year step up in our wireless revenue. Now we go into Q2, and I think people probably things get back to more normalcy, and as always, expect wireless to demonstrate a seasonality as probably the bottom quarter of an annual cycle."

I guess I want to ask some of the questions around the management change and specifically, Tom's new position. I'm just kind of curious what that might mean for the software infrastructure business longer term? And whether or not there's any sort of plan to potentially actually spin that business out. And I asked the question because clearly, when you look at the core IP you have in your silicon business around IO, around acceleration and how important those IP blocks are, when you look at the sum of the part valuation of overall Broadcom, it just looks dirt cheap. 
You've doubled the operating margins in the software businesses since you acquired those companies, and you've got great franchises in silicon and yet you're trading at a big discount. Is there a belief that perhaps the best way to get value longer term for these businesses might be a spin? And is that part of the rationale behind Tom's new position?"

But no, there's no plan. I think it's just that the software businesses, especially go-to-market is a very interesting play for this company because Broadcom as a whole, and you look at us, we have around $20 billion, $25 billion roughly, give or take, a few billion in revenues, each 1 year. 
We're a technology company, the out there, technology suppliers to an ecosystem. And by that, I mean, an ecosystem addresses end users, be they hypercloud, be they service providers or be they basic large -- while we tend to focus large enterprises out there, like the banks, insurance companies, travel agency, whatever the end user. We look at this as our eventual end-use customers. That's our ecosystem. And it's deeper ecosystem. We have partners with the OEMs, some distributors, but largely, our key partners are on the OEMs and these are our partners. 
These are, in a way, important partners that we often sell our products with and through. We look at it that way. So when you look at it that way, end-use software, infrastructure software, it's no different than the silicon solutions, hardware and software tied to it that we sell out there. It's just that we tend to sell silicon software through partners, with partners who in the system and go to end users versus infrastructure software. Why we tend to go direct, though not all the time. Sometimes we go with MS service providers like IBM, GTS or DXC that sells it too. But ultimately, those end users who uses our software. 
And we look at ecosystem that way, it makes total logical sense that we have a unified platform that does everything across. Because at the end of the day, we are still fulfilling to the same end users, whether they are semiconductor hardware solutions, with software developer kit, SDK or other operating system or straight infrastructure software, some with that system I could add. And so to us, long term is very logical. They stay together."

And as Hock's talked about, we've got a decent amount of visibility in the first half, and we'll see what happens in the second half. But it seems like the year is set up for a reasonable amount of success. 
And so I think with that in mind, we're comfortable with our investment-grade credit rating. We have delevered. We paid down $3 billion of debt in Q4. We're upping the dividend, as you mentioned, and sticking to the policy of giving back about 50% of free cash flow. So that's going to leave us with some excess cash. And we always look at it as what are the right relative returns and what's best for shareholders, and that usually means buying back stock or doing M&A. And I think we'll certainly look at doing both. We're biased toward acquisitions historically, and I think we'll continue to be so as long as we can find the right targets and generate the right returns consistent with our business model. So I'd really say business as usual on those."

As you noticed, in addition to giving full P&L, almost full P&L [indiscernible] is because there's also some amount of allocation. But we try to be very representative of our 2 large -- of our 2 segments, semiconductors and infrastructure software. 
You will notice that we've been especially in semiconductors, we gave you a lot now more color and breakdown on what drives -- which are the particular end market applications in semiconductors and the behavior and the dynamics in each of those verticals. And something we understand, we have been perhaps more lacking in the past, which we try to remedy now by giving you guys much more details. 
And it's also, in this particular environment, it is very, very important. I think we give it because I cannot say that all cylinders are firing like crazy because as you all know, we all know, no, in this environment [indiscernible] some cylinders. And as we indicated very there are some areas where we're very -- it's performing very, very well. And it's performing very well, I should quickly hasten to add, not because we are super good in it, which we are, but we're also super good in the other areas that are not performing as well also. It's just the economy, the macroeconomy, the demand and unusual situation we're all in. And so we felt it is appropriate to give you guys more specifics. 
What's driving the overall revenue and what has changed because as I also indicated in my last earnings call, when we began this year, we had a certain set of expectations, which has dramatically changed now that we finished the year. I expect -- I had expected semiconductor as an industry to recover from downturns of 2019, obviously, and that 2020 will be a slow, steady recovery, accelerating into the back end. 
What we didn't expect is in actual numbers, it did recover but not everything recovered. And it's -- in a sense, it's a response to the requirements, the situation of a pandemic and a work-from-home environment. And so we see those businesses that are doing superbly. 
And to really explain it, we felt we had to give you more disclosures in which we are. And if we start giving you disclosure and ask if you go all the way and show you what, even how the segment -- the 2 broad segment P&L look like. And one of the other things we want to also demonstrate to you guys loud and clear is that we have a business model in mind  [indiscernible] this investment thesis when we go and bind these specific software companies, some of which may not be in favor when we bought them.

But while you often see me and Tom, behind us, we have a very strong bench that has gotten us to where we are today. So today, we are elevating some of this deep bench into critical positions that will strengthen our organization going forward. Tom, Charlie and Kirsten are among the people who sustain the platform and make the phenomenal numbers I'm about to announce happen.

And to kick this off, the first will occur this January, where Ram Velaga and Alexis Björlin will review our networking franchise. 
With this, let me now turn to our very strong fourth quarter results. We capped off fiscal 2020 with record quarterly revenue and profitability despite the ongoing pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties. We delivered net revenue of $6.5 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11% sequentially and 12% -- up 12% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion, increasing 6% year-on-year and most notably representing a return to year-on-year revenue growth. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 36% year-on-year, which of course, includes the contribution from Symantec. 
Let me now turn first to semiconductors. Networking, which represented approximately 35% of our semiconductor solution revenue in the quarter, was up 17% year-on-year, driven by the continued strength in cloud data center spending as well as continued spending by telcos in upgrading Edge and core networks. Moving on to Q1, we expect this trend of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth to continue even as we expect enterprise campus spending to continue to soften. 
Turning to broadband, which represented approximately 14% of semiconductor solutions in the quarter. That was up 22% year-on-year. Growth was driven by the work-from-home environment and the need among service providers as well as consumers to upgrade broadband connectivity, too, as well as within the home. We experienced strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumers. In fact, in this environment, WiFi, where we are very well positioned as a leader, has turned into a substantial and growing business for the company. Beyond WiFi, we also experienced strong investment by service providers in GPON, that's fiber-to-the-home, and digital subscriber line copper as well as cable modems among the cable operators. All this more than offset a decline in video. We expect low to mid-teens percentage year-on-year growth -- revenue growth in broadband for Q1 as demand continues to remain strong. 
Moving on. Wireless revenue, which represented approximately 31% of semiconductor revenue in this quarter, was up 43% sequentially in Q4 with the launch of new generation flagship phone by a large North American OEM customer. Still, this was down 9% year-on-year given the 1-quarter delay in the ramp of production of that program. Accordingly, we expect Q1 fiscal '21 to now be the peak quarter of this seasonal ramp, and revenue will compare extremely favorably with the same quarter a year ago, and we expect that to be up over 50% year-on-year. 
Turning to server storage connectivity that represented approximately 14% of Q4 semiconductor revenue -- and was down 9% year-on-year, as expected, reflecting softness in enterprise demand. Turning to Q1, we expect revenue to continue to decline. And given the strong Q1 compare in fiscal '20, we expect this to be down double digits even as much as perhaps 20%. 
Last, turning to industrial, which represented approximately 3% of Q4 semiconductor solution revenue. We're seeing demand recovery especially out of China. And consolidated resales -- and here, we sell through distributors, of course, were up 4% year-on-year. And we forecast such resales in Q1 to start -- to accelerate to mid-teens year-on-year growth as the recovery in industrial and auto continues. 
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, driven primarily by the ramp in wireless as well as continued strength in networking and broadband. Forecasting Q1, we expect this ramp in wireless to peak, and broadband and networking demand to remain strong. This will drive revenue in the semiconductor segment to increase in Q1 by high-teens percentage year-on-year. 
Turning to software. Let me reiterate our business model here. We focus, as we have said many times, only on the largest enterprise customers and seek to increase the adoption of the software products to a hybrid model, about 90% of which are recurring subscription revenue. We have stepped up investment in R&D focused on just these core customers. And we are able to do that by spending much less on our go-to-market outside of our large core enterprise customers unlike obviously the other software companies who are chasing every last dollar of revenue no matter how much it costs. 
So let me tell you -- with 2 years of CA under our belt, let me tell you how we have done. Revenue-wise, after 2 years integrating CA onto our platform, Q4 '20 revenue was up 5% year-on-year. For Symantec, if you exclude services and hardware, Q4 product revenue of $380 million was up 10% from Q1 fiscal '20, which was obviously our first quarter after acquisition. But if we just look at revenue from our core accounts in CA, this was in fact up double digits, closer to 12% year-on-year, driven by bookings which have continued to grow double digits on an annualized basis. This is obviously -- this growth in core accounts has obviously more than offset the plain decline in services and attrition of accounts outside our core enterprise customers. That's how we expect to sustain our core software business long term albeit at low to mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth. But we intend to drive to a financial outcome that is consistent with the Broadcom model. You'll hear more on that from Kirsten when she talks about our financial model. 
So looking ahead to next quarter, on a year-on-year basis, we expect CA and Symantec software revenue to continue to grow in the mid-single digits. However, in Q1 fiscal '21, we expect Brocade to decline high single digits, consistent with softness in enterprise markets, resulting in our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat to perhaps up low single-digit percentage year-over-year. 
In summary, we expect Q1 consolidated net revenue of $6.6 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year, all derived organically. Today, we are in a unique situation. We started fiscal 2021 with record backlog that has now grown to over $14 billion today. But the timing of this conversion of backlog to revenue won't be driven by a supply chain which continues to be tight. 
Finally, I want to take the opportunity here to thank our team for all their work in fiscal 2020. This has undoubtedly been a challenging year, and through it all, all of our employees have demonstrated unwavering focus and resilience. Because of their hard work, our mission-critical technologies have never been more relevant than they are today. 
And with that, let me turn you over to Kirsten."

By way of background, while I've been a part of Broadcom for more than 6 years, my history in accounting and reporting roles from legacy companies, Avago and LSI, dates back over 20 years. I'm proud of the strong finance organization that Broadcom has built and I look forward to working together. 
I know Hock just gave you the details on revenue, which I'll recap before moving down the P&L to discuss our fourth quarter performance, which clearly demonstrates our strong foundation for future growth. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.5 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion and represented 75% of our total revenue this quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.6 billion and represented 25% of revenue. This was up 36% year-on-year given the inclusion of Symantec. 
Continuing down the P&L. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, up approximately 370 basis points year-on-year. The expansion in gross margin year-on-year was driven by favorable product mix in semiconductors and a higher percentage of software revenue. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 10% year-on-year due primarily to the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.6 billion and represented 56% of revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 400 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 billion and represented 59% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation. 
Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68% in Q4, up 320 basis points year-over-year, driven by an improved product mix. This mix included more networking products and less wireless. As you know, wireless carries around 10 points less margin on product profitability than the rest of our semiconductor portfolio. Operating expenses were $777 million in Q4 or 16% of semiconductor solutions revenue compared to $727 million in the prior year period as we continued to invest in our business. R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 14%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 2%. Operating margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were 52% in Q4, up 290 basis points year-on-year. All told, in semiconductor solutions, revenue was up 6% and operating profit grew 12%. 
Gross margins for our infrastructure software segment were 90% in Q4, up 130 basis points year-over-year. Cost of revenue primarily includes cost of product support, hosting for our SaaS products, professional services and hardware. Operating expenses were $338 million in Q4 or 21% of infrastructure software revenue compared to $290 million or 24% of revenue in the prior year period as we generate scale through the acquisition of Symantec. R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 12%, and SG&A as a percentage of infrastructure software revenue was 9%. Operating margin was 69% in Q4, up 480 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margins reflect our model which is about focusing on the largest enterprise customers and increasing our share of their wallet in terms of our software portfolio. Given this model, we are able to focus our R&D investments on a strategic group of customers and, by doing so, reduce costs primarily on go-to-market. This is how we get to operating margin of about 69%, which we believe we can sustain. 
Looking at cash flow. We had quarterly free cash flow of $3.2 billion, representing 50% of revenue. This is up 36% year-on-year as we managed our working capital more tightly during this pandemic. 
Moving on to capital allocation for Q4. We paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $185 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 500,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 407 million outstanding common shares and 451 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 450 million in Q1. On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $3 billion in the quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion of cash and currently have $12.6 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $41.1 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million in short term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Our revenue hit a new record of $23.9 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $6.6 billion, which included $1.5 billion from Brocade, which was down 17% year-on-year; $3.5 billion from CA, which was up 4% year-on-year; and the addition of Symantec, which was $1.6 billion. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high of 73.5%, up from 71% a year ago. The addition of Symantec as well as a beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. Additionally, operating expenses were $4.6 billion, which included the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 54% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $570 million in depreciation. We accrued $644 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $583 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in fiscal 2020. We spent $463 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 49% of revenue or $11.6 billion. Free cash flow grew 25% year-over-year. 
Now on to capital allocation. For the year, we returned $6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $5.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $800 million for the elimination of 2.6 million AVGO shares. We also paid $299 million in dividends to our preferred stockholders. I would also note through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, our weighted average debt maturity is now approximately 6 years with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, we remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year normalized free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $12 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year 2020, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.60 per share. This constitutes an increase of 11% and assumes a basic outstanding share count of 413 million shares at the end of fiscal 2021. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout this year, subject to quarterly Board approval. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '21 free cash flow results. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bea."

And the investment, we -- the cadence of the investment we're doing continues in areas that we see as very strategic in various businesses. And you've seen some of that coming out as we continue to do so. For instance, last week, we announced the introduction and ramp -- and introduction availability of the -- our 800-gig platform for switching, routing and interconnects in the basic size, retimers and all that, that goes hand in hand with it. So all about launching 800-gig platform and that comes in the form of our new product, Tomahawk 4. 
And it's pretty interesting that we're launching it now because our previous generation, which is at 400-gig platform, Tomahawk 3, which we introduced over a year ago, of course 1.5 years ago, is just starting to ramp. We then will have -- in terms -- into a larger market. And we're already launching an 800 gig. So the speed and -- the regularity and the speed at which we are pushing this product is definitely something we intend to keep. We're coming out with a newer generation. Probably -- that is probably 2x throughput capacity and the regularity of 18 months to 2 years on a consistent basis because that's what our hyper cloud customers want. And it makes sense because we need to scale up data centers as CPUs start to hit the limitation of the Moore's Law. Now that's one example. 
As part of that, as we indicated a year ago, we're stepping our investment in areas of silicon photonics basically to enable interconnects at very high throughput, at very high bandwidth. And that's been going very, very well. It's a multiyear investment. And as we indicated from the last time we talked about it, we are now only on the second year, but we expect to have something that will make -- that will be out to the marketplace within a generation or 2 of our platforms in switching and routing. And that's on that aspect of it. 
In terms of further investments, we have stepped up investment, as I indicated in my report, on WiFi, on connectivity of base 802.11ax now. And we launched that platform 2 years ago, very successful. And we're already working on -- and we have invested a lot on the next-generation WiFi 7, successor to this WiFi 6. In between, we're putting out 6-gigahertz WiFi, that's WiFi 6E, which is the spectrum bandwidth recently was approved by the FCC not long ago. And we already have our first product certified by the FCC recently. We're the first out there. So we intend to be in the lead, for instance, in this wireless connectivity, which by the way, today, as I indicated, represents a very substantial and growing part of our business. And it's a testimonial to the reliable investment and success we've gotten in this area. 
And so these are some of the things that we have. And most of this investment are multiyear, but you do start to see some of the bands, some of the products, some of the launches, some of the revenues starting to come in with this level of investments we are making in here."

We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact probably even earlier than that.

We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact probably even earlier than that. We have seen -- probably even 2 quarters ago, we have seen that supply constraint. And we were one of first to report on it. And that supply constraint continues from when we first touched on it 6 months ago. And it's -- in some area, it just seems to revolve in different specific areas, where it is. We talked about wafers then -- since then, as you correctly pointed out. And we hear in the news substrate is a consideration. And believe me, beyond that, wire-bonding is even a possible constraint depending on whether -- like it's more and more automotive legacy products come in. 
So we operate in an environment -- and I mentioned in my remarks that it's fairly unique. Here, we are in the middle of a pandemic. Here, we are where there are winners and losers even in the product lines, even in the industry we're in, where there are some businesses where demand is just booming. And we touched on that in networking, in broadband and some areas, particularly in enterprise, where they're not so strong. But what we also see is supply -- a capacity from our supply chain that is tight. That's what we're doing. And we have seen that for months, and we have taken a lot of actions to have address it and we continue to do that. We're also one of the largest consumer of those third-party manufacturers in semiconductors out there, be they wafers, be they substrates, be they back-end assembly or test capacity. We are all in there and we've been seeing it for 6 months. 
So best answer is we're managing that. We have -- having said that, we have the backlog in place. And we have also, very early on in our fiscal '20, stretched out a supply chain not only based on what we're seeing but based on what we anticipate happening. And that has also enabled us to be able to, in a more orderly manner, in what I consider a more appropriate manner, put products in the hands of end users who need it at the appropriate time. We've done that very well. And having said all that, even as we do it, our backlog continues to grow. To give you a sense, I mentioned we have $14 billion -- over $14 billion of backlog today. When we started the quarter, our backlog -- and we're shipping in between since then, beginning of the quarter, our backlog was $12 billion. So it's accelerating. 
But having said that, please don't get carried away in the other aspect. As you know, wireless business that we have is seasonal. So we are seeing -- obviously, wireless -- our wireless backlog is a significant part of a total backlog. But given the seasonality of it, we obviously have seen a deceleration in the bookings that are coming in from our wireless business. But we are seeing, on the other side, acceleration and continued strength in orders coming in from the other parts of our business. Networking has always remained strong. Broadband continues to be very strong. And now we start to see the smaller part of our business, industrial, coming in very, very strong. So one side is offsetting the other, and we continue to see this strong backlog, which in a way makes our planning in our supply chain easiest but in some ways poses other challenges of making sure we are delivering products to the right consumer -- customers at the right time."

And we do not see a slowdown in the demand. And you're correct. Operator -- service provider and operators are also adopting these merchant silicon in the routing platforms on their networks, as I mentioned, particularly in core as well as Edge. And we're seeing extreme -- very, very good demand and success, as evidenced by the backlog and orders we are getting from service providers and not just hyper cloud, particularly service providers on our merchant silicon Jericho family. So that's good. And do I see that continuing? Probably as far as you can see, '21. We have -- our lead times is now beyond 6 months to answer your question. 
So -- and just to add a further thought, we have a policy in this company that we -- and adhere to very, very strictly for both -- because of financial governance, any orders placed on us do not -- we do not allow to be canceled. All our customers know that. All our partners know that. So we're actually seeing real demand out there at least 6 months. And that brings us pretty close to the second -- to the -- or that brings us in fact to the second half of fiscal '21 at that point and, I guess as many of you will know, just in time for the beginning of a seasonal ramp of the next-generation wireless products.

But in the way you ask in respect of wireless, you're correct also in pointing out when we do year-on-year comparisons now, it's very interesting because the Q4 fiscal '20, the quarter we just finished and reporting on, becomes the first quarterly ramp of our wireless business, and it compares to Q4 fiscal '19, which in typical cycles in the past is you see the peak quarter of revenue seasonally for our wireless business. So you're comparing an initial ramp against a peak quarter. And that's down, as I indicated, 9% year-on-year.  
The big ramp now for this current generation of phones in our wireless business will be our Q1, the quarter we are in now. And that compares to the Q1 of fiscal '20 now, which is post big ramp of the last generation, which is why I also indicated we're likely to see a 50 -- around a 50% year-on-year step-up in our wireless revenue. Now we go on to Q2 -- and I think people -- probably things get back to more normalcy, and as always, expect wireless to demonstrate a seasonally -- seasonality as probably the bottom quarter of an annual cycle."

And I asked the question because clearly, when you look at the core IP you have in your silicon business around I/O, around acceleration and how important those IP blocks are, when you look at the sum of the part valuation of overall Broadcom, it just looks dirt cheap. You've doubled the operating margins in the software businesses since you acquired those companies and you've got great franchises in silicon and yet you're trading at a big discount. Is there a belief that perhaps the best way to get value longer term for these businesses might be a spin? And is that part of the rationale behind Tom's new position?"

But no, there's no plan. I think it's just that the software businesses, especially go-to-market, is a very interesting play for this company because Broadcom as a whole -- and you look at us, we have around $20 billion, $25 billion roughly, give or take, a few billion in revenues, each 1 year. We're a technology company, purveyors out there, technology suppliers to an ecosystem. And by that, I mean an ecosystem addresses end users, be they hyper cloud, be they service providers or be they basic, large -- while we tend to focus large enterprises out there, like the banks, insurance companies, travel agency, whatever the end user. We look at this as our eventual end-use customers. That's our ecosystem. And as key product ecosystem, we have partners with the OEMs, some distributors, but largely, our key partners are on the OEMs. And these are our partners. These are, in a way, important partners that we often sell our products with and through. We look at it that way. 
So when you look at it that way, end-use software, infrastructure software, it's no different than the silicon solutions, hardware and software tied to it that we sell out there. It's just that we tend to sell silicon software through partners, with partners who wrap in a system and go to end users versus infrastructure software where we tend to go direct though not all the time. Sometimes, we go with [ MS GS ], service providers like IBM, GTS or DXC that sells it through, but ultimately, those end users who uses our software. And we look at ecosystem that way, it makes total logical sense that we have a unified platform that does everything across. Because at the end of the day, we are still fulfilling to the same end users, whether they are semiconductor hardware solutions with software developer kit, SDK, or other operating system or straight infrastructure software, some with appliances too, I could add. And so that, to me -- to us, long term is very logical. They stay together."

We're biased toward acquisitions historically, and I think we'll continue to be so as long as we can find the right targets and generate the right returns consistent with our business model.

We're doing it because we feel that we should give more disclosures, more specifics of our various businesses. As you noticed, in addition to giving full P&L, almost full P&L to the extent there is, because there's also some amount of allocation. But we try to be very representative of our 2 large -- of our 2 segments, semiconductors and infrastructure software. 
You will notice that we've been -- especially in semiconductors, we give you a lot now more color and breakdown on what drives, what -- which are the particular end-market applications in semiconductors and the behavior and the dynamics in each of those verticals. And something we understand, we have been perhaps more lacking in the past, which we try to remedy now by giving you guys much more details. 
And it's also -- in this particular environment, it is very, very important. I think we give it because I cannot say that all cylinders are firing like crazy because as you all know, we all know, they're not in this environment. We have some cylinders -- and as we indicated very [ lastly ], there are some areas where we're very, very -- where it's performing very, very well. And it's performing very well, I should quickly hasten to add, not because we are super good in it, which we are, but we're also super good in the other areas that are not performing as well also. It's just the economy, the macro economy, the demand and unusual situation we're all in. 
And so we felt it is appropriate to give you guys more specifics what's driving the overall revenue and what has changed because as I also indicated in my last earnings call, when we began this year, we had a certain set of expectations, which has dramatically changed now that we finished the year. I expected -- I had expected semiconductor as an industry to recover from downturns of 2019, obviously, and that 2020 will be a slow, steady recovery, accelerating into the back end. What we didn't expect is in actual numbers, it did recover but not everything recovered. And it's -- in a sense, it's a response to the requirements, the situation of a pandemic and a work-from-home environment. And so we see those businesses that are doing superbly. 
And to really explain it, we felt we had to give you more disclosures and which we are. And if we start giving you disclosure and as I give you -- go all the way and show you where -- even how the segment -- the 2 broad segment P&L look like. And one of the other things we want to also demonstrate to you guys, loud and clear, is that we have a business model in mind, a thesis, investment thesis when we go and bind these specific software companies, some of which may not be in favor when we bought them. But what we're looking at as we look at semiconductors is that these are very sustainable franchises, which with the right approach, with the right model and the right focus, which we like to think what we described to you as the approach we're taking, that we can make them into real, sustainable franchises and generate the kind of cash and profit returns that we are demonstrating to you today and that those are sustainable."

Before I discuss our results, I do want to highlight the senior leadership appointments we just made around the same time this afternoon, which is all about ensuring continued growth and success of Broadcom. But first and foremost, as you see here, I'm not going anywhere. I'm as committed and engaged as ever. But while you often see me and Tom, behind us, we have a very strong bench that has gotten us to where we are today. So today, we are elevating some of this deep bench into critical positions that will strengthen our organization going forward. Tom, Charlie and Kirsten are among the people who sustain the platform and make the phenomenal numbers I'm about to announce happen. And to showcase our deep bench of talent at Broadcom, starting in fiscal year '21, we plan to organize a series of analyst days on the various businesses where you can hear from our respective general managers about their businesses. And to kick this off, the first will occur this January, where Ram Velaga and Alexis Björlin will review our networking franchise. 
With this, let me now turn to our very strong fourth quarter results. We capped off fiscal 2020 with record quarterly revenue and profitability despite the ongoing pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties. We delivered net revenue of $6.5 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11% sequentially and 12% -- up 12% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion, increasing 6% year-on-year and most notably representing a return to year-on-year revenue growth. Infrastructure software revenue was $1.6 billion, up 36% year-on-year, which of course, includes the contribution from Symantec. 
Let me now turn first to semiconductors. Networking, which represented approximately 35% of our semiconductor solution revenue in the quarter, was up 17% year-on-year, driven by the continued strength in cloud data center spending as well as continued spending by telcos in upgrading Edge and core networks. Moving on to Q1, we expect this trend of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth to continue even as we expect enterprise campus spending to continue to soften. 
Turning to broadband, which represented approximately 14% of semiconductor solutions in the quarter. That was up 22% year-on-year. Growth was driven by the work-from-home environment and the need among service providers as well as consumers to upgrade broadband connectivity, too, as well as within the home. We experienced strong adoption of WiFi 6 in next-generation access gateways in telcos and consumers. In fact, in this environment, WiFi, where we are very well positioned as a leader, has turned into a substantial and growing business for the company. Beyond WiFi, we also experienced strong investment by service providers in GPON, that's fiber-to-the-home, and digital subscriber line copper as well as cable modems among the cable operators. All this more than offset a decline in video. We expect low to mid-teens percentage year-on-year growth -- revenue growth in broadband for Q1 as demand continues to remain strong. 
Moving on. Wireless revenue, which represented approximately 31% of semiconductor revenue in this quarter, was up 43% sequentially in Q4 with the launch of new generation flagship phone by a large North American OEM customer. Still, this was down 9% year-on-year given the 1-quarter delay in the ramp of production of that program. Accordingly, we expect Q1 fiscal '21 to now be the peak quarter of this seasonal ramp, and revenue will compare extremely favorably with the same quarter a year ago, and we expect that to be up over 50% year-on-year. 
Turning to server storage connectivity that represented approximately 14% of Q4 semiconductor revenue -- and was down 9% year-on-year, as expected, reflecting softness in enterprise demand. Turning to Q1, we expect revenue to continue to decline. And given the strong Q1 compare in fiscal '20, we expect this to be down double digits even as much as perhaps 20%. 
Last, turning to industrial, which represented approximately 3% of Q4 semiconductor solution revenue. We're seeing demand recovery especially out of China. And consolidated resales -- and here, we sell through distributors, of course, were up 4% year-on-year. And we forecast such resales in Q1 to start -- to accelerate to mid-teens year-on-year growth as the recovery in industrial and auto continues. 
So in summary, our semiconductor solutions segment was up 6% year-on-year in Q4, driven primarily by the ramp in wireless as well as continued strength in networking and broadband. Forecasting Q1, we expect this ramp in wireless to peak, and broadband and networking demand to remain strong. This will drive revenue in the semiconductor segment to increase in Q1 by high-teens percentage year-on-year. 
Turning to software. Let me reiterate our business model here. We focus, as we have said many times, only on the largest enterprise customers and seek to increase the adoption of the software products to a hybrid model, about 90% of which are recurring subscription revenue. We have stepped up investment in R&D focused on just these core customers. And we are able to do that by spending much less on our go-to-market outside of our large core enterprise customers unlike obviously the other software companies who are chasing every last dollar of revenue no matter how much it costs. 
So let me tell you -- with 2 years of CA under our belt, let me tell you how we have done. Revenue-wise, after 2 years integrating CA onto our platform, Q4 '20 revenue was up 5% year-on-year. For Symantec, if you exclude services and hardware, Q4 product revenue of $380 million was up 10% from Q1 fiscal '20, which was obviously our first quarter after acquisition. But if we just look at revenue from our core accounts in CA, this was in fact up double digits, closer to 12% year-on-year, driven by bookings which have continued to grow double digits on an annualized basis. This is obviously -- this growth in core accounts has obviously more than offset the plain decline in services and attrition of accounts outside our core enterprise customers. That's how we expect to sustain our core software business long term albeit at low to mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth. But we intend to drive to a financial outcome that is consistent with the Broadcom model. You'll hear more on that from Kirsten when she talks about our financial model. 
So looking ahead to next quarter, on a year-on-year basis, we expect CA and Symantec software revenue to continue to grow in the mid-single digits. However, in Q1 fiscal '21, we expect Brocade to decline high single digits, consistent with softness in enterprise markets, resulting in our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat to perhaps up low single-digit percentage year-over-year. 
In summary, we expect Q1 consolidated net revenue of $6.6 billion, up approximately 13% year-over-year, all derived organically. Today, we are in a unique situation. We started fiscal 2021 with record backlog that has now grown to over $14 billion today. But the timing of this conversion of backlog to revenue won't be driven by a supply chain which continues to be tight. 
Finally, I want to take the opportunity here to thank our team for all their work in fiscal 2020. This has undoubtedly been a challenging year, and through it all, all of our employees have demonstrated unwavering focus and resilience. Because of their hard work, our mission-critical technologies have never been more relevant than they are today. 
And with that, let me turn you over to Kirsten."

By way of background, while I've been a part of Broadcom for more than 6 years, my history in accounting and reporting roles from legacy companies, Avago and LSI, dates back over 20 years. I'm proud of the strong finance organization that Broadcom has built and I look forward to working together. 
I know Hock just gave you the details on revenue, which I'll recap before moving down the P&L to discuss our fourth quarter performance, which clearly demonstrates our strong foundation for future growth. Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $6.5 billion, a 12% increase from a year ago. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $4.8 billion and represented 75% of our total revenue this quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.6 billion and represented 25% of revenue. This was up 36% year-on-year given the inclusion of Symantec. 
Continuing down the P&L. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, up approximately 370 basis points year-on-year. The expansion in gross margin year-on-year was driven by favorable product mix in semiconductors and a higher percentage of software revenue. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, up 10% year-on-year due primarily to the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $3.6 billion and represented 56% of revenue. Operating margins were up approximately 400 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 billion and represented 59% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation. 
Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68% in Q4, up 320 basis points year-over-year, driven by an improved product mix. This mix included more networking products and less wireless. As you know, wireless carries around 10 points less margin on product profitability than the rest of our semiconductor portfolio. Operating expenses were $777 million in Q4 or 16% of semiconductor solutions revenue compared to $727 million in the prior year period as we continued to invest in our business. R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 14%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 2%. Operating margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were 52% in Q4, up 290 basis points year-on-year. All told, in semiconductor solutions, revenue was up 6% and operating profit grew 12%. 
Gross margins for our infrastructure software segment were 90% in Q4, up 130 basis points year-over-year. Cost of revenue primarily includes cost of product support, hosting for our SaaS products, professional services and hardware. Operating expenses were $338 million in Q4 or 21% of infrastructure software revenue compared to $290 million or 24% of revenue in the prior year period as we generate scale through the acquisition of Symantec. R&D cost as a percentage of revenue for Q4 was approximately 12%, and SG&A as a percentage of infrastructure software revenue was 9%. Operating margin was 69% in Q4, up 480 basis points year-over-year. Our operating margins reflect our model which is about focusing on the largest enterprise customers and increasing our share of their wallet in terms of our software portfolio. Given this model, we are able to focus our R&D investments on a strategic group of customers and, by doing so, reduce costs primarily on go-to-market. This is how we get to operating margin of about 69%, which we believe we can sustain. 
Looking at cash flow. We had quarterly free cash flow of $3.2 billion, representing 50% of revenue. This is up 36% year-on-year as we managed our working capital more tightly during this pandemic. 
Moving on to capital allocation for Q4. We paid our common stockholders $1.3 billion of cash dividends. We also paid $185 million in withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 500,000 AVGO shares. We ended the quarter with 407 million outstanding common shares and 451 million diluted shares. Note that we expect the diluted share count to be 450 million in Q1. On the financing and balance sheet front, we reduced total debt by $3 billion in the quarter. All told, we ended the quarter with $7.6 billion of cash and currently have $12.6 billion of liquidity, including our $5 billion revolver. We ended the quarter with $41.1 billion of total debt, of which approximately $800 million in short term. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Our revenue hit a new record of $23.9 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $17.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $6.6 billion, which included $1.5 billion from Brocade, which was down 17% year-on-year; $3.5 billion from CA, which was up 4% year-on-year; and the addition of Symantec, which was $1.6 billion. 
Gross margin for the year was a record high of 73.5%, up from 71% a year ago. The addition of Symantec as well as a beneficial mix in semiconductor product sales drove the gross margin expansion. Additionally, operating expenses were $4.6 billion, which included the addition of Symantec. Operating income from continuing operations was $12.9 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 54% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year and represented 57% of net revenue. This figure excludes $570 million in depreciation. We accrued $644 million of restructuring and integration expenses and made $583 million of cash restructuring and integration payments in fiscal 2020. We spent $463 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow represented 49% of revenue or $11.6 billion. Free cash flow grew 25% year-over-year. 
Now on to capital allocation. For the year, we returned $6 billion to our common stockholders, consisting of $5.2 billion in the form of cash dividends and $800 million for the elimination of 2.6 million AVGO shares. We also paid $299 million in dividends to our preferred stockholders. I would also note through the refinancing and liability management activities we've undertaken this year, our weighted average debt maturity is now approximately 6 years with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5%. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, we remain committed to returning approximately 50% of our prior year normalized free cash flow to stockholders in the form of cash dividends. With that, on the dividend, based on approximately $12 billion of free cash flow in fiscal year 2020, we are increasing our target quarterly common stock cash dividend starting this quarter to $3.60 per share. This constitutes an increase of 11% and assumes a basic outstanding share count of 413 million shares at the end of fiscal 2021. We plan to maintain this dividend payout throughout this year, subject to quarterly Board approval. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we will reassess the dividend this time next year based on our fiscal '21 free cash flow results.

And the investment, we -- the cadence of the investment we're doing continues in areas that we see as very strategic in various businesses. And you've seen some of that coming out as we continue to do so. For instance, last week, we announced the introduction and ramp -- and introduction availability of the -- our 800-gig platform for switching, routing and interconnects in the basic size, retimers and all that, that goes hand in hand with it. So all about launching 800-gig platform and that comes in the form of our new product, Tomahawk 4. 
And it's pretty interesting that we're launching it now because our previous generation, which is at 400-gig platform, Tomahawk 3, which we introduced over a year ago, of course 1.5 years ago, is just starting to ramp. We then will have -- in terms -- into a larger market. And we're already launching an 800 gig. So the speed and -- the regularity and the speed at which we are pushing this product is definitely something we intend to keep. We're coming out with a newer generation. Probably -- that is probably 2x throughput capacity and the regularity of 18 months to 2 years on a consistent basis because that's what our hyper cloud customers want. And it makes sense because we need to scale up data centers as CPUs start to hit the limitation of the Moore's Law. Now that's one example. 
As part of that, as we indicated a year ago, we're stepping our investment in areas of silicon photonics basically to enable interconnects at very high throughput, at very high bandwidth. And that's been going very, very well. It's a multiyear investment. And as we indicated from the last time we talked about it, we are now only on the second year, but we expect to have something that will make -- that will be out to the marketplace within a generation or 2 of our platforms in switching and routing. And that's on that aspect of it. 
In terms of further investments, we have stepped up investment, as I indicated in my report, on WiFi, on connectivity of base 802.11ax now. And we launched that platform 2 years ago, very successful. And we're already working on -- and we have invested a lot on the next-generation WiFi 7, successor to this WiFi 6. In between, we're putting out 6-gigahertz WiFi, that's WiFi 6E, which is the spectrum bandwidth recently was approved by the FCC not long ago. And we already have our first product certified by the FCC recently. We're the first out there. So we intend to be in the lead, for instance, in this wireless connectivity, which by the way, today, as I indicated, represents a very substantial and growing part of our business. And it's a testimonial to the reliable investment and success we've gotten in this area. 
And so these are some of the things that we have. And most of this investment are multiyear, but you do start to see some of the bands, some of the products, some of the launches, some of the revenues starting to come in with this level of investments we are making in here."

Hock, the question is for you on supply constraints that several of your peers in semiconductors have mentioned, whether it's in substrates or wafers or foundry capacity. I'm curious where does Broadcom stand on this. Is supply a factor in your reported results or your Q1 outlook or something that you think can constrain the growth in fiscal '21? Just what steps are you taking to make sure it doesn't constrain growth and also, on the other side, make sure customers are not double ordering because of all these supply issues?"

We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact probably even earlier than that. We have seen -- probably even 2 quarters ago, we have seen that s",623,"Well, interesting question. We reported on -- by the way, we reported on this supply constraint at least 3 months ago when we did our earnings call, in fact probably even earlier than that. We have seen -- probably even 2 quarters ago, we have seen that supply constraint. And we were one of first to report on it. And that supply constraint continues from when we first touched on it 6 months ago. And it's -- in some area, it just seems to revolve in different specific areas, where it is. We talked about wafers then -- since then, as you correctly pointed out. And we hear in the news substrate is a consideration. And believe me, beyond that, wire-bonding is even a possible constraint depending on whether -- like it's more and more automotive legacy products come in. 
So we operate in an environment -- and I mentioned in my remarks that it's fairly unique. Here, we are in the middle of a pandemic. Here, we are where there are winners and losers even in the product lines, even in the industry we're in, where there are some businesses where demand is just booming. And we touched on that in networking, in broadband and some areas, particularly in enterprise, where they're not so strong. But what we also see is supply -- a capacity from our supply chain that is tight. That's what we're doing. And we have seen that for months, and we have taken a lot of actions to have address it and we continue to do that. We're also one of the largest consumer of those third-party manufacturers in semiconductors out there, be they wafers, be they substrates, be they back-end assembly or test capacity. We are all in there and we've been seeing it for 6 months. 
So best answer is we're managing that. We have -- having said that, we have the backlog in place. And we have also, very early on in our fiscal '20, stretched out a supply chain not only based on what we're seeing but based on what we anticipate happening. And that has also enabled us to be able to, in a more orderly manner, in what I consider a more appropriate manner, put products in the hands of end users who need it at the appropriate time. We've done that very well. And having said all that, even as we do it, our backlog continues to grow. To give you a sense, I mentioned we have $14 billion -- over $14 billion of backlog today. When we started the quarter, our backlog -- and we're shipping in between since then, beginning of the quarter, our backlog was $12 billion. So it's accelerating. 
But having said that, please don't get carried away in the other aspect. As you know, wireless business that we have is seasonal. So we are seeing -- obviously, wireless -- our wireless backlog is a significant part of a total backlog. But given the seasonality of it, we obviously have seen a deceleration in the bookings that are coming in from our wireless business. But we are seeing, on the other side, acceleration and continued strength in orders coming in from the other parts of our business. Networking has always remained strong. Broadband continues to be very strong. And now we start to see the smaller part of our business, industrial, coming in very, very strong. So one side is offsetting the other, and we continue to see this strong backlog, which in a way makes our planning in our supply chain easiest but in some ways poses other challenges of making sure we are delivering products to the right consumer -- customers at the right time."

And we do not see a slowdown in the demand. And you're correct. Operator -- service provider and operators are also adopting these merchant silicon in the routing platforms on their networks, as I mentioned, particularly in core as well as Edge. And we're seeing extreme -- very, very good demand and success, as evidenced by the backlog and orders we are getting from service providers and not just hyper cloud, particularly service providers on our merchant silicon Jericho family. So that's good. And do I see that continuing? Probably as far as you can see, '21. We have -- our lead times is now beyond 6 months to answer your question. 
So -- and just to add a further thought, we have a policy in this company that we -- and adhere to very, very strictly for both -- because of financial governance, any orders placed on us do not -- we do not allow to be canceled. All our customers know that. All our partners know that. So we're actually seeing real demand out there at least 6 months. And that brings us pretty close to the second -- to the -- or that brings us in fact to the second half of fiscal '21 at that point and, I guess as many of you will know, just in time for the beginning of a seasonal ramp of the next-generation wireless products. So our '21 visibility appears to be remarkably better than we usually have at this point in the beginning of our fiscal year."

How should we think about the seasonality into -- I guess is it the May quarter or February just especially given there seems to have been a pushout. It looks like wireless in Q4 was -- actually came in a little lower than you had expected, and it sounds like some of that's pushing into Q1. So can you -- I guess given those dynamics and given that's the seasonal peak in Q1, can you give us some idea similar to what you did last quarter on what to expect for the wireless trajectory into fiscal Q2?"

I mean we have this $14 billion of backlog, which continues to grow. And substantially, most of it -- a lot of it will be filled between Q1 and Q2, to begin with and a bigger picture.  
But in the way you ask in respect of wireless, you're correct also in pointing out when we do year-on-year comparisons now, it's very interesting because the Q4 fiscal '20, the quarter we just finished and reporting on, becomes the first quarterly ramp of our wireless business, and it compares to Q4 fiscal '19, which in typical cycles in the past is you see the peak quarter of revenue seasonally for our wireless business. So you're comparing an initial ramp against a peak quarter. And that's down, as I indicated, 9% year-on-year.  
The big ramp now for this current generation of phones in our wireless business will be our Q1, the quarter we are in now. And that compares to the Q1 of fiscal '20 now, which is post big ramp of the last generation, which is why I also indicated we're likely to see a 50 -- around a 50% year-on-year step-up in our wireless revenue. Now we go on to Q2 -- and I think people -- probably things get back to more normalcy, and as always, expect wireless to demonstrate a seasonally -- seasonality as probably the bottom quarter of an annual cycle."

I'm just kind of curious what that might mean for the software infrastructure business longer term and whether or not there's any sort of plan to potentially actually spin that business out. And I asked the question because clearly, when you look at the core IP you have in your silicon business around I/O, around acceleration and how important those IP blocks are, when you look at the sum of the part valuation of overall Broadcom, it just looks dirt cheap. You've doubled the operating margins in the software businesses since you acquired those companies and you've got great franchises in silicon and yet you're trading at a big discount. Is there a belief that perhaps the best way to get value longer term for these businesses might be a spin? And is that part of the rationale behind Tom's new position?"

But no, there's no plan. I think it's just that the software businesses, especially go-to-market, is a very interesting play for this company because Broadcom as a whole -- and you look at us, we have around $20 billion, $25 billion roughly, give or take, a few billion in revenues, each 1 year. We're a technology company, purveyors out there, technology suppliers to an ecosystem. And by that, I mean an ecosystem addresses end users, be they hyper cloud, be they service providers or be they basic, large -- while we tend to focus large enterprises out there, like the banks, insurance companies, travel agency, whatever the end user. We look at this as our eventual end-use customers. That's our ecosystem. And as key product ecosystem, we have partners with the OEMs, some distributors, but largely, our key partners are on the OEMs. And these are our partners. These are, in a way, important partners that we often sell our products with and through. We look at it that way. 
So when you look at it that way, end-use software, infrastructure software, it's no different than the silicon solutions, hardware and software tied to it that we sell out there. It's just that we tend to sell silicon software through partners, with partners who wrap in a system and go to end users versus infrastructure software where we tend to go direct though not all the time. Sometimes, we go with [ MS GS ], service providers like IBM, GTS or DXC that sells it through, but ultimately, those end users who uses our software. And we look at ecosystem that way, it makes total logical sense that we have a unified platform that does everything across. Because at the end of the day, we are still fulfilling to the same end users, whether they are semiconductor hardware solutions with software developer kit, SDK, or other operating system or straight infrastructure software, some with appliances too, I could add. And so that, to me -- to us, long term is very logical. They stay together."

And so I think with that in mind, we're comfortable with our investment-grade credit rating. We have delevered. We paid down $3 billion of debt in Q4. We're upping the dividend, as you mentioned, and sticking to the policy of giving back about 50% of free cash flow. So that's going to leave us with some excess cash. And we always look at it as what are the right relative returns and what's best for shareholders, and that usually means buying back stock or doing M&A. And I think we'll certainly look at doing both. We're biased toward acquisitions historically, and I think we'll continue to be so as long as we can find the right targets and generate the right returns consistent with our business model.

As you noticed, in addition to giving full P&L, almost full P&L to the extent there is, because there's also some amount of allocation. But we try to be very representative of our 2 large -- of our 2 segments, semiconductors and infrastructure software. 
You will notice that we've been -- especially in semiconductors, we give you a lot now more color and breakdown on what drives, what -- which are the particular end-market applications in semiconductors and the behavior and the dynamics in each of those verticals. And something we understand, we have been perhaps more lacking in the past, which we try to remedy now by giving you guys much more details. 
And it's also -- in this particular environment, it is very, very important. I think we give it because I cannot say that all cylinders are firing like crazy because as you all know, we all know, they're not in this environment. We have some cylinders -- and as we indicated very [ lastly ], there are some areas where we're very, very -- where it's performing very, very well. And it's performing very well, I should quickly hasten to add, not because we are super good in it, which we are, but we're also super good in the other areas that are not performing as well also. It's just the economy, the macro economy, the demand and unusual situation we're all in. 
And so we felt it is appropriate to give you guys more specifics what's driving the overall revenue and what has changed because as I also indicated in my last earnings call, when we began this year, we had a certain set of expectations, which has dramatically changed now that we finished the year. I expected -- I had expected semiconductor as an industry to recover from downturns of 2019, obviously, and that 2020 will be a slow, steady recovery, accelerating into the back end. What we didn't expect is in actual numbers, it did recover but not everything recovered. And it's -- in a sense, it's a response to the requirements, the situation of a pandemic and a work-from-home environment. And so we see those businesses that are doing superbly. 
And to really explain it, we felt we had to give you more disclosures and which we are. And if we start giving you disclosure and as I give you -- go all the way and show you where -- even how the segment -- the 2 broad segment P&L look like. And one of the other things we want to also demonstrate to you guys, loud and clear, is that we have a business model in mind, a thesis, investment thesis when we go and bind these specific software companies, some of which may not be in favor when we bought them. But what we're looking at as we look at semiconductors is that these are very sustainable franchises, which with the right approach, with the right model and the right focus, which we like to think what we described to you as the approach we're taking, that we can make them into real, sustainable franchises and generate the kind of cash and profit returns that we are demonstrating to you today and that those are sustainable."
