Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. On a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million,",1783,"Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. On a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million, which is 1.2% increase on a reported basis versus $616.8 million in Q4 of 2018. 
On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 2.3%. The fourth quarter revenue fell short by about $20 million from the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the cyber attack that we reported in early December. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020, about $5 million of the Q4 revenue shortfall. 
During the quarter, we experienced good demand across many of our key product areas growth in the Americas and in Europe. Sales in Asia were most impacted by the cyber attack, mainly impacting the Life Science group sales. Sales of the Life Science group in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $242 million compared to $239.6 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1% increase on a reported basis and 1.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
Much of the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR and in food safety as well as a very strong results for process media. 
Excluding process media sales, the Life Science business declined 2.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2018 as a result of the cyber attack, which impacted mainly the revenue of Life Science. 
On a geographic basis, life science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe. Our Droplet Digital PCR business continues to have good momentum. The fully integrated QX ONE system was launched in Q4, and we are very pleased with the demand outlook as we continue to ramp production and shipments. 
Sales of the clinical diagnostics products in Q4 were $379 million compared to $373 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1.6% growth on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. 
During the fourth quarter, we posted solid growth of blood typing, quality control, diabetes and immunology product lines. This growth was somewhat offset by year-over-year decline within the infectious diseases business. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia and in the Americas. The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 52.9% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.9% in Q4 2018. 
The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted mainly by lower revenue fall through, the temporary production outage and lower manufacturing utilization due to the cyber attack as well as a restructuring reserve. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.5 million compared to $4.2 million in Q4 of 2018. SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2019 were $214.2 million or 34.3% of sales. 
The SG&A expense in Q4 of 2018 was $214 million or 34.7%. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the fourth quarter was $2.1 million versus $1.8 million in Q4 of 2018. The SG&A cost savings initiatives remain a focus area to achieve our 2020 goals. 
Research and development expense in Q4 was $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales compared to $53.1 million or 8.6% in Q4 of 2018. Q4 operating income was $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $227.1 million loss in Q4 of 2018. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of the Equity Securities holdings, added $646 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $5.8 million compared to about $84,000 last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects losses and impairments on some of our venture investments. The effective tax rate in Q4 of 2019 was 20.9% and compares to 20.4% benefit in Q4 of 2018. Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $553.5 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $18.31. The increase in net income and earnings per share versus last year is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at our results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.5 million of amortization of purchase intangibles, $1.5 million of acquisition-related benefits and $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. These exclusions move the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.1% versus 55.4% in Q4 of 2018. 
The non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 31.7% versus 32.7% in Q4 of 2018. 
In SG&A on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.1 million, $1.3 million of acquisition-related benefits, a restructuring cost of $13.2 million and $2.2 million adjustment to legal reserve. In R&D, we have excluded a restructuring cost of $6.1 million. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q4 was consequently 8.2%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.5% on a GAAP basis to 14.3% on a non-GAAP basis, which is about flat from Q4 of 2018. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $646 million and $1.8 million losses associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. A change in the tax rules this quarter enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $70 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per share compared to $63.1 million and $2.09 per share in Q4 of 2018.
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year were [ $2.312 billion ] which is 3.3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The annual revenue is about $20 million below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the fourth quarter cyber attack. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020, about $5 million of the fourth quarter revenue shortfall. Sales of the Life Science group for 2019 were $885.9 million, which is an increase of 2.8% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis. 
Much of the full year-over-year growth was driven by double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR, food safety and process media. 
On a geographic basis, life science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe, driven mainly by the demand from biopharma market. 
Life science, sales in Asia were mostly impacted by the cyber attack in December. Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products for 2019 were $1.412 billion, which is about flat on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The full year-over-year growth was driven mainly by quality control, blood typing and autoimmune testing products during the year, we continue to see a nice year-over-year increase in new instruments installations. 
On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics full year-over-year sales saw growth in the Americas and in Asia as well as a modest growth in Europe. The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 55% and compared to 54.5% in 2018. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix, manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost of inventory reserves but was negatively impacted by costs associated with the cyber attack. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 34.4% compared to 35.2% in 2018. The SG&A remains a focus area for us to achieve our 2020 goals. 
Full year non-GAAP R&D was 8.5% versus 8.7% in 2018 and full year non-GAAP operating income was 12% compared to 10.7% in 2018. 
Lastly, the full year non-GAAP tax rate was 24.1% versus our guidance of 27%. The lower tax rate was mainly driven by a change in the tax rules, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $1.120 billion compared to $850 million at the end of 2018 and $985 million at the end of the third quarter. 
We reclassified $425 million of the outstanding bonds that are due in December of this year from long-term liabilities to current liabilities. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22,343 shares of our stock for $8 million at an average share price of approximately $358. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $160 million, which compares to about $105 million in Q4 of 2018. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. For the full year of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $458 million versus $285 million in 2018. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $116.8 million or 18.7% of sales. Full year adjusted EBITDA, including the Sartorius dividend that was declared in Q1 and paid in Q2 was $405.3 million or about 17.5% compared to 16.2% in 2018. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $21.6 million and full year CapEx was $98.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $34.5 million and $134.2 million for the full year. 
Moving on to the guidance for 2020. We are pleased with the overall performance in 2019, and we continue to see strong momentum in 2020. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2020 between 4.5% and 5.25%. It is too early for us to estimate at this point of time, the potential global impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We estimate a 7% to 8% currency-neutral revenue growth for the Life Science group and between 3% to 4% for the Diagnostics group in 2020. 
We continue to assume that we will experience a quarterly revenue fluctuation for process media. Q1 revenue is expected to be lower for process media compared to Q1 of 2019. However, we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 55.7% and 56.1%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin between 13.8% and 14.3%. 
We estimate the non-GAAP full year tax rate to be about 26%, And CapEx is projected between $100 million and $110 million. Overall, we are on track to achieve our goal of 20% adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of this year. And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

Thanks, Ilan. Just a few general comments. I think if you look -- for me, if you look past all the all the viruses that are floating around, I think we are pleased with the underlying progress we continue to make on the 2020 goals that we've been pursuing. That progress is, for me, a combination of good study sales growth and expense discipline. On the sales side of the equation, the markets for our products continue to grow around the world, and our outlook for 2020 is positive. I think, for me, that outlook is driven by the robust markets but also by the planned introduction of new products and platforms across the business and the full year effect of products introduced in to 2019, most notably probably the QX ONE drop of Digital PCR system introduced late in the year. 
I think the outlook also factors in the effect of 2 acquisitions we completed in 2019, one in Life Science and one in Diagnostics. 
So as you see from the results, we also continue to make progress on improving our operating income, largely driven by a focus on SG&A expenses. But we also benefited from some of the supply chain improvements that we've previously talked about. 
I guess, there's certainly more we can do to capture the benefits of the investments we've made in systems and the organization and in the markets that we're pursuing. And I do look forward to another year of progress."

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million, which is 1.2% increase on a reported basis versus $616.8 million in Q4 of 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 2.3%. The fourth quarter revenue fell short by about $20 million from the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the cyber-attack that we reported in early December. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the Q4 revenue shortfall. 
During the quarter, we experienced good demand across many of our key product areas and growth in the Americas and in Europe. Sales in Asia were most impacted by the cyber attack, mainly impacting the Life Science group sales. Sales of the Life Science group in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $242 million, compared to $239.6 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1% increase on a reported basis and 1.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR and in Food Safety as well as very strong results for Process Media. Excluding process Media Sales, the Life Science business declined 2.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2018 as a result of the cyber attack, which impacted mainly the revenue of Life Science. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe. Our Droplet Digital PCR business continues to have good momentum. The fully integrated QX ONE system was launched in Q4, and we are very pleased with the demand outlook as we continue to ramp production and shipments. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in Q4 were $379 million, compared to $373 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1.6% growth on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we posted solid growth of Blood Typing, quality control, diabetes and immunology product lines. This growth was somewhat offset by year-over-year decline within the infectious diseases business. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia and in the Americas. 
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 52.9% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.9% in Q4 2018. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted mainly by lower revenue fall-through, the temporary production outage and lower manufacturing utilization due to the cyber-attack as well as a restructuring reserve. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in Q4 of 2018. 
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2019 were $214.2 million or 34.3% of sales. The SG&A expense in Q4 of 2018 was $214 million or 34.7%. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the fourth quarter was $2.1 million versus $1.8 million in Q4 of 2018. The SG&A cost savings initiatives remain a focus area to achieve our 2020 goals. Research and development expense in Q4 was $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales, compared to $53.1 million or 8.6% in Q4 of 2018. Q4 operating income was $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales, compared to $227.1 million loss in Q4 of 2018. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of the equity securities holdings added $646 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $5.8 million, compared to about $84,000 last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects losses and impairments on some of our venture investments. The effective tax rate in Q4 of 2019 was 20.9% and compares to 20.4% benefit in Q4 of 2018. Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $553.5 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $18.31. The increase in net income and earnings per share versus last year is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at our results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $1.5 million of acquisition-related benefits and $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. These exclusions move the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.1% versus 55.4% in Q4 of 2018. The non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 31.7% versus 32.7% in Q4 of 2018. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.1 million, $1.3 million of acquisition-related benefits, a restructuring cost of $13.2 million and $2.2 million adjustment to legal reserve. In R&D, we have excluded a restructuring cost of $6.1 million. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q4 was consequently 8.2%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.5% on a GAAP basis to 14.3% on a non-GAAP basis, which is about flat from Q4 of 2018. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $646 million and $1.8 million losses associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. A change in the tax rules this quarter enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits.  
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $70 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per share, compared to $63.1 million and $2.09 per share in Q4 of 2018.
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year were $2.312 billion, which is 3.3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The annual revenue is about $20 million below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the fourth quarter cyber attack. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the fourth quarter revenue shortfall. 
Sales of the Life Science group for 2019 were $885.9 million, which is an increase of 2.8% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the full year-over-year growth was driven by double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Food Safety and Process Media. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe, driven mainly by the demand from biopharma market. Life Science sales in Asia were mostly impacted by the cyber-attack in December. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products for 2019 were $1.412 billion, which is about flat on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The full year-over-year growth was driven mainly by quality control, Blood Typing and autoimmune testing products. During the year, we continue to see a nice year-over-year increase in new instruments installations. 
On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics full year-over-year sales saw growth in the Americas and in Asia as well as a modest growth in Europe. The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 55%, compared to 54.5% in 2018. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix, manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost of inventory reserves, but was negatively impacted by costs associated with the cyber attack. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 34.4%, compared to 35.2% in 2018. The SG&A remains a focus area for us to achieve our 2020 goals. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 8.5% versus 8.7% in 2018 and full year non-GAAP operating income was 12%, compared to 10.7% in 2018. Lastly, the full year non-GAAP tax rate was 24.1% versus our guidance of 27%. The lower tax rate was mainly driven by a change in the tax rules, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $1.120 billion, compared to $850 million at the end of 2018 and $985 million at the end of the third quarter. We reclassified $425 million of the outstanding bonds that are due in December of this year from long-term liabilities to current liabilities. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22,343 shares of our stock for $8 million at an average share price of approximately $358. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $160 million, which compares to about $105 million in Q4 of 2018. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. For the full year of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $458 million versus $285 million in 2018. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $116.8 million or 18.7% of sales. Full year adjusted EBITDA, including the Sartorius dividend, that was declared in Q1 and paid in Q2, was $405.3 million or about 17.5%, compared to 16.2% in 2018. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $21.6 million and full year CapEx was $98.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $34.5 million and $134.2 million for the full year. 
Moving on to the guidance for 2020. We are pleased with the overall performance in 2019, and we continue to see strong momentum in 2020. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2020 between 4.5% and 5.25%. It is too early for us to estimate at this point of time the potential global impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We estimate 7% to 8% currency-neutral revenue growth for the Life Science group and between 3% to 4% for the Diagnostics group in 2020. We continue to assume that we will experience a quarterly revenue fluctuation for Process Media. Q1 revenue is expected to be lower for Process Media, compared to Q1 of 2019, however, we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 55.7% and 56.1%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin between 13.8% and 14.3%. 
We estimate the non-GAAP full year tax rate to be about 26%, and CapEx is projected between $100 million and $110 million. Overall, we are on track to achieve our goal of 20% adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of this year. And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

Thanks, Ilan. Just a few general comments. I think if you look -- for me, if you look past all the viruses that are floating around, I think, we are pleased with the underlying progress we continue to make on the 2020 goals that we've been pursuing. That progress is, for me, a combination of good steady sales growth and expense discipline. On the sales side of the equation, the markets for our products continue to grow around the world, and our outlook for 2020 is positive. I think, for me, that outlook is driven by the robust markets, but also by the planned introduction of new products and platforms across the business and the full year effect of products introduced in 2019, most notably probably the QX ONE Droplet Digital PCR System introduced late in the year. 
I think the outlook also factors in the effect of 2 acquisitions we completed in 2019, one in Life Science and one in Diagnostics. So as you see from the results, we also continue to make progress on improving our operating income, largely driven by a focus on SG&A expenses. But we also benefited from some of the supply chain improvements that we've previously talked about. I guess, there's certainly more we can do to capture the benefits of the investments we've made in systems and the organization and in the markets that we're pursuing. And I do look forward to another year of progress."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 on a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million, whi",1775,"Thank you, Ron. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 on a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million, which is 1.2% increase on a reported basis versus $616.8 million in Q4 of 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 2.3%. The fourth quarter revenue fell short by about $20 million from the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the cyber-attack that we reported in early December. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the Q4 revenue shortfall. 
During the quarter, we experienced good demand across many of our key product areas and growth in the Americas and in Europe. Sales in Asia were most impacted by the cyber attack, mainly impacting the Life Science group sales. Sales of the Life Science group in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $242 million, compared to $239.6 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1% increase on a reported basis and 1.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR and in Food Safety as well as very strong results for Process Media. Excluding process Media Sales, the Life Science business declined 2.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2018 as a result of the cyber attack, which impacted mainly the revenue of Life Science. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe. Our Droplet Digital PCR business continues to have good momentum. The fully integrated QX ONE system was launched in Q4, and we are very pleased with the demand outlook as we continue to ramp production and shipments. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in Q4 were $379 million, compared to $373 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1.6% growth on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we posted solid growth of Blood Typing, quality control, diabetes and immunology product lines. This growth was somewhat offset by year-over-year decline within the infectious diseases business. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia and in the Americas. 
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 52.9% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.9% in Q4 2018. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted mainly by lower revenue fall-through, the temporary production outage and lower manufacturing utilization due to the cyber-attack as well as a restructuring reserve. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in Q4 of 2018. 
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2019 were $214.2 million or 34.3% of sales. The SG&A expense in Q4 of 2018 was $214 million or 34.7%. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the fourth quarter was $2.1 million versus $1.8 million in Q4 of 2018. The SG&A cost savings initiatives remain a focus area to achieve our 2020 goals. Research and development expense in Q4 was $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales, compared to $53.1 million or 8.6% in Q4 of 2018. Q4 operating income was $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales, compared to $227.1 million loss in Q4 of 2018. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of the equity securities holdings added $646 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $5.8 million, compared to about $84,000 last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects losses and impairments on some of our venture investments. The effective tax rate in Q4 of 2019 was 20.9% and compares to 20.4% benefit in Q4 of 2018. Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $553.5 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $18.31. The increase in net income and earnings per share versus last year is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at our results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $1.5 million of acquisition-related benefits and $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. These exclusions move the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.1% versus 55.4% in Q4 of 2018. The non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 31.7% versus 32.7% in Q4 of 2018. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.1 million, $1.3 million of acquisition-related benefits, a restructuring cost of $13.2 million and $2.2 million adjustment to legal reserve. In R&D, we have excluded a restructuring cost of $6.1 million. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q4 was consequently 8.2%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.5% on a GAAP basis to 14.3% on a non-GAAP basis, which is about flat from Q4 of 2018. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $646 million and $1.8 million losses associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. A change in the tax rules this quarter enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits.  
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $70 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per share, compared to $63.1 million and $2.09 per share in Q4 of 2018.
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year were $2.312 billion, which is 3.3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The annual revenue is about $20 million below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the fourth quarter cyber attack. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the fourth quarter revenue shortfall. 
Sales of the Life Science group for 2019 were $885.9 million, which is an increase of 2.8% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the full year-over-year growth was driven by double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Food Safety and Process Media. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe, driven mainly by the demand from biopharma market. Life Science sales in Asia were mostly impacted by the cyber-attack in December. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products for 2019 were $1.412 billion, which is about flat on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The full year-over-year growth was driven mainly by quality control, Blood Typing and autoimmune testing products. During the year, we continue to see a nice year-over-year increase in new instruments installations. 
On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics full year-over-year sales saw growth in the Americas and in Asia as well as a modest growth in Europe. The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 55%, compared to 54.5% in 2018. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix, manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost of inventory reserves, but was negatively impacted by costs associated with the cyber attack. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 34.4%, compared to 35.2% in 2018. The SG&A remains a focus area for us to achieve our 2020 goals. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 8.5% versus 8.7% in 2018 and full year non-GAAP operating income was 12%, compared to 10.7% in 2018. Lastly, the full year non-GAAP tax rate was 24.1% versus our guidance of 27%. The lower tax rate was mainly driven by a change in the tax rules, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $1.120 billion, compared to $850 million at the end of 2018 and $985 million at the end of the third quarter. We reclassified $425 million of the outstanding bonds that are due in December of this year from long-term liabilities to current liabilities. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22,343 shares of our stock for $8 million at an average share price of approximately $358. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $160 million, which compares to about $105 million in Q4 of 2018. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. For the full year of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $458 million versus $285 million in 2018. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $116.8 million or 18.7% of sales. Full year adjusted EBITDA, including the Sartorius dividend, that was declared in Q1 and paid in Q2, was $405.3 million or about 17.5%, compared to 16.2% in 2018. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $21.6 million and full year CapEx was $98.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $34.5 million and $134.2 million for the full year. 
Moving on to the guidance for 2020. We are pleased with the overall performance in 2019, and we continue to see strong momentum in 2020. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2020 between 4.5% and 5.25%. It is too early for us to estimate at this point of time the potential global impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We estimate 7% to 8% currency-neutral revenue growth for the Life Science group and between 3% to 4% for the Diagnostics group in 2020. We continue to assume that we will experience a quarterly revenue fluctuation for Process Media. Q1 revenue is expected to be lower for Process Media, compared to Q1 of 2019, however, we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 55.7% and 56.1%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin between 13.8% and 14.3%. 
We estimate the non-GAAP full year tax rate to be about 26%, and CapEx is projected between $100 million and $110 million. Overall, we are on track to achieve our goal of 20% adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of this year. And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

Thanks, Ilan. Just a few general comments. I think if you look -- for me, if you look past all the viruses that are floating around, I think, we are pleased with the underlying progress we continue to make on the 2020 goals that we've been pursuing. That progress is, for me, a combination of good steady sales growth and expense discipline. On the sales side of the equation, the markets for our products continue to grow around the world, and our outlook for 2020 is positive. I think, for me, that outlook is driven by the robust markets, but also by the planned introduction of new products and platforms across the business and the full year effect of products introduced in 2019, most notably probably the QX ONE Droplet Digital PCR System introduced late in the year. 
I think the outlook also factors in the effect of 2 acquisitions we completed in 2019, one in Life Science and one in Diagnostics. So as you see from the results, we also continue to make progress on improving our operating income, largely driven by a focus on SG&A expenses. But we also benefited from some of the supply chain improvements that we've previously talked about. I guess, there's certainly more we can do to capture the benefits of the investments we've made in systems and the organization and in the markets that we're pursuing. And I do look forward to another year of progress."

Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 on a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis.

We will review the fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 on a GAAP basis as well as commentary on a non-GAAP basis. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $624.4 million, which is 1.2% increase on a reported basis versus $616.8 million in Q4 of 2018. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 2.3%. The fourth quarter revenue fell short by about $20 million from the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the cyber-attack that we reported in early December. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the Q4 revenue shortfall. 
During the quarter, we experienced good demand across many of our key product areas and growth in the Americas and in Europe. Sales in Asia were most impacted by the cyber attack, mainly impacting the Life Science group sales. Sales of the Life Science group in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $242 million, compared to $239.6 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1% increase on a reported basis and 1.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR and in Food Safety as well as very strong results for Process Media. Excluding process Media Sales, the Life Science business declined 2.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q4 of 2018 as a result of the cyber attack, which impacted mainly the revenue of Life Science. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe. Our Droplet Digital PCR business continues to have good momentum. The fully integrated QX ONE system was launched in Q4, and we are very pleased with the demand outlook as we continue to ramp production and shipments. 
Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in Q4 were $379 million, compared to $373 million in Q4 of 2018, which is 1.6% growth on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. During the fourth quarter, we posted solid growth of Blood Typing, quality control, diabetes and immunology product lines. This growth was somewhat offset by year-over-year decline within the infectious diseases business. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in Asia and in the Americas. 
The reported gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 52.9% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.9% in Q4 2018. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted mainly by lower revenue fall-through, the temporary production outage and lower manufacturing utilization due to the cyber-attack as well as a restructuring reserve. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in Q4 of 2018. 
SG&A expenses for Q4 of 2019 were $214.2 million or 34.3% of sales. The SG&A expense in Q4 of 2018 was $214 million or 34.7%. Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the fourth quarter was $2.1 million versus $1.8 million in Q4 of 2018. The SG&A cost savings initiatives remain a focus area to achieve our 2020 goals. Research and development expense in Q4 was $57.1 million or 9.1% of sales, compared to $53.1 million or 8.6% in Q4 of 2018. Q4 operating income was $59.2 million or 9.5% of sales, compared to $227.1 million loss in Q4 of 2018. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of the equity securities holdings added $646 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $5.8 million, compared to about $84,000 last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects losses and impairments on some of our venture investments. The effective tax rate in Q4 of 2019 was 20.9% and compares to 20.4% benefit in Q4 of 2018. Reported net income for the fourth quarter was $553.5 million and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $18.31. The increase in net income and earnings per share versus last year is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at our results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, $1.5 million of acquisition-related benefits and $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. These exclusions move the gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 54.1% versus 55.4% in Q4 of 2018. The non-GAAP SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 31.7% versus 32.7% in Q4 of 2018. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.1 million, $1.3 million of acquisition-related benefits, a restructuring cost of $13.2 million and $2.2 million adjustment to legal reserve. In R&D, we have excluded a restructuring cost of $6.1 million. The non-GAAP R&D expense in Q4 was consequently 8.2%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.5% on a GAAP basis to 14.3% on a non-GAAP basis, which is about flat from Q4 of 2018. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $646 million and $1.8 million losses associated with venture investments. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%. A change in the tax rules this quarter enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits.  
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $70 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per share, compared to $63.1 million and $2.09 per share in Q4 of 2018.
Moving on to the full year results. Net sales for the full year were $2.312 billion, which is 3.3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The annual revenue is about $20 million below the midpoint of our guidance, mainly due to the fourth quarter cyber attack. We expect to recover in Q1 of 2020 about $5 million of the fourth quarter revenue shortfall. 
Sales of the Life Science group for 2019 were $885.9 million, which is an increase of 2.8% on a reported basis and 4.6% on a currency-neutral basis. Much of the full year-over-year growth was driven by double-digit growth in Droplet Digital PCR, Food Safety and Process Media. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral full year-over-year sales grew in the Americas and in Europe, driven mainly by the demand from biopharma market. Life Science sales in Asia were mostly impacted by the cyber-attack in December. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products for 2019 were $1.412 billion, which is about flat on a reported basis and 2.8% growth on a currency-neutral basis. The full year-over-year growth was driven mainly by quality control, Blood Typing and autoimmune testing products. During the year, we continue to see a nice year-over-year increase in new instruments installations. 
On a geographic basis, Clinical Diagnostics full year-over-year sales saw growth in the Americas and in Asia as well as a modest growth in Europe. The full year non-GAAP gross margin was 55%, compared to 54.5% in 2018. The year-over-year margin increase was driven mainly by product mix, manufacturing efficiencies and lower cost of inventory reserves, but was negatively impacted by costs associated with the cyber attack. Full year non-GAAP SG&A was 34.4%, compared to 35.2% in 2018. The SG&A remains a focus area for us to achieve our 2020 goals. Full year non-GAAP R&D was 8.5% versus 8.7% in 2018 and full year non-GAAP operating income was 12%, compared to 10.7% in 2018. Lastly, the full year non-GAAP tax rate was 24.1% versus our guidance of 27%. The lower tax rate was mainly driven by a change in the tax rules, which enabled us to apply higher foreign tax credits. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q4 were $1.120 billion, compared to $850 million at the end of 2018 and $985 million at the end of the third quarter. We reclassified $425 million of the outstanding bonds that are due in December of this year from long-term liabilities to current liabilities. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 22,343 shares of our stock for $8 million at an average share price of approximately $358. 
For the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $160 million, which compares to about $105 million in Q4 of 2018. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. For the full year of 2019, net cash generated from operations was $458 million versus $285 million in 2018. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $116.8 million or 18.7% of sales. Full year adjusted EBITDA, including the Sartorius dividend, that was declared in Q1 and paid in Q2, was $405.3 million or about 17.5%, compared to 16.2% in 2018. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $21.6 million and full year CapEx was $98.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter was $34.5 million and $134.2 million for the full year. 
Moving on to the guidance for 2020. We are pleased with the overall performance in 2019, and we continue to see strong momentum in 2020. We are guiding a currency-neutral revenue growth in 2020 between 4.5% and 5.25%. It is too early for us to estimate at this point of time the potential global impact of the coronavirus outbreak. We estimate 7% to 8% currency-neutral revenue growth for the Life Science group and between 3% to 4% for the Diagnostics group in 2020. We continue to assume that we will experience a quarterly revenue fluctuation for Process Media. Q1 revenue is expected to be lower for Process Media, compared to Q1 of 2019, however, we estimate an overall double-digit growth for the full year. Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected between 55.7% and 56.1%, and full year non-GAAP operating margin between 13.8% and 14.3%. 
We estimate the non-GAAP full year tax rate to be about 26%, and CapEx is projected between $100 million and $110 million. Overall, we are on track to achieve our goal of 20% adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of this year. And now I'll turn the call to Norman for a few comments."

Thanks, Ilan. Just a few general comments. I think if you look -- for me, if you look past all the viruses that are floating around, I think, we are pleased with the underlying progress we continue to make on the 2020 goals that we've been pursuing. That progress is, for me, a combination of good steady sales growth and expense discipline. On the sales side of the equation, the markets for our products continue to grow around the world, and our outlook for 2020 is positive. I think, for me, that outlook is driven by the robust markets, but also by the planned introduction of new products and platforms across the business and the full year effect of products introduced in 2019, most notably probably the QX ONE Droplet Digital PCR System introduced late in the year. 
I think the outlook also factors in the effect of 2 acquisitions we completed in 2019, one in Life Science and one in Diagnostics. So as you see from the results, we also continue to make progress on improving our operating income, largely driven by a focus on SG&A expenses. But we also benefited from some of the supply chain improvements that we've previously talked about. I guess, there's certainly more we can do to capture the benefits of the investments we've made in systems and the organization and in the markets that we're pursuing. And I do look forward to another year of progress."

So I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on our current state of operations around the world. To closely monitor and keep close to all of our sites, we've established a COVID-19 oversight team to manage and respond to the pandemic situation. As we manage through this challenging period, we're focused on 3 key areas: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. 
In the area of employee safety, we have implemented work from home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and safe use of our facilities. Travel is limited only to essential customer visits for our field-based personnel. For all employees who are at work, we have implemented safety procedures in line with CDC recommendations and/or local authorities when required. In China and other Asian region countries where stay at home has been lifted, we have our teams back in the office, where we are adopting shifts, monitoring temperatures and still maintaining social distancing and cleaning routines in accordance with applicable local guidelines. 
We'll continue to follow this phased return to work approach as other regions begin lifting shelter in place restrictions. Overall we're very pleased with the positive response of our employees. Our manufacturing operations teams have responded extremely well to the situation. And to date, we've been overall able to maintain continuous production in most of our sites and have been working closely with our customers to ensure product supply continuity. As part of our response efforts, we've been able to mitigate many of the changes in customer demand, both up and down by balancing production and resources across our sites, and in a few instances, we have temporarily suspended production. In particular, we saw in the first quarter high demand for our PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products and similar to other companies have experienced some challenges in procurement and scaling production. These challenges have generally been due to our suppliers being impacted by shelter in place requirements as well as their inability to meet increased demand. With the recent launch of our SARS-CoV-2 serology test, we are also now scaling manufacturing in both the U.S. and in Europe to meet expected demand. As we look forward, we continue to monitor demand across our portfolio to optimally manage this situation, adjust capacity in our supply chain and ensure continuity of high-quality product to our customers. And lastly, while much time and energy has been recently focused on managing through the impacts of the global pandemic. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies. Thank you, and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

And now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2020 were $571.6 million, which is a 3.2% increase on a reported basis versus $554 million in Q1 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 4.3%. Sales in all regions were impacted by the global spread of COVID-19 as the quarter progressed. This was evident first in Asia, and late in the quarter, we experienced a tapering in demand in the U.S. and in Europe. As you recall, we estimated $5 million revenue carryover from Q4 due to the cyber attack. We now feel that the first quarter probably benefited by closer to $10 million. As Andy alluded to, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. 
We saw strong orders for PCR-based products related to COVID-19 testing and research and lower demand, mainly within the clinical diagnostics portfolio, which was impacted by shelter in place guidelines. 
Sales of the Life Science group in the first quarter of 2020 were $227.2 million compared to $215.7 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 5.3% increase on a reported basis and a 6% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Matching year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by double-digit growth in gene expression, Droplet Digital PCR, antibody products and Food Safety. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand related to COVID-19 testing and related research. Growth in the Life Science segment was somewhat offset by softer academic research demand as well as the tough compare to 2019 related to our process media product line. 
Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2019. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe as well as a nice growth in the Americas when excluding Process Media. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the first quarter were $340.3 million compared to $334.1 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 1.9% growth on a reported basis and a 3.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis. 
During the first quarter, we posted solid growth in Blood Typing and quality controls. This growth was somewhat offset by a year-over-year decline within our diabetes and immunology product lines, which showed the earliest signs of reduced demand due to lower noncritical hospitals and clinic visits. Overall, a decrease in routine testing and elective surgeries impacted the Diagnostics group revenue. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in the Americas and in Europe. As you may have seen in our recent press releases, we are the first company to receive FDA emergency use authorization for a total antibody serology test for COVID-19, a test which has also met CE mark requirements for Europe. Clinical evaluation of this test has demonstrated diagnostics specificity of more than 99%. And diagnostics sensitivity of 98%, 8 days after the onset of symptoms. 
We also received FDA emergency use authorization for our Droplet Digital PCR COVID-19 test kit. The test can detect the virus with high sensitivity even when a low viral load is present. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 55.5% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.3% in Q1 of 2019. In 2019, gross margin benefited from an escrow release of $7.4 million related to an acquisition from 2011. Net of this, the current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and lower inventory reserve expense. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $3.9 million compared to $3.7 million in Q1 of 2019. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2020 were $193.7 million or 33.9% of sales compared to $207.6 million or 37.5% in Q1 of 2019. Reduction in the SG&A expenses were the result of ongoing cost savings initiatives as well as disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, driven by travel and marketing expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2 million versus $1.7 million in Q1 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q1 was $49.3 million or 8.6% of sales compared to $47.6 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2019. The Q1 operating income was $74.4 million or 13% of sales compared to 56.6%, $8 million, sorry, or 10.2% in Q1 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $827.7 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $3.3 million compared to $11.4 million of income last year. 
Q1 of 2019 included $15.7 million of dividend from Sartorius, which was not declared in Q1 of 2020. The effective tax rate was 23.7% compared to 23.2% in Q1 of 2019. The reported net income for the first quarter was $685.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $22.72. This is a decrease from last year and is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the first quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $3.9 million of amortization of purchase intangibles and $1.5 million of restructuring benefits. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2020, to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.9% versus 55.6% and in Q1 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2020 was 33.3% versus 36.4% in Q1 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2 million, legal-related expenses of $1.8 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of $600,000. 
In R&D, we have excluded $400,000 of restructuring benefit and the non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 8.7%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13% on a GAAP basis to 13.9% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2019 of 10.5%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $827.7 million and $1.3 million of loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% versus 28.5% in Q1 of 2019. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $57.6 million or $1.91 diluted earnings per share compared to $49.6 million and $1.65 per share in Q1 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.42 billion compared to $1.12 billion at the end of 2019. 
During the first quarter, we purchased 291,941 shares of our stock for a total of $100 million at an average price of approximately $342 per share. 
For the first quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operations was $63 million, which compares to about $43 million in Q1 of 2019. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Celsee for $100 million in cash. Celsee is an exciting early stage company with products focused on detection and analysis of single cells. We plan to further invest in new applications to enhance Celsee's technology. 
We also completed in early April, a divestiture of a small noncore business that used to be part of our former analytical instruments group. The proceeds from that transaction were about $12 million. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019 was $101.7 million or 18.4% of sales, which included the 19 -- which included the 19 -- the 2019, sorry, Sartorius dividend. 
The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019, excluding the Sartorius dividend was about 15.5%. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2020 were $21.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $33.6 million. Moving on to the guidance. Given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are withdrawing our previously issued annual guidance for this year. We currently believe that the second quarter year-over-year sales may decline by 10% to 15%. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return toward protocols. We believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect some recovery in the second half of the year.

This is Dara. So starting with your first question around positioning. I mean, as you said, there are other players with a variety of throughput capabilities who are entering the market, we believe that a key differentiator for our platform is that is an open system, and incredibly well suited for medium-sized labs or as a complementary format to high throughput systems, which are typically closed systems. And so as routine testing starts to ramp-up in those large laboratories, we also expect that there will be kind of competition for volume on those closed systems. And so we believe that our platform offers a really, really nice approach to either do batch processing alongside those systems and/or we think the workflow is really great for medium-sized labs. The kit can be run on our [indiscernible] platform, which is our automated plate reader that you referred to, of which there are more than 3,000 installed globally or it can be adapted to any plate based system, of which there are tens of thousands of systems globally to automate both the kind of pipe heading and plate handling. So great flexibility there. 
From a capacity perspective, this is an exceptionally scalable format for manufacturing approach as well. So we've got the capability to manufacture few millions of tests a week if the demand is there. And as you've probably read, the adoption of serology's routine practice is still being established, but we believe that the opportunity is meaningful. And then lastly, you asked about ASPs. So the pricing for CPT codes in North America are still being established. But we think that ASP will depend on volume as well as other market entrants, but likely to be in the mid single-digit range. Was that all your questions, Brandon?"

To closely monitor and keep close to all of our sites, we've established a COVID-19 oversight team to manage and respond to the pandemic situation. As we manage through this challenging period, we're focused on 3 key areas: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
In the area of employee safety, we have implemented work from home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and safe use of our facilities. Travel is limited only to essential customer visits for our field-based personnel. For all employees who are at work, we have implemented safety procedures in line with CDC recommendations and/or local authorities when required. In China and other Asian region countries where stay at home has been lifted, we have our teams back in the office, where we are adopting shifts, monitoring temperatures and still maintaining social distancing and cleaning routines in accordance with applicable local guidelines.

And to date, we've been overall able to maintain continuous production in most of our sites and have been working closely with our customers to ensure product supply continuity. As part of our response efforts, we've been able to mitigate many of the changes in customer demand, both up and down by balancing production and resources across our sites, and in a few instances, we have temporarily suspended production. In particular, we saw in the first quarter high demand for our PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products, and similar to other companies, have experienced some challenges in procurement and scaling production. These challenges have generally been due to our suppliers being impacted by shelter-in-place requirements as well as their inability to meet increased demand. 
With the recent launch of our SARS-CoV-2 Serology test, we are also now scaling manufacturing in both the U.S. and in Europe to meet expected demand. As we look forward, we continue to monitor demand across our portfolio to optimally manage this situation, adjust capacity in our supply chain and ensure continuity of high-quality product to our customers. 
And lastly, while much time and energy has been recently focused on managing through the impacts of the global pandemic, we continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies. Thank you, and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

And now I would like to review the results of the first quarter.

And now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2020 were $571.6 million, which is a 3.2% increase on a reported basis versus $554 million in Q1 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 4.3%. Sales in all regions were impacted by the global spread of COVID-19 as the quarter progressed. This was evident first in Asia, and late in the quarter, we experienced a tapering in demand in the U.S. and in Europe. As you recall, we estimated $5 million revenue carryover from Q4 due to the cyber attack. We now feel that the first quarter probably benefited by closer to $10 million. As Andy alluded to, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio.
We saw strong orders for PCR-based products related to COVID-19 testing and research and lower demand, mainly within the clinical diagnostics portfolio, which was impacted by shelter-in-place guidelines.
Sales of the Life Science group in the first quarter of 2020 were $227.2 million compared to $215.7 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 5.3% increase on a reported basis and a 6% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Matching year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by double-digit growth in gene expression, Droplet Digital PCR, antibody products and Food Safety. 
Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand related to COVID-19 testing and related research. Growth in the Life Science segment was somewhat offset by softer academic research demand as well as the tough compare to 2019 related to our process media product line.
Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2019. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe as well as a nice growth in the Americas when excluding Process Media.
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the first quarter were $340.3 million compared to $334.1 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 1.9% growth on a reported basis and a 3.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis.
During the first quarter, we posted solid growth in Blood Typing and quality controls. This growth was somewhat offset by a year-over-year decline within our diabetes and immunology product lines, which showed the earliest signs of reduced demand due to lower noncritical hospitals and clinic visits. Overall a decrease in routine lab testing and elective surgeries impacted the Diagnostics group revenue. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in the Americas and in Europe. As you may have seen in our recent press releases, we are the first company to receive FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a total antibody Serology test for COVID-19, a test which has also met CE mark requirements for Europe. Clinical evaluation of this test has demonstrated diagnostics specificity of more than 99%. And diagnostics sensitivity of 98%, 8 days after the onset of symptoms.
We also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our Droplet Digital PCR COVID-19 test kit. The test can detect the virus with high sensitivity, even when a low viral load is present. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 55.5% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.3% in Q1 of 2019. In 2019, gross margin benefited from an escrow release of $7.4 million related to an acquisition from 2011. Net of this, the current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and lower inventory reserves expense. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $3.9 million compared to $3.7 million in Q1 of 2019. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2020 were $193.7 million or 33.9% of sales compared to $207.6 million or 37.5% in Q1 of 2019. Reduction in the SG&A expenses were the result of ongoing cost savings initiatives as well as disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, driven by travel and marketing expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2 million versus $1.7 million in Q1 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q1 was $49.3 million, or 8.6% of sales compared to $47.6 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2019. Q1 operating income was $74.4 million or 13% of sales compared $56.6 million, or 10.2% in Q1 of 2019.
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $827.7 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $3.3 million compared to $11.4 million of income last year.
Q1 of 2019 included $15.7 million of dividend from Sartorius, which was not declared in Q1 of 2020. The effective tax rate was 23.7% compared to 23.2% in Q1 of 2019. Reported net income for the first quarter was $685.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $22.72. This is a decrease from last year and is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the first quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $3.9 million of amortization of purchase intangibles and $1.5 million of restructuring benefits. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.9% versus 55.6% in Q1 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2020 was 33.3% versus 36.4% in Q1 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2 million, legal-related expenses of $1.8 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefit of $600,000.
In R&D, we had excluded $400,000 of restructuring benefit and the non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 8.7%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13% on a GAAP basis to 13.9% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2019 of 10.5%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $827.7 million and $1.3 million of loss associated with venture investments.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% versus 28.5% in Q1 of 2019. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $57.6 million or $1.91 diluted earnings per share compared to $49.6 million and $1.65 per share in Q1 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.42 billion compared to $1.120 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we purchased 291,941 shares of our stock for a total of $100 million at an average price of approximately $342 per share.
For the first quarter of 2020 net cash generated from operations was $63 million, which compares to about $43 million in Q1 of 2019. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. 
Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Celsee for $100 million in cash. Celsee is an exciting early stage company with products focused on detection and analysis of single cells. We plan to further invest in new applications to enhance Celsee's technology.
We also completed in early April, a divestiture of a small noncore business that used to be part of our former analytical instruments group. The proceeds from that transaction were about $12 million.
The adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019 was $101.7 million or 18.4% of sales, which included the '19 -- which included the '19 -- the 2019, sorry, Sartorius dividend.
The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019, excluding the Sartorius dividend was about 15.5%. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2020 were $21.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $33.6 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. Given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are withdrawing our previously issued annual guidance for this year. We currently believe that the second quarter year-over-year sales may decline by 10% to 15%. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return-to-work protocols. We believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect some recovery in the second half of the year. But currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience.

This is Dara. So starting with your first question around positioning. I mean as you said, there are other players with a variety of throughput capabilities who are entering the market, we believe that a key differentiator for our platform is that it is an open system and incredibly well suited for medium-sized labs or as a complementary format to high throughput systems, which are typically closed systems. And so as routine testing starts to ramp-up in those large laboratories, we also expect that there will be kind of competition for volume on those closed systems. And so we believe that our platform offers a really, really nice approach to either do batch processing alongside those systems and/or we think the workflow is really great for medium-sized labs. The kit can be run on our EVOLIS platform, which is our automated plate reader that you referred to, of which there are more than 3,000 installed globally, or it can be adapted to any plate-based system, of which there are tens of thousands of systems globally to automate both the kind of pipe heading and plate handling. So great flexibility there.
From a capacity perspective, this is an exceptionally scalable format for manufacturing approach as well. So we've got the capability to manufacture few millions of tests a week if the demand is there. And as you've probably read, the adoption of Serology's routine practice is still being established, but we believe that the opportunity is meaningful. And then lastly, you asked about ASPs. So the pricing for CPT codes in North America are still being established. But we think that ASP will depend on volume as well as other market entrants, but likely to be in the mid single-digit range. Was that all your questions, Brandon?"

So I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on our current state of operations around the world. To closely monitor and keep close to all of our sites, we've established a COVID-19 oversight team to manage and respond to the pandemic situation. As we manage through this challenging period, we're focused on 3 key areas: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
In the area of employee safety, we have implemented work from home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and safe use of our facilities. Travel is limited only to essential customer visits for our field-based personnel. For all employees who are at work, we have implemented safety procedures in line with CDC recommendations and/or local authorities when required. In China and other Asian region countries where stay at home has been lifted, we have our teams back in the office, where we are adopting shifts, monitoring temperatures and still maintaining social distancing and cleaning routines in accordance with applicable local guidelines.
We'll continue to follow this phased return-to-work approach as other regions begin lifting shelter-in-place restrictions. Overall we're very pleased with the positive response of our employees. Our manufacturing operations teams have responded extremely well to this situation. And to date, we've been overall able to maintain continuous production in most of our sites and have been working closely with our customers to ensure product supply continuity. As part of our response efforts, we've been able to mitigate many of the changes in customer demand, both up and down by balancing production and resources across our sites, and in a few instances, we have temporarily suspended production. In particular, we saw in the first quarter high demand for our PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products, and similar to other companies, have experienced some challenges in procurement and scaling production. These challenges have generally been due to our suppliers being impacted by shelter-in-place requirements as well as their inability to meet increased demand. 
With the recent launch of our SARS-CoV-2 Serology test, we are also now scaling manufacturing in both the U.S. and in Europe to meet expected demand. As we look forward, we continue to monitor demand across our portfolio to optimally manage this situation, adjust capacity in our supply chain and ensure continuity of high-quality product to our customers. 
And lastly, while much time and energy has been recently focused on managing through the impacts of the global pandemic, we continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies. Thank you, and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

And now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2020 were $571.6 million, which is a 3.2% increase on a reported basis versus $554 million in Q1 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 4.3%. Sales in all regions were impacted by the global spread of COVID-19 as the quarter progressed. This was evident first in Asia, and late in the quarter, we experienced a tapering in demand in the U.S. and in Europe. As you recall, we estimated $5 million revenue carryover from Q4 due to the cyber attack. We now feel that the first quarter probably benefited by closer to $10 million. As Andy alluded to, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio.
We saw strong orders for PCR-based products related to COVID-19 testing and research and lower demand, mainly within the clinical diagnostics portfolio, which was impacted by shelter-in-place guidelines.
Sales of the Life Science group in the first quarter of 2020 were $227.2 million compared to $215.7 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 5.3% increase on a reported basis and a 6% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Matching year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by double-digit growth in gene expression, Droplet Digital PCR, antibody products and Food Safety. 
Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand related to COVID-19 testing and related research. Growth in the Life Science segment was somewhat offset by softer academic research demand as well as the tough compare to 2019 related to our process media product line.
Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2019. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe as well as a nice growth in the Americas when excluding Process Media.
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the first quarter were $340.3 million compared to $334.1 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 1.9% growth on a reported basis and a 3.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis.
During the first quarter, we posted solid growth in Blood Typing and quality controls. This growth was somewhat offset by a year-over-year decline within our diabetes and immunology product lines, which showed the earliest signs of reduced demand due to lower noncritical hospitals and clinic visits. Overall a decrease in routine lab testing and elective surgeries impacted the Diagnostics group revenue. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in the Americas and in Europe. As you may have seen in our recent press releases, we are the first company to receive FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a total antibody Serology test for COVID-19, a test which has also met CE mark requirements for Europe. Clinical evaluation of this test has demonstrated diagnostics specificity of more than 99%. And diagnostics sensitivity of 98%, 8 days after the onset of symptoms.
We also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our Droplet Digital PCR COVID-19 test kit. The test can detect the virus with high sensitivity, even when a low viral load is present. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 55.5% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.3% in Q1 of 2019. In 2019, gross margin benefited from an escrow release of $7.4 million related to an acquisition from 2011. Net of this, the current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and lower inventory reserves expense. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $3.9 million compared to $3.7 million in Q1 of 2019. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2020 were $193.7 million or 33.9% of sales compared to $207.6 million or 37.5% in Q1 of 2019. Reduction in the SG&A expenses were the result of ongoing cost savings initiatives as well as disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, driven by travel and marketing expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2 million versus $1.7 million in Q1 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q1 was $49.3 million, or 8.6% of sales compared to $47.6 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2019. Q1 operating income was $74.4 million or 13% of sales compared $56.6 million, or 10.2% in Q1 of 2019.
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $827.7 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $3.3 million compared to $11.4 million of income last year.
Q1 of 2019 included $15.7 million of dividend from Sartorius, which was not declared in Q1 of 2020. The effective tax rate was 23.7% compared to 23.2% in Q1 of 2019. Reported net income for the first quarter was $685.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $22.72. This is a decrease from last year and is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the first quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $3.9 million of amortization of purchase intangibles and $1.5 million of restructuring benefits. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.9% versus 55.6% in Q1 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2020 was 33.3% versus 36.4% in Q1 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2 million, legal-related expenses of $1.8 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefit of $600,000.
In R&D, we had excluded $400,000 of restructuring benefit and the non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 8.7%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13% on a GAAP basis to 13.9% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2019 of 10.5%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $827.7 million and $1.3 million of loss associated with venture investments.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% versus 28.5% in Q1 of 2019. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $57.6 million or $1.91 diluted earnings per share compared to $49.6 million and $1.65 per share in Q1 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.42 billion compared to $1.120 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we purchased 291,941 shares of our stock for a total of $100 million at an average price of approximately $342 per share.
For the first quarter of 2020 net cash generated from operations was $63 million, which compares to about $43 million in Q1 of 2019. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. 
Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Celsee for $100 million in cash. Celsee is an exciting early stage company with products focused on detection and analysis of single cells. We plan to further invest in new applications to enhance Celsee's technology.
We also completed in early April, a divestiture of a small noncore business that used to be part of our former analytical instruments group. The proceeds from that transaction were about $12 million.
The adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019 was $101.7 million or 18.4% of sales, which included the '19 -- which included the '19 -- the 2019, sorry, Sartorius dividend.
The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019, excluding the Sartorius dividend was about 15.5%. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2020 were $21.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $33.6 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. Given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are withdrawing our previously issued annual guidance for this year. We currently believe that the second quarter year-over-year sales may decline by 10% to 15%. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return-to-work protocols. We believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect some recovery in the second half of the year. But currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience.

This is Dara. So starting with your first question around positioning. I mean as you said, there are other players with a variety of throughput capabilities who are entering the market, we believe that a key differentiator for our platform is that it is an open system and incredibly well suited for medium-sized labs or as a complementary format to high throughput systems, which are typically closed systems. And so as routine testing starts to ramp-up in those large laboratories, we also expect that there will be kind of competition for volume on those closed systems. And so we believe that our platform offers a really, really nice approach to either do batch processing alongside those systems and/or we think the workflow is really great for medium-sized labs. The kit can be run on our EVOLIS platform, which is our automated plate reader that you referred to, of which there are more than 3,000 installed globally, or it can be adapted to any plate-based system, of which there are tens of thousands of systems globally to automate both the kind of pipe heading and plate handling. So great flexibility there.
From a capacity perspective, this is an exceptionally scalable format for manufacturing approach as well. So we've got the capability to manufacture few millions of tests a week if the demand is there. And as you've probably read, the adoption of Serology's routine practice is still being established, but we believe that the opportunity is meaningful. And then lastly, you asked about ASPs. So the pricing for CPT codes in North America are still being established. But we think that ASP will depend on volume as well as other market entrants, but likely to be in the mid single-digit range. Was that all your questions, Brandon?"

So far, we baked in different scenarios, and that's how we came up with the range for Q2. And we'll have to wait and see how Q2 will -- this is going to evolve."

So I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on our current state of operations around the world. To closely monitor and keep close to all of our sites, we've established a COVID-19 oversight team to manage and respond to the pandemic situation. As we manage through this challenging period, we're focused on 3 key areas: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
In the area of employee safety, we have implemented work from home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and safe use of our facilities. Travel is limited only to essential customer visits for our field-based personnel. For all employees who are at work, we have implemented safety procedures in line with CDC recommendations and/or local authorities when required. In China and other Asian region countries where stay at home has been lifted, we have our teams back in the office, where we are adopting shifts, monitoring temperatures and still maintaining social distancing and cleaning routines in accordance with applicable local guidelines.
We'll continue to follow this phased return-to-work approach as other regions begin lifting shelter-in-place restrictions. Overall we're very pleased with the positive response of our employees. Our manufacturing operations teams have responded extremely well to this situation. And to date, we've been overall able to maintain continuous production in most of our sites and have been working closely with our customers to ensure product supply continuity. As part of our response efforts, we've been able to mitigate many of the changes in customer demand, both up and down by balancing production and resources across our sites, and in a few instances, we have temporarily suspended production. In particular, we saw in the first quarter high demand for our PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products, and similar to other companies, have experienced some challenges in procurement and scaling production. These challenges have generally been due to our suppliers being impacted by shelter-in-place requirements as well as their inability to meet increased demand. 
With the recent launch of our SARS-CoV-2 Serology test, we are also now scaling manufacturing in both the U.S. and in Europe to meet expected demand. As we look forward, we continue to monitor demand across our portfolio to optimally manage this situation, adjust capacity in our supply chain and ensure continuity of high-quality product to our customers. 
And lastly, while much time and energy has been recently focused on managing through the impacts of the global pandemic, we continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies. Thank you, and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

And now I would like to review the results of the first quarter. Net sales for the first quarter of 2020 were $571.6 million, which is a 3.2% increase on a reported basis versus $554 million in Q1 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 4.3%. Sales in all regions were impacted by the global spread of COVID-19 as the quarter progressed. This was evident first in Asia, and late in the quarter, we experienced a tapering in demand in the U.S. and in Europe. As you recall, we estimated $5 million revenue carryover from Q4 due to the cyber attack. We now feel that the first quarter probably benefited by closer to $10 million. As Andy alluded to, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio.
We saw strong orders for PCR-based products related to COVID-19 testing and research and lower demand, mainly within the clinical diagnostics portfolio, which was impacted by shelter-in-place guidelines.
Sales of the Life Science group in the first quarter of 2020 were $227.2 million compared to $215.7 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 5.3% increase on a reported basis and a 6% increase on a currency-neutral basis. Matching year-over-year growth in the first quarter was driven by double-digit growth in gene expression, Droplet Digital PCR, antibody products and Food Safety. 
Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand related to COVID-19 testing and related research. Growth in the Life Science segment was somewhat offset by softer academic research demand as well as the tough compare to 2019 related to our process media product line.
Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 11.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q1 of 2019. On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe as well as a nice growth in the Americas when excluding Process Media.
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the first quarter were $340.3 million compared to $334.1 million in Q1 of 2019, which is a 1.9% growth on a reported basis and a 3.2% growth on a currency-neutral basis.
During the first quarter, we posted solid growth in Blood Typing and quality controls. This growth was somewhat offset by a year-over-year decline within our diabetes and immunology product lines, which showed the earliest signs of reduced demand due to lower noncritical hospitals and clinic visits. Overall a decrease in routine lab testing and elective surgeries impacted the Diagnostics group revenue. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted growth in the Americas and in Europe. As you may have seen in our recent press releases, we are the first company to receive FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a total antibody Serology test for COVID-19, a test which has also met CE mark requirements for Europe. Clinical evaluation of this test has demonstrated diagnostics specificity of more than 99%. And diagnostics sensitivity of 98%, 8 days after the onset of symptoms.
We also received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our Droplet Digital PCR COVID-19 test kit. The test can detect the virus with high sensitivity, even when a low viral load is present. The reported gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 55.5% on a GAAP basis and compares to 56.3% in Q1 of 2019. In 2019, gross margin benefited from an escrow release of $7.4 million related to an acquisition from 2011. Net of this, the current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and lower inventory reserves expense. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $3.9 million compared to $3.7 million in Q1 of 2019. SG&A expenses for Q1 of 2020 were $193.7 million or 33.9% of sales compared to $207.6 million or 37.5% in Q1 of 2019. Reduction in the SG&A expenses were the result of ongoing cost savings initiatives as well as disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, driven by travel and marketing expenses due to the impact of COVID-19.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2 million versus $1.7 million in Q1 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q1 was $49.3 million, or 8.6% of sales compared to $47.6 million or 8.6% in Q1 of 2019. Q1 operating income was $74.4 million or 13% of sales compared $56.6 million, or 10.2% in Q1 of 2019.
Looking below the operating line. The change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $827.7 million of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other expense of $3.3 million compared to $11.4 million of income last year.
Q1 of 2019 included $15.7 million of dividend from Sartorius, which was not declared in Q1 of 2020. The effective tax rate was 23.7% compared to 23.2% in Q1 of 2019. Reported net income for the first quarter was $685.9 million and diluted earnings per share were $22.72. This is a decrease from last year and is substantially related to the valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the first quarter, in cost of goods sold, we have excluded $3.9 million of amortization of purchase intangibles and $1.5 million of restructuring benefits. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.9% versus 55.6% in Q1 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the first quarter of 2020 was 33.3% versus 36.4% in Q1 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2 million, legal-related expenses of $1.8 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefit of $600,000.
In R&D, we had excluded $400,000 of restructuring benefit and the non-GAAP R&D expense in Q1 was consequently 8.7%. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 13% on a GAAP basis to 13.9% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 of 2019 of 10.5%. We have also excluded certain items below the operating line which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $827.7 million and $1.3 million of loss associated with venture investments.
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% versus 28.5% in Q1 of 2019. The tax rate was impacted by changes in the geographic mix of earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $57.6 million or $1.91 diluted earnings per share compared to $49.6 million and $1.65 per share in Q1 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. The cash and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were $1.42 billion compared to $1.120 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we purchased 291,941 shares of our stock for a total of $100 million at an average price of approximately $342 per share.
For the first quarter of 2020 net cash generated from operations was $63 million, which compares to about $43 million in Q1 of 2019. This improvement mainly reflects the higher operating profits and improved working capital. 
Following the end of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Celsee for $100 million in cash. Celsee is an exciting early stage company with products focused on detection and analysis of single cells. We plan to further invest in new applications to enhance Celsee's technology.
We also completed in early April, a divestiture of a small noncore business that used to be part of our former analytical instruments group. The proceeds from that transaction were about $12 million.
The adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was $107.4 million or 18.8% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019 was $101.7 million or 18.4% of sales, which included the '19 -- which included the '19 -- the 2019, sorry, Sartorius dividend.
The adjusted EBITDA in Q1 of 2019, excluding the Sartorius dividend was about 15.5%. Net capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2020 were $21.6 million, and depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $33.6 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. Given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are withdrawing our previously issued annual guidance for this year. We currently believe that the second quarter year-over-year sales may decline by 10% to 15%. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return-to-work protocols. We believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect some recovery in the second half of the year. But currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience.

This is Dara. So starting with your first question around positioning. I mean as you said, there are other players with a variety of throughput capabilities who are entering the market, we believe that a key differentiator for our platform is that it is an open system and incredibly well suited for medium-sized labs or as a complementary format to high throughput systems, which are typically closed systems. And so as routine testing starts to ramp-up in those large laboratories, we also expect that there will be kind of competition for volume on those closed systems. And so we believe that our platform offers a really, really nice approach to either do batch processing alongside those systems and/or we think the workflow is really great for medium-sized labs. The kit can be run on our EVOLIS platform, which is our automated plate reader that you referred to, of which there are more than 3,000 installed globally, or it can be adapted to any plate-based system, of which there are tens of thousands of systems globally to automate both the kind of pipe heading and plate handling. So great flexibility there.
From a capacity perspective, this is an exceptionally scalable format for manufacturing approach as well. So we've got the capability to manufacture few millions of tests a week if the demand is there. And as you've probably read, the adoption of Serology's routine practice is still being established, but we believe that the opportunity is meaningful. And then lastly, you asked about ASPs. So the pricing for CPT codes in North America are still being established. But we think that ASP will depend on volume as well as other market entrants, but likely to be in the mid single-digit range. Was that all your questions, Brandon?"

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations, and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. 
We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19 related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. 
The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release. I'll now turn over the call to Ilan Daskal, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."

And I'd like to start by taking a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize our employees around the world who continue to make extraordinary efforts to serve our customers under the current circumstances. So thank you to all of our employees for your dedication and continued commitment to the company. Your efforts are truly appreciated. So since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been focused on 3 key areas to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies. 
On employee safety, we have worked hard to put measures in place to guard the well-being and safety of our employees. Early on, we implemented work from home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production in core R&D. And we continue to have this policy in place in the U.S. In Asia, return back to the workplace resumed relatively faster than the rest of our regions, and we are now starting to see resumption in Europe as well. We have requirements in place for social distancing, wearing of masks, temperature checks, contact tracing and, of course, remote working from home depending on the region. All of these measures have served to minimize the number of cases we have experienced throughout Bio-Rad. 
Our manufacturing operations team have also responded extremely well. Early on in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruptions as we ramped up production to meet the increased demand of mainly our PCR instruments, but reagents, too. Today, we are in a more appropriately scaled position to meet demand, and we have room to continue expanding production should the need arise. 
Lastly, with much time and energy were spent initially to manage through the impacts of the global pandemic, we have adjusted extremely well to the new working environments and believe that we have executed well given the situation. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies and look forward to sharing more details later this year. So with that overview, I'd like to pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis,",1621,"Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales decreased 4.4%. On a regional basis, strength in Asia was offset by weakness in other regions. As Andy alluded, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. We estimate that the COVID-19 related sales were about $71 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2020 were $252.1 million compared to $212.4 million in Q2 of 2019, which is an 18.7% increase on a reported basis and a 20% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The majority of the year-over-year growth in the second quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR product revenue increases were driven by strong demand for COVID-19 related products. Growth in the -- overall in the Life Science segment was offset by softer academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating materially below capacity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw significant year-over-year growth in the quarter, which was primarily due to an easy compare over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2019. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe, while the Americas were about flat. We continue to be excited about our Droplet Digital PCR platforms. The unique sensitivity and specificity of the technology continues to open up new opportunities and applications. 
During the current pandemic, it is being deployed to monitor SARS Cove 2 prevalence in wastewater streams. Sales of the clinical diagnostics products in the second quarter were $283.2 million compared to $357.1 million in Q2 of 2019, which is a 20.7% decline on a reported basis and an 18.7% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, Clinical Diagnostics segment experienced weakness across all of its product lines due to the reduced demand from lower noncritical hospital and clinic visits. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics group posted declines across all regions. We continue to execute on our new product development strategy. We launched in the second quarter, the [ gel-doc-go  ]imaging system, which provides a benchtop imaging solution in a compact and automated package. 
We also launched a new label claim for our [ Genius HIV one, HIV 2 ] supplemental say, which is now approved by the FDA for using blood and plasma donation center settings. The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 54.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.7% in Q2 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and higher utilization, partially offset by an $8 million customs duty charge taken in the quarter relating to products shipped primarily in prior years. This $8 million expense impacted the gross margin by about 150 basis points. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $5 million compared to $3.8 million in Q2 of 2019. SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2020 were $189.3 million or 35.3% of sales compared to $201.3 million or 35.1% in Q2 of 2019. Reduction in SG&A expenses was the result of disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, primarily travel and marketing expenses due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. The year-over-year decrease on a dollar basis was $12 million, and we expect that most of the discretionary cost savings will gradually come back over the coming quarters as we return back to the workplace. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.6 million in Q2 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q2 was $52 million or 9.7% of sales compared to $50.1 million or 8.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Q2 operating income was $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $56.4 million or 9.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings, added $1.183 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $10.7 million compared to $3.2 million of expense last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July. 
In 2019, the dividend was declared in March and was paid in April. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.2% in Q2 of 2019. Reported net income for the second quarter was $966.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $32.15. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and the negligible restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.5% versus 54.4% in Q2 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 was 33.9% versus 34.5% in Q2 of 2019. In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization and purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $2.6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $2.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.8% and versus 8.8% in Q2 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded about $700,000 restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.6% on a GRP basis to 11.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2019 of 11.1%. We have excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.183 billion, a $1.1 million of loss associated with venture investments and an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a small noncore business that was part of our other operations segment. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% and compared to 26.5% in Q2 of 2019. The decrease in rate was driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $48.3 million or $1.61 diluted earnings per share compared to $44.8 million and $1.49 per share in Q2 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.037 billion, which was roughly unchanged from the end of Q1 of 2020. During the second quarter, our inventory increased by about $71 million from Q1 of 2020 levels. The increase of inventory that we saw in Q2 of 2020 was driven by normalizing the level of our safety stock resulting from the cyber attack in late Q4 of 2019, and our decision to secure additional components given the supply chain disruption that we experienced during the earlier part of the year. We expect to reduce inventory levels over the next 3 quarters. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. 
In July, our Board refreshed our capacity authorizing a $200 million increase to our share buyback program, and we now have a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. For the second quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $92.1 million, which compares to $155 million in Q2 of 2019. This reduction mainly reflects the change in working capital and the timing of the Sartorius dividend tails. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.6% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 16.9%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2019 was 16%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2020 were $18.1 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $34.7 million. 
Moving on to the guidance. We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that said, we currently believe that the third quarter year-over-year currency-neutral sales may be flat to up 5%. This assumes that the third quarter will see a gradual improvement from June levels, a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19 related product sales versus Q2 and the modest benefit from our serology test. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return to the workplace protocols. We continue to believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect gradual recovery in the second half of the year, but currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

They're using the platform because it's highly sensitive and very precise. It's being used by governmental agencies for environmental monitoring, public safety for swimming areas. So I think we're seeing an uptick there, people getting monitoring for those reasons are now saying, gee, maybe we should be looking to monitor for SARS. So I think we're going to get some lasting kind of customers in that area as well."

And I'd like to start by taking a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize our employees around the world who continue to make extraordinary efforts to serve our customers under the current circumstances. So thank you to all of our employees for your dedication and continued commitment to the company. Your efforts are truly appreciated. So since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been focused on 3 key areas to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
On employee safety, we have worked hard to put measures in place to guard the well-being and safety of our employees. Early on, we implemented work-from-home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and core R&D. And we continue to have this policy in place in the U.S. In Asia, return back to the workplace resumed relatively faster than the rest of our regions, and we are now starting to see resumption in Europe as well. We have requirements in place for social distancing, wearing of masks, temperature checks, contact tracing and, of course, remote working from home depending on the region. All of these measures have served to minimize the number of cases we have experienced throughout Bio-Rad.
Our manufacturing operations team have also responded extremely well. Early on in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruptions as we ramped up production to meet the increased demand of mainly our PCR instruments, but reagents, too. Today, we are in a more appropriately scaled position to meet demand, and we have room to continue expanding production should the need arise.
Lastly, with much time and energy were spent initially to manage through the impacts of the global pandemic, we have adjusted extremely well to the new working environments and believe that we have executed well given the situation. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies and look forward to sharing more details later this year. So with that overview, I'd like to pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis,",1609,"Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales decreased 4.4%. On a regional basis, strength in Asia was offset by weakness in other regions. As Andy alluded, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $71 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2020 were $252.1 million compared to $212.4 million in Q2 of 2019, which is an 18.7% increase on a reported basis and a 20% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth in the second quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand for COVID-19-related products. Growth in the -- overall in the Life Science segment was offset by softer academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating materially below capacity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw significant year-over-year growth in the quarter, which was primarily due to an easy compare over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2019.
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe, while the Americas were about flat. We continue to be excited about our Droplet Digital PCR platforms. The unique sensitivity and specificity of the technology continues to open up new opportunities and applications.
During the current pandemic, it is being deployed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater streams. Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in the second quarter were $283.2 million compared to $357.1 million in Q2 of 2019, which is a 20.7% decline on a reported basis and an 18.7% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, Clinical Diagnostics segment experienced weakness across all of its product lines due to the reduced demand from lower noncritical hospital and clinic visits. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. We continue to execute on our new product development strategy. We launched in the second quarter, GelDoc Go Imaging System, which provides a benchtop imaging solution in a compact and automated package.
We also launched a new label claim for our Geenius HIV 1/HIV 2 Supplemental say, which is now approved by the FDA for using blood and plasma donation center settings. 
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 54.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.7% in Q2 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and higher utilization, partially offset by an $8 million customs duty charge taken in the quarter relating to products shipped primarily in prior years. This $8 million expense impacted the gross margin by about 150 basis points. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $5 million compared to $3.8 million in Q2 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2020 were $189.3 million or 35.3% of sales compared to $201.3 million or 35.1% in Q2 of 2019. Reduction in SG&A expenses was the result of disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, primarily travel and marketing expenses, due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. The year-over-year decrease on a dollar basis was $12 million, and we expect that most of the discretionary cost savings will gradually come back over the coming quarters as we return back to the workplace.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.6 million in Q2 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q2 was $52 million or 9.7% of sales compared to $50.1 million or 8.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Q2 operating income was $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $56.4 million or 9.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings, added $1.183 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $10.7 million compared to $3.2 million of expense last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.
In 2019, the dividend was declared in March and was paid in April.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.2% in Q2 of 2019. Reported net income for the second quarter was $966.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $32.15. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and the negligible restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.5% versus 54.4% in Q2 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 was 33.9% versus 34.5% in Q2 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization and purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $2.6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $2.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.8% versus 8.8% in Q2 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded about $700,000 restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.6% on a GAAP basis to 11.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2019 of 11.1%. We have excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.183 billion, a $1.1 million of loss associated with venture investments and an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a small noncore business that was part of our other operations segment. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared to 26.5% in Q2 of 2019. The decrease in rate was driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $48.3 million or $1.61 diluted earnings per share compared to $44.8 million and $1.49 per share in Q2 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.037 billion, which was roughly unchanged from the end of Q1 of 2020. During the second quarter, our inventory increased by about $71 million from Q1 of 2020 levels. The increase of inventory that we saw in Q2 of 2020 was driven by normalizing the level of our safety stock resulting from the cyber-attack in late Q4 of 2019, and our decision to secure additional components given the supply chain disruption that we experienced during the earlier part of the year. We expect to reduce inventory levels over the next 3 quarters. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.
In July, our Board refreshed our capacity authorizing a $200 million increase to our share buyback program, and we now have a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. For the second quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $92.1 million, which compares to $155 million in Q2 of 2019. This reduction mainly reflects the change in working capital and the timing of the Sartorius dividend tails. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.6% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 16.9%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2019 was 16%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2020 were $18.1 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $34.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that said, we currently believe that the third quarter year-over-year currency-neutral sales may be flat to up 5%. This assumes that the third quarter will see a gradual improvement from June levels, a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q2 and the modest benefit from our serology test. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return to the workplace protocols. We continue to believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect gradual recovery in the second half of the year, but currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

And then if you look at the OpEx line, a significant amount of leverage in G&A in the second quarter, how much of that spend comes back into the model in the second half of the year?"

We can tell you, based on the last several months that a lot is happening every few weeks. So I don't know that the general seasonality that we experience every year will be similar this year. Thinking about the operating expenses. So most of the savings specifically this quarter are going to come back at some point, I mean, and it will take a few quarters. With that said, I can tell you that, obviously, that we will have to revisit kind of how do we spend the discretionary expenses, and how do we manage potentially with less travel, et cetera. 
So if I have to kind of categorize it, most of it is still associated with discretionary, specifically this quarter. Some of it is associated with our long-term initiatives to reduce our operating expenses. And as you can see also on the R&D side, we continue to invest on a dollar basis, actually, it was slightly higher. We do not have any intention to reduce our R&D investments."

We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business.
The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.

And I'd like to start by taking a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize our employees around the world who continue to make extraordinary efforts to serve our customers under the current circumstances. So thank you to all of our employees for your dedication and continued commitment to the company. Your efforts are truly appreciated. So since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been focused on 3 key areas to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
On employee safety, we have worked hard to put measures in place to guard the well-being and safety of our employees. Early on, we implemented work-from-home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and core R&D. And we continue to have this policy in place in the U.S. In Asia, return back to the workplace resumed relatively faster than the rest of our regions, and we are now starting to see resumption in Europe as well. We have requirements in place for social distancing, wearing of masks, temperature checks, contact tracing and, of course, remote working from home depending on the region. All of these measures have served to minimize the number of cases we have experienced throughout Bio-Rad.
Our manufacturing operations team have also responded extremely well. Early on in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruptions as we ramped up production to meet the increased demand of mainly our PCR instruments, but reagents, too. Today, we are in a more appropriately scaled position to meet demand, and we have room to continue expanding production should the need arise.
Lastly, with much time and energy were spent initially to manage through the impacts of the global pandemic, we have adjusted extremely well to the new working environments and believe that we have executed well given the situation. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies and look forward to sharing more details later this year. So with that overview, I'd like to pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis,",1610,"Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales decreased 4.4%. On a regional basis, strength in Asia was offset by weakness in other regions. As Andy alluded, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $71 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2020 were $252.1 million compared to $212.4 million in Q2 of 2019, which is an 18.7% increase on a reported basis and a 20% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth in the second quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand for COVID-19-related products. Growth in the -- overall in the Life Science segment was offset by softer academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating materially below capacity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw significant year-over-year growth in the quarter, which was primarily due to an easy compare over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2019.
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe, while the Americas were about flat. We continue to be excited about our Droplet Digital PCR platforms. The unique sensitivity and specificity of the technology continues to open up new opportunities and applications.
During the current pandemic, it is being deployed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater streams. Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in the second quarter were $283.2 million compared to $357.1 million in Q2 of 2019, which is a 20.7% decline on a reported basis and an 18.7% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, Clinical Diagnostics segment experienced weakness across all of its product lines due to the reduced demand from lower noncritical hospital and clinic visits. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. We continue to execute on our new product development strategy. We launched in the second quarter the GelDoc Go Imaging System, which provides a benchtop imaging solution in a compact and automated package.
We also launched a new label claim for our Geenius HIV 1/HIV 2 Supplemental say, which is now approved by the FDA for using blood and plasma donation center settings. 
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 54.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.7% in Q2 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and higher utilization, partially offset by an $8 million customs duty charge taken in the quarter relating to products shipped primarily in prior years. This $8 million expense impacted the gross margin by about 150 basis points. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $5 million compared to $3.8 million in Q2 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2020 were $189.3 million or 35.3% of sales compared to $201.3 million or 35.1% in Q2 of 2019. Reduction in SG&A expenses was the result of disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, primarily travel and marketing expenses, due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. The year-over-year decrease on a dollar basis was $12 million, and we expect that most of the discretionary cost savings will gradually come back over the coming quarters as we return back to the workplace.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.6 million in Q2 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q2 was $52 million or 9.7% of sales compared to $50.1 million or 8.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Q2 operating income was $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $56.4 million or 9.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings, added $1.183 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $10.7 million compared to $3.2 million of expense last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.
In 2019, the dividend was declared in March and was paid in April.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.2% in Q2 of 2019. Reported net income for the second quarter was $966.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $32.15. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and the negligible restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.5% versus 54.4% in Q2 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 was 33.9% versus 34.5% in Q2 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization and purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $2.6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $2.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.8% versus 8.8% in Q2 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded about $700,000 restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.6% on a GAAP basis to 11.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2019 of 11.1%. We have excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.183 billion, a $1.1 million of loss associated with venture investments and an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a small noncore business that was part of our other operations segment. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared to 26.5% in Q2 of 2019. The decrease in rate was driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $48.3 million or $1.61 diluted earnings per share compared to $44.8 million and $1.49 per share in Q2 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.037 billion, which was roughly unchanged from the end of Q1 of 2020. During the second quarter, our inventory increased by about $71 million from Q1 of 2020 levels. The increase of inventory that we saw in Q2 of 2020 was driven by normalizing the level of our safety stock resulting from the cyber-attack in late Q4 of 2019, and our decision to secure additional components given the supply chain disruption that we experienced during the earlier part of the year. We expect to reduce inventory levels over the next 3 quarters. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.
In July, our Board refreshed our capacity authorizing a $200 million increase to our share buyback program, and we now have a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. For the second quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $92.1 million, which compares to $155 million in Q2 of 2019. This reduction mainly reflects the change in working capital and the timing of the Sartorius dividend tails. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.6% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 16.9%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2019 was 16%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2020 were $18.1 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $34.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that said, we currently believe that the third quarter year-over-year currency-neutral sales may be flat to up 5%. This assumes that the third quarter will see a gradual improvement from June levels, a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q2 and the modest benefit from our serology test. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return to the workplace protocols. We continue to believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect gradual recovery in the second half of the year, but currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations, and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations, and the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.
We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business.
The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles.

And I'd like to start by taking a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize our employees around the world who continue to make extraordinary efforts to serve our customers under the current circumstances. So thank you to all of our employees for your dedication and continued commitment to the company. Your efforts are truly appreciated. So since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been focused on 3 key areas to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
On employee safety, we have worked hard to put measures in place to guard the well-being and safety of our employees. Early on, we implemented work-from-home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and core R&D. And we continue to have this policy in place in the U.S. In Asia, return back to the workplace resumed relatively faster than the rest of our regions, and we are now starting to see resumption in Europe as well. We have requirements in place for social distancing, wearing of masks, temperature checks, contact tracing and, of course, remote working from home depending on the region. All of these measures have served to minimize the number of cases we have experienced throughout Bio-Rad.
Our manufacturing operations team have also responded extremely well. Early on in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruptions as we ramped up production to meet the increased demand of mainly our PCR instruments, but reagents, too. Today, we are in a more appropriately scaled position to meet demand, and we have room to continue expanding production should the need arise.
Lastly, with much time and energy were spent initially to manage through the impacts of the global pandemic, we have adjusted extremely well to the new working environments and believe that we have executed well given the situation. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies and look forward to sharing more details later this year. So with that overview, I'd like to pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."
255743,677194612,2056045,"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2020",2020-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis,",1610,"Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales decreased 4.4%. On a regional basis, strength in Asia was offset by weakness in other regions. As Andy alluded, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $71 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2020 were $252.1 million compared to $212.4 million in Q2 of 2019, which is an 18.7% increase on a reported basis and a 20% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth in the second quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand for COVID-19-related products. Growth in the -- overall in the Life Science segment was offset by softer academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating materially below capacity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw significant year-over-year growth in the quarter, which was primarily due to an easy compare over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2019.
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe, while the Americas were about flat. We continue to be excited about our Droplet Digital PCR platforms. The unique sensitivity and specificity of the technology continues to open up new opportunities and applications.
During the current pandemic, it is being deployed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater streams. Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in the second quarter were $283.2 million compared to $357.1 million in Q2 of 2019, which is a 20.7% decline on a reported basis and an 18.7% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, Clinical Diagnostics segment experienced weakness across all of its product lines due to the reduced demand from lower noncritical hospital and clinic visits. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. We continue to execute on our new product development strategy. We launched in the second quarter the GelDoc Go Imaging System, which provides a benchtop imaging solution in a compact and automated package.
We also launched a new label claim for our Geenius HIV 1/HIV 2 Supplemental say, which is now approved by the FDA for using blood and plasma donation center settings. 
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 54.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.7% in Q2 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and higher utilization, partially offset by an $8 million customs duty charge taken in the quarter relating to products shipped primarily in prior years. This $8 million expense impacted the gross margin by about 150 basis points. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $5 million compared to $3.8 million in Q2 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2020 were $189.3 million or 35.3% of sales compared to $201.3 million or 35.1% in Q2 of 2019. Reduction in SG&A expenses was the result of disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, primarily travel and marketing expenses, due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. The year-over-year decrease on a dollar basis was $12 million, and we expect that most of the discretionary cost savings will gradually come back over the coming quarters as we return back to the workplace.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.6 million in Q2 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q2 was $52 million or 9.7% of sales compared to $50.1 million or 8.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Q2 operating income was $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $56.4 million or 9.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings, added $1.183 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $10.7 million compared to $3.2 million of expense last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.
In 2019, the dividend was declared in March and was paid in April.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.2% in Q2 of 2019. Reported net income for the second quarter was $966.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $32.15. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and the negligible restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.5% versus 54.4% in Q2 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 was 33.9% versus 34.5% in Q2 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization and purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $2.6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $2.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.8% versus 8.8% in Q2 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded about $700,000 restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.6% on a GAAP basis to 11.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2019 of 11.1%. We have excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.183 billion, a $1.1 million of loss associated with venture investments and an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a small noncore business that was part of our other operations segment. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared to 26.5% in Q2 of 2019. The decrease in rate was driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $48.3 million or $1.61 diluted earnings per share compared to $44.8 million and $1.49 per share in Q2 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.037 billion, which was roughly unchanged from the end of Q1 of 2020. During the second quarter, our inventory increased by about $71 million from Q1 of 2020 levels. The increase of inventory that we saw in Q2 of 2020 was driven by normalizing the level of our safety stock resulting from the cyber-attack in late Q4 of 2019, and our decision to secure additional components given the supply chain disruption that we experienced during the earlier part of the year. We expect to reduce inventory levels over the next 3 quarters. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.
In July, our Board refreshed our capacity authorizing a $200 million increase to our share buyback program, and we now have a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. For the second quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $92.1 million, which compares to $155 million in Q2 of 2019. This reduction mainly reflects the change in working capital and the timing of the Sartorius dividend tails. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.6% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 16.9%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2019 was 16%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2020 were $18.1 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $34.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that said, we currently believe that the third quarter year-over-year currency-neutral sales may be flat to up 5%. This assumes that the third quarter will see a gradual improvement from June levels, a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q2 and the modest benefit from our serology test. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return to the workplace protocols. We continue to believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect gradual recovery in the second half of the year, but currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

With that said, I can tell you that, obviously, that we will have to revisit kind of how do we spend the discretionary expenses, and how do we manage potentially with less travel, et cetera. 
So if I have to kind of categorize it, most of it is still associated with discretionary, specifically this quarter. Some of it is associated with our long-term initiatives to reduce our operating expenses. And as you can see also on the R&D side, we continue to invest on a dollar basis, actually, it was slightly higher. We do not have any intention to reduce our R&D investment."

And I'd like to start by taking a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, I'd like to recognize our employees around the world who continue to make extraordinary efforts to serve our customers under the current circumstances. So thank you to all of our employees for your dedication and continued commitment to the company. Your efforts are truly appreciated. So since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been focused on 3 key areas to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees; continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers; and making sure we continue to make progress on our core strategies.
On employee safety, we have worked hard to put measures in place to guard the well-being and safety of our employees. Early on, we implemented work-from-home globally for all employees who are not essential to maintaining ongoing production and core R&D. And we continue to have this policy in place in the U.S. In Asia, return back to the workplace resumed relatively faster than the rest of our regions, and we are now starting to see resumption in Europe as well. We have requirements in place for social distancing, wearing of masks, temperature checks, contact tracing and, of course, remote working from home depending on the region. All of these measures have served to minimize the number of cases we have experienced throughout Bio-Rad.
Our manufacturing operations team have also responded extremely well. Early on in the pandemic, we experienced some supply chain disruptions as we ramped up production to meet the increased demand of mainly our PCR instruments, but reagents, too. Today, we are in a more appropriately scaled position to meet demand, and we have room to continue expanding production should the need arise.
Lastly, with much time and energy were spent initially to manage through the impacts of the global pandemic, we have adjusted extremely well to the new working environments and believe that we have executed well given the situation. We continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies and look forward to sharing more details later this year. So with that overview, I'd like to pass it back to Ilan. Thank you."

And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis,",1610,"Thank you, Andy. And now I would like to review the results of the second quarter. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were $536.9 million, which is a 6.2% decrease on a reported basis versus $572.6 million in Q2 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales decreased 4.4%. On a regional basis, strength in Asia was offset by weakness in other regions. As Andy alluded, the pandemic resulted in a significant change in the mix of product demand across our portfolio. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. We estimate that the COVID-19-related sales were about $71 million in the quarter. Sales of the Life Science Group in the second quarter of 2020 were $252.1 million compared to $212.4 million in Q2 of 2019, which is an 18.7% increase on a reported basis and a 20% increase on a currency-neutral basis. 
The majority of the year-over-year growth in the second quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Our core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR products revenue increases were driven by strong demand for COVID-19-related products. Growth in the -- overall in the Life Science segment was offset by softer academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating materially below capacity. Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw significant year-over-year growth in the quarter, which was primarily due to an easy compare over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 14.1% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q2 of 2019.
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew in Asia and in Europe, while the Americas were about flat. We continue to be excited about our Droplet Digital PCR platforms. The unique sensitivity and specificity of the technology continues to open up new opportunities and applications.
During the current pandemic, it is being deployed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in wastewater streams. Sales of the Clinical Diagnostics products in the second quarter were $283.2 million compared to $357.1 million in Q2 of 2019, which is a 20.7% decline on a reported basis and an 18.7% decline on a currency-neutral basis. During the second quarter, Clinical Diagnostics segment experienced weakness across all of its product lines due to the reduced demand from lower noncritical hospital and clinic visits. On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. We continue to execute on our new product development strategy. We launched in the second quarter the GelDoc Go Imaging System, which provides a benchtop imaging solution in a compact and automated package.
We also launched a new label claim for our Geenius HIV 1/HIV 2 Supplemental say, which is now approved by the FDA for using blood and plasma donation center settings. 
The reported gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 54.6% on a GAAP basis and compares to 53.7% in Q2 of 2019. The current quarter gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix and higher utilization, partially offset by an $8 million customs duty charge taken in the quarter relating to products shipped primarily in prior years. This $8 million expense impacted the gross margin by about 150 basis points. Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $5 million compared to $3.8 million in Q2 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q2 of 2020 were $189.3 million or 35.3% of sales compared to $201.3 million or 35.1% in Q2 of 2019. Reduction in SG&A expenses was the result of disciplined hiring and lower discretionary spend, primarily travel and marketing expenses, due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as ongoing cost savings initiatives. The year-over-year decrease on a dollar basis was $12 million, and we expect that most of the discretionary cost savings will gradually come back over the coming quarters as we return back to the workplace.
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.6 million in Q2 of 2019. Research and development expense in Q2 was $52 million or 9.7% of sales compared to $50.1 million or 8.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. Q2 operating income was $51.7 million or 9.6% of sales compared to $56.4 million or 9.8% of sales in Q2 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings, added $1.183 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to the holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in net other income of $10.7 million compared to $3.2 million of expense last year. Q2 of 2020 includes an $8.9 million dividend from Sartorius, which was declared in June and was paid in July.
In 2019, the dividend was declared in March and was paid in April.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.2% in Q2 of 2019. Reported net income for the second quarter was $966.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $32.15. This is an increase from last year and is substantially related to changes in valuation of the Sartorius Holdings.
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the second quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $5 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and the negligible restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 55.5% versus 54.4% in Q2 of 2019. Non-GAAP SG&A in the second quarter of 2020 was 33.9% versus 34.5% in Q2 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization and purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $2.6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related costs of $2.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense in the second quarter of 2020 was 9.8% versus 8.8% in Q2 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded about $700,000 restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 9.6% on a GAAP basis to 11.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 of 2019 of 11.1%. We have excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius equity holdings of $1.183 billion, a $1.1 million of loss associated with venture investments and an $11.7 million gain on the sale of a small noncore business that was part of our other operations segment. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared to 26.5% in Q2 of 2019. The decrease in rate was driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. And finally, non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $48.3 million or $1.61 diluted earnings per share compared to $44.8 million and $1.49 per share in Q2 of 2019.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2 were $1.037 billion, which was roughly unchanged from the end of Q1 of 2020. During the second quarter, our inventory increased by about $71 million from Q1 of 2020 levels. The increase of inventory that we saw in Q2 of 2020 was driven by normalizing the level of our safety stock resulting from the cyber-attack in late Q4 of 2019, and our decision to secure additional components given the supply chain disruption that we experienced during the earlier part of the year. We expect to reduce inventory levels over the next 3 quarters. During the second quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock.
In July, our Board refreshed our capacity authorizing a $200 million increase to our share buyback program, and we now have a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. For the second quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $92.1 million, which compares to $155 million in Q2 of 2019. This reduction mainly reflects the change in working capital and the timing of the Sartorius dividend tails. The adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was 18.6% of sales, and excluding the Sartorius dividend, was 16.9%. The adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2019 was 16%. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2020 were $18.1 million, and depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $34.7 million.
Moving on to the guidance. We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With that said, we currently believe that the third quarter year-over-year currency-neutral sales may be flat to up 5%. This assumes that the third quarter will see a gradual improvement from June levels, a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q2 and the modest benefit from our serology test. We continue to assess various demand and supply indicators as well as return to the workplace protocols. We continue to believe that the COVID-19 impact will be transitory, and we would expect gradual recovery in the second half of the year, but currently, it is difficult to predict the rate of recovery that we might experience. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Operator?"

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, we would like to recognize our employees globally who have continued to work above and beyond to serve our customers during the pandemic. We truly appreciate the hard work and dedication across our organization. 
As a reminder, we have 3 key areas of focus as we continue to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers and making sure we make progress on our core strategies. We have now established routine practices around the world to improve employee safety. We have adapted our policies and approaches to local conditions and requirements, and I'm very pleased with the productivity we have been able to achieve. 
Work from home continues where required. And for those in our facilities, we are continuing to implement broad safety procedures and we continue to experience minimized case numbers. 
In the U.S., we have now implemented a fast turnaround testing solution for suspected cases using a droplet digital PCR test and can rapidly deliver results back to an employee. This has enabled us to avoid significant work downtime summing to over a full year productivity equivalent so far. 
In manufacturing, our operations teams continue to be flexible in meeting the demand shift driven by the pandemic. We have Flex well to meet the high demand for our PCR products, which increased in Q3, and we have scaled back where needed, mainly for our diagnostics products. We are now past the majority of the initial scale up issues we encountered with supply chain disruption early in the pandemic and believe we are well positioned to meet future needs. 
Lastly, we continue to work on our core initiatives and strategies, in particular, in R&D, where we now have all our labs operational. 
Thank you. And now and I'll pass it back to Ilan."

Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1776,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased a 14.9%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral sales growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. Overall, in Q3, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for both our Life Science and Diagnostics products in all regions as compared to Q2. 
Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity and slowly continuing to improve. Biopharma labs are broadly running at a slightly higher capacity rate of 80% to 90%, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. 
We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $98 million in the quarter. 
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2020 were $324 million compared to $215.7 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 50.2% increase on a reported basis and a 48.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The majority of the year-over-year growth in the third quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR, and Process Media. Both core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR product revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2019. The growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in the academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating below capacity. We expect a continued gradual increase in laboratories utilization and are carefully monitoring the situation. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. We continue to be encouraged by our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is becoming more broadly adopted in wastewater testing as the gold standard. Droplet Digital PCR is now being used at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Water Research Foundation and more than 2 dozen labs globally for wastewater testing, including the state of Michigan, which is establishing a standardized and coordinated network of COVID-19 monitoring systems across the state. 
In addition, last month, we launched 2 new PCR systems: the CFX Opus 96 and the CFX Opus 384, which strengthens our global response and contribution to the fight against the pandemic. With the launch of the CFX Opus systems, Bio-Rad also introduced access to a cloud-based instrument connectivity, data management and analysis platform. These new PCR systems, along with our Droplet Digital PCR offering, provides a complete solution for our customers. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the third quarter were $322.2 million compared to $341.8 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 5.7% decline on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency-neutral basis. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced improved performance across all regions and product lines, and we believe this reflects the recovery of routine testing trends. During the third quarter, strength in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the diagnostics portfolio. Although clinical labs have seen a significant negative impact by the pandemic, we are now experiencing a gradual recovery from the trough of Q2 and expect incremental recovery into the end of the year. We will be closely monitoring the potential impact of the recent and then increased surgeons. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.8% in Q3 of 2019. The current gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, higher manufacturing utilization and lower service cost, tempered somewhat by higher logistics cost. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million compared to $3.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 of 2019. We continue with cost-saving initiatives to reduce our SG&A. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Q3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 of 2019. Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.58 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million compared to $2.1 million of expense last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 22.8% in Q3 of 2019. 
Reported net income for the third quarter was $1.315 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $43.64. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to the changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% versus 56% in Q3 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4% versus 35.5% in Q3 of 2019. 
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $6 million and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of less than $1 million. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2% versus 8.5% in Q3 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a negligible restructuring benefit. The cumulative some of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% on a GAAP basis to 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 of 2019 of 12%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $1.580 billion and a small loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% and compared to 25.5% in Q3 of 2019. The lower rate this quarter was primarily driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings, and the taxation of our foreign earnings. 
We now estimate the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 24%. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $90.3 million or $3 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.160 billion, an increase of $123 million from the end of Q2 of 2020. 
During the third quarter, our inventory increased by about $12 million from the second quarter of 2020. The increase of inventory in Q3 of 2020 and was driven by the continued expectation of higher demand for COVID-19-related products. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
We plan to use the cash on hand to repay the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December. 
In addition, the market value of our holdings in Sartorius AG has increased, which technically may deem us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act. While we are working on the resolution, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, we feel that we have adequate resources to effectively run our business in the near term. 
During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
For the third quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $135.7 million, which compares to $99.8 million in Q3 of 2019. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2019 was 17%. 
Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2020 were $20 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million. 
We project that the full year CapEx spend will likely be between $80 million and $90 million. Moving on to the guidance. 
We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we do assume a gradual return to pre pandemic activity levels and business mix. With that in mind, we currently believe that the full year 2020 year-over-year currency-neutral sales to be up 5.9% to 6.3%. We estimate 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and estimate about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020. This assumes that the fourth quarter will see a gradual improvement in non-COVID-19-related product sales and a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q3. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 56.5% and 57%, r&D at around 9%, full year GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 21.5%. 
Our significantly higher operating profit over last year was driven by discretionary cost control measures and better product mix. As our operations begin to return back to normal, we expect a gradual reversal of these benefits that we experienced in 2020. 
Lastly, due to the uncertain nature of the current pandemic, we will not host an Investor Day this year and instead look to host it in 2021 when business activity normalizes. With that said, in December, we plan on updating you with our revenue growth and margin targets. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions.

Thank you, Brandon. I'll start, and Andy will chime in. Generally speaking, we definitely continue to enjoy the some of the lower discretionary expenses, although some of these expenses did start to come back, but they definitely not at the level of pre-pandemic. So assuming that we'll get back to pre-pandemic level, SG&A will continue to be higher from the prior quarter. And some of it was associated also with employee-related expenses. 
So if you think about the mid-30s level that we were there, we continue with our cost-saving initiatives that we started before the pandemic, and we are very successful in terms of realizing savings there. 
With that said, we believe that currently, we run below our normalized level of SG&A. So I expected some more kind of in between."

And we're doing some background work to try and understand the size of the market opportunity. But we think the need for surveillance to detect early community outbreak. Is likely to be a longer-term need, and we're very well positioned to support this with our ddPCR products. 
Yes, there are other technologies that you can use, but looking for that needle in the haystack in an environment with a lot of inhibitors, as you might imagine, is a situation that ddPCR can really serve quite well. So we're pleased with the uptake we've taken so far, and we're really taking a harder look at what the longer-term opportunity is. 
Second question -- oh, so non-COVID-19. Like the clinical diagnostics market, we're seeing some gradual return to normal. We're not quite there yet. But sequentially, we see the improvement of revenue coming in from our core products. And this means people are back at the lab doing experiments, western blooding, things like that. So we're optimistic. 
I think like our own R&D teams, I think research labs around the world are figuring out the right algorithm to have people come back in the lab and stay safe and get some work done. So I think we're starting to see that as part of the return to normal."

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations. And the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.
We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, we would like to recognize our employees globally who have continued to work above and beyond to serve our customers during the pandemic. We truly appreciate the hard work and dedication across our organization. 
As a reminder, we have 3 key areas of focus as we continue to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we make progress on our core strategies. We have now established routine practices around the world to improve employees' safety. We have adapted our policies and approaches to local conditions and requirements, and I'm very pleased with the productivity we have been able to achieve. 
Work from home continues where required. And for those in our facilities, we are continuing to implement broad safety procedures, and we continue to experience minimized case numbers. In the U.S., we have now implemented a fast turnaround testing solution for suspected cases using a droplet digital PCR test and can rapidly deliver results back to an employee. This has enabled us to avoid significant work downtime, summing to over a full year productivity equivalent so far. 
In manufacturing, our operations teams continue to be flexible in meeting the demand shift driven by the pandemic. We have flexed well to meet the high demand for our PCR products, which increased in Q3, and we have scaled back where needed, mainly for our diagnostics products. We are now past the majority of the initial scale-up issues we encountered with supply chain disruption early in the pandemic and believe we are well positioned to meet future needs.
Lastly, we continued to work on our core initiatives and strategies, in particular, in R&D, where we now have all our labs operational.

255743,692339371,2123036,"Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Oct 29, 2020",2020-10-29,"Earnings Calls","Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1770,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 14.9%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. 
Overall, in Q3, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for both our Life Science and Diagnostics products in our regions as compared to Q2. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity and slowly continuing to improve. Biopharma labs are broadly running at a slightly higher capacity rate of 80% to 90%, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. 
We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $98 million in the quarter. 
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2020 were $324 million compared to $215.7 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 50.2% increase on a reported basis and a 48.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The majority of the year-over-year growth in the third quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Both core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR product revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in the academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating below capacity. We expect a continued gradual increase in lab utilization and are carefully monitoring the situation. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. We continue to be encouraged by our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is becoming more broadly adopted in wastewater testing as the gold standard. Droplet Digital PCR is now being used at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Water Research Foundation and more than 2 dozen labs globally for wastewater testing, including the State of Michigan, which is establishing a standardized and coordinated network of COVID-19 monitoring systems across the state.
In addition, last month, we launched 2 new PCR systems: the CFX Opus 96 and the CFX Opus 384, which strengthens our global response and contribution to the fight against the pandemic. With the launch of the CFX Opus systems, Bio-Rad also introduced access to a cloud-based instrument connectivity, data management and analysis platform. These new PCR systems, along with our Droplet Digital PCR offering, provides a complete solution for our customers. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the third quarter were $322.2 million compared to $341.8 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 5.7% decline on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency-neutral basis. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced improved performance across all regions and product lines, and we believe this reflects the recovery of routine testing trends. During the third quarter, strength in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the diagnostics portfolio. Although clinical labs have seen a significant negative impact by the pandemic, we are now experiencing a gradual recovery from the trough of Q2 and expect incremental recovery into the end of the year. We will be closely monitoring the potential impact of the recent and then increased surgeons. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.8% in Q3 of 2019. The current gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, higher manufacturing utilization and lower service cost, tempered somewhat by higher logistics cost. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million compared to $3.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 of 2019. We continue with cost-saving initiatives to reduce our SG&A. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Q3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.58 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million compared to $2.1 million of expense last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 22.8% in Q3 of 2019. 
Reported net income for the third quarter was $1.315 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $43.64. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to the changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% versus 56% in Q3 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4% versus 35.5% in Q3 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $6 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of less than $1 million. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2% versus 8.5% in Q3 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a negligible restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% on a GAAP basis to 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 of 2019 of 12%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $1.580 billion and a small loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% compared to 25.5% in Q3 of 2019. The lower rate this quarter was primarily driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. 
We now estimate the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 24%. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $90.3 million or $3 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.160 billion, an increase of $123 million from the end of Q2 of 2020. 
During the third quarter, our inventory increased by about $12 million from the second quarter of 2020. The increase of inventory in Q3 of 2020 was driven by the continued expectation of higher demand for COVID-19-related products. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
We plan to use the cash on hand to repay the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December. 
In addition, the market value of our holdings in Sartorius AG has increased, which technically may deem us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act. While we are working on the resolution, our access to the capital markets may be restricted. We feel that we have adequate resources to effectively run our business in the near term. 
During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
For the third quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $135.7 million, which compares to $99.8 million in Q3 of 2019. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2019 was 17%. 
Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2020 were $20 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million. 
We project that the full year CapEx spend will likely be between $80 million and $90 million. Moving on to the guidance. 
We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we do assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and business mix. With that in mind, we currently believe that the full year 2020 year-over-year currency-neutral sales to be up 5.9% to 6.3%. We estimate 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and estimate about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020. This assumes that the fourth quarter will see a gradual improvement in non-COVID-19-related product sales and a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q3. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 56.5% and 57%, R&D at around 9%, full year GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 21.5%. 
Our significantly higher operating profit over last year was driven by discretionary cost control measures and better product mix. As our operations begin to return back to normal, we expect a gradual reversal of these benefits that we experienced in 2020. 
Lastly, due to the uncertain nature of the current pandemic, we will not host an Investor Day this year and instead look to host it in 2021 when business activity normalizes. With that said, in December, we plan on updating you with our revenue growth and margin targets. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Christy?"

And we're doing some background work to try and understand the size of the market opportunity. But we think the need for surveillance to detect early community outbreak is likely to be a longer-term need, and we're very well positioned to support this with our ddPCR products. 
Yes, there are other technologies that you can use, but looking for that needle in the haystack in an environment with a lot of inhibitors, as you might imagine, is a situation that ddPCR can really serve quite well. So we're pleased with the uptake we've taken so far, and we're really taking a harder look at what the longer-term opportunity is. 
Second question -- oh, so non-COVID. Like the clinical diagnostics market, we're seeing some gradual return to normal. We're not quite there yet. But sequentially, we see the improvement of revenue coming in from our core products. And this means people are back at the lab doing experiments, western blooding, things like that. So we're optimistic.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, we would like to recognize our employees globally who have continued to work above and beyond to serve our customers during the pandemic. We truly appreciate the hard work and dedication across our organization. 
As a reminder, we have 3 key areas of focus as we continue to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we make progress on our core strategies. We have now established routine practices around the world to improve employees' safety. We have adapted our policies and approaches to local conditions and requirements, and I'm very pleased with the productivity we have been able to achieve. 
Work from home continues where required. And for those in our facilities, we are continuing to implement broad safety procedures, and we continue to experience minimized case numbers. In the U.S., we have now implemented a fast turnaround testing solution for suspected cases using a droplet digital PCR test and can rapidly deliver results back to an employee. This has enabled us to avoid significant work downtime, summing to over a full year productivity equivalent so far. 
In manufacturing, our operations teams continue to be flexible in meeting the demand shift driven by the pandemic. We have flexed well to meet the high demand for our PCR products, which increased in Q3, and we have scaled back where needed, mainly for our diagnostics products. We are now past the majority of the initial scale-up issues we encountered with supply chain disruption early in the pandemic and believe we are well positioned to meet future needs.
Lastly, we continued to work on our core initiatives and strategies, in particular, in R&D, where we now have all our labs operational.

Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1770,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 14.9%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. 
Overall, in Q3, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for both our Life Science and Diagnostics products in our regions as compared to Q2. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity and slowly continuing to improve. Biopharma labs are broadly running at a slightly higher capacity rate of 80% to 90%, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. 
We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $98 million in the quarter. 
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2020 were $324 million compared to $215.7 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 50.2% increase on a reported basis and a 48.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The majority of the year-over-year growth in the third quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Both core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR product revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in the academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating below capacity. We expect a continued gradual increase in lab utilization and are carefully monitoring the situation. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. We continue to be encouraged by our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is becoming more broadly adopted in wastewater testing as the gold standard. Droplet Digital PCR is now being used at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Water Research Foundation and more than 2 dozen labs globally for wastewater testing, including the State of Michigan, which is establishing a standardized and coordinated network of COVID-19 monitoring systems across the state.
In addition, last month, we launched 2 new PCR systems: the CFX Opus 96 and the CFX Opus 384, which strengthens our global response and contribution to the fight against the pandemic. With the launch of the CFX Opus systems, Bio-Rad also introduced access to a cloud-based instrument connectivity, data management and analysis platform. These new PCR systems, along with our Droplet Digital PCR offering, provides a complete solution for our customers. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the third quarter were $322.2 million compared to $341.8 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 5.7% decline on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency-neutral basis. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced improved performance across all regions and product lines, and we believe this reflects the recovery of routine testing trends. During the third quarter, strength in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the diagnostics portfolio. Although clinical labs have seen a significant negative impact by the pandemic, we are now experiencing a gradual recovery from the trough of Q2 and expect incremental recovery into the end of the year. We will be closely monitoring the potential impact of the recent and then increased surgeons. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.8% in Q3 of 2019. The current gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, higher manufacturing utilization and lower service cost, tempered somewhat by higher logistics cost. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million compared to $3.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 of 2019. We continue with cost-saving initiatives to reduce our SG&A. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Q3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.58 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million compared to $2.1 million of expense last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 22.8% in Q3 of 2019. 
Reported net income for the third quarter was $1.315 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $43.64. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to the changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% versus 56% in Q3 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4% versus 35.5% in Q3 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $6 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of less than $1 million. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2% versus 8.5% in Q3 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a negligible restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% on a GAAP basis to 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 of 2019 of 12%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $1.580 billion and a small loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% compared to 25.5% in Q3 of 2019. The lower rate this quarter was primarily driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. 
We now estimate the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 24%. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $90.3 million or $3 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.160 billion, an increase of $123 million from the end of Q2 of 2020. 
During the third quarter, our inventory increased by about $12 million from the second quarter of 2020. The increase of inventory in Q3 of 2020 was driven by the continued expectation of higher demand for COVID-19-related products. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
We plan to use the cash on hand to repay the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December. 
In addition, the market value of our holdings in Sartorius AG has increased, which technically may deem us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act. While we are working on the resolution, our access to the capital markets may be restricted. We feel that we have adequate resources to effectively run our business in the near term. 
During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
For the third quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $135.7 million, which compares to $99.8 million in Q3 of 2019. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2019 was 17%. 
Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2020 were $20 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million. 
We project that the full year CapEx spend will likely be between $80 million and $90 million. Moving on to the guidance. 
We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we do assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and business mix. With that in mind, we currently believe that the full year 2020 year-over-year currency-neutral sales to be up 5.9% to 6.3%. We estimate 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and estimate about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020. This assumes that the fourth quarter will see a gradual improvement in non-COVID-19-related product sales and a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q3. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 56.5% and 57%, R&D at around 9%, full year GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 21.5%. 
Our significantly higher operating profit over last year was driven by discretionary cost control measures and better product mix. As our operations begin to return back to normal, we expect a gradual reversal of these benefits that we experienced in 2020. 
Lastly, due to the uncertain nature of the current pandemic, we will not host an Investor Day this year and instead look to host it in 2021 when business activity normalizes. With that said, in December, we plan on updating you with our revenue growth and margin targets. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Christy?"

And we're doing some background work to try and understand the size of the market opportunity. But we think the need for surveillance to detect early community outbreak is likely to be a longer-term need, and we're very well positioned to support this with our ddPCR products. 
Yes, there are other technologies that you can use, but looking for that needle in the haystack in an environment with a lot of inhibitors, as you might imagine, is a situation that ddPCR can really serve quite well. So we're pleased with the uptake we've taken so far, and we're really taking a harder look at what the longer-term opportunity is. 
Second question -- oh, so non-COVID. Like the clinical diagnostics market, we're seeing some gradual return to normal. We're not quite there yet. But sequentially, we see the improvement of revenue coming in from our core products. And this means people are back at the lab doing experiments, western blooding, things like that. So we're optimistic.

Before we begin our review, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about management's goals, plans and expectations, our future financial performance and other matters. These statements are based on assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Included in these forward-looking statements are statements regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Bio-Rad's results and operations and steps Bio-Rad is taking in response to the pandemic. Our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations. And the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown.
We cannot be certain that Bio-Rad's responses to the pandemic will be successful, that the demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-19-related products is sustainable or that Bio-Rad will be able to meet this demand. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC, where we discuss in detail the risk factors in our business. The company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements made during the call today. 
Our remarks today will also include references to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted income per share, which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP results contained in our earnings release.

So I'd like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world. Before I begin, we would like to recognize our employees globally who have continued to work above and beyond to serve our customers during the pandemic. We truly appreciate the hard work and dedication across our organization. 
As a reminder, we have 3 key areas of focus as we continue to manage through this challenging period: the ongoing safety of our employees, continuing manufacturing operations to ensure product supply and support of our customers, and making sure we make progress on our core strategies. We have now established routine practices around the world to improve employees' safety. We have adapted our policies and approaches to local conditions and requirements, and I'm very pleased with the productivity we have been able to achieve. 
Work from home continues where required. And for those in our facilities, we are continuing to implement broad safety procedures, and we continue to experience minimized case numbers. In the U.S., we have now implemented a fast turnaround testing solution for suspected cases using a droplet digital PCR test and can rapidly deliver results back to an employee. This has enabled us to avoid significant work downtime, summing to over a full year productivity equivalent so far. 
In manufacturing, our operations teams continue to be flexible in meeting the demand shift driven by the pandemic. We have flexed well to meet the high demand for our PCR products, which increased in Q3, and we have scaled back where needed, mainly for our diagnostics products. We are now past the majority of the initial scale-up issues we encountered with supply chain disruption early in the pandemic and believe we are well positioned to meet future needs.
Lastly, we continued to work on our core initiatives and strategies, in particular, in R&D, where we now have all our labs operational. 
Thank you. And now I'll pass it back to Ilan."

Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter.

On a currency-neutral basis, sale",1770,"Thank you, Andy. Now I would like to review the results of the third quarter. Net sales for the third quarter of 2020 were $647.3 million, which is a 15.5% increase on a reported basis versus $560.6 million in Q3 of 2019. On a currency-neutral basis, sales increased 14.9%. On a geographic basis, we experienced currency-neutral growth across all 3 regions. We saw strong demand for products associated with COVID-19 testing and related research. However, we saw lower demand in the rest of our business. 
Overall, in Q3, we have seen a gradual improvement in demand for both our Life Science and Diagnostics products in our regions as compared to Q2. Generally, we are seeing most academic and diagnostics labs now running between 70% and 90% capacity and slowly continuing to improve. Biopharma labs are broadly running at a slightly higher capacity rate of 80% to 90%, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. 
We estimate that COVID-19-related sales were about $98 million in the quarter. 
Sales of the Life Science Group in the third quarter of 2020 were $324 million compared to $215.7 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 50.2% increase on a reported basis and a 48.8% increase on a currency-neutral basis. The majority of the year-over-year growth in the third quarter was driven by our core PCR products, Droplet Digital PCR and Process Media. Both core PCR and Droplet Digital PCR product revenue increases were largely COVID-19-related. 
Process Media, which can fluctuate on a quarterly basis, saw strong double-digit year-over-year growth in the quarter over the same quarter last year. Excluding Process Media sales, the Life Science business grew 53% on a currency-neutral basis versus Q3 of 2019. Growth in the overall Life Science segment was offset by continued softness in the academic research demand as these labs around the globe were operating below capacity. We expect a continued gradual increase in lab utilization and are carefully monitoring the situation. 
On a geographic basis, Life Science currency-neutral year-over-year sales grew across all regions. We continue to be encouraged by our Droplet Digital PCR business, which is becoming more broadly adopted in wastewater testing as the gold standard. Droplet Digital PCR is now being used at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Water Research Foundation and more than 2 dozen labs globally for wastewater testing, including the State of Michigan, which is establishing a standardized and coordinated network of COVID-19 monitoring systems across the state.
In addition, last month, we launched 2 new PCR systems: the CFX Opus 96 and the CFX Opus 384, which strengthens our global response and contribution to the fight against the pandemic. With the launch of the CFX Opus systems, Bio-Rad also introduced access to a cloud-based instrument connectivity, data management and analysis platform. These new PCR systems, along with our Droplet Digital PCR offering, provides a complete solution for our customers. 
Sales of Clinical Diagnostics products in the third quarter were $322.2 million compared to $341.8 million in Q3 of 2019, which is a 5.7% decline on a reported basis and a 5.9% decline on a currency-neutral basis. 
On a sequential basis, we experienced improved performance across all regions and product lines, and we believe this reflects the recovery of routine testing trends. During the third quarter, strength in our quality controls products was offset by weakness across the rest of the diagnostics portfolio. Although clinical labs have seen a significant negative impact by the pandemic, we are now experiencing a gradual recovery from the trough of Q2 and expect incremental recovery into the end of the year. We will be closely monitoring the potential impact of the recent and then increased surgeons. 
On a geographic basis, the Diagnostics Group posted declines across all regions. The reported gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 56.7% on a GAAP basis and compares to 54.8% in Q3 of 2019. The current gross margin benefited mainly from better product mix, higher manufacturing utilization and lower service cost, tempered somewhat by higher logistics cost. 
Amortization related to prior acquisitions recorded in cost of goods sold was $4.8 million compared to $3.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
SG&A expenses for Q3 of 2020 were $198.2 million or 30.6% of sales compared to $201.6 million or 36% in Q3 of 2019. We continue with cost-saving initiatives to reduce our SG&A. 
Total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in SG&A for the quarter was $2.3 million versus $1.9 million in Q3 of 2019. 
Research and development expense in Q3 was $59.5 million or 9.2% of sales compared to $47.9 million or 8.6% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Q3 operating income was $109.6 million or 16.9% of sales compared to $57.5 million or 10.2% of sales in Q3 of 2019. 
Looking below the operating line, the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $1.58 billion of income to the reported results and is substantially related to holdings of the shares of Sartorius AG. 
Also during the quarter, interest and other income resulted in a net expense of $5.5 million compared to $2.1 million of expense last year. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% compared to 22.8% in Q3 of 2019. 
Reported net income for the third quarter was $1.315 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $43.64. This is an increase from last year and is again substantially related to the changes in the valuation of Sartorius Holdings. 
Moving on to the non-GAAP results. Looking at the results on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded certain atypical and unique items that impacted both the gross and operating margins as well as other income. These items are detailed in the reconciliation table in the press release. 
Looking at the non-GAAP results for the third quarter. In cost of goods sold, we have excluded $4.8 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and a small restructuring benefit. These exclusions moved the gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 to a non-GAAP gross margin of 57.5% versus 56% in Q3 of 2019. 
Non-GAAP SG&A in the third quarter of 2020 was 29.4% versus 35.5% in Q3 of 2019.
In SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded amortization of purchased intangibles of $2.3 million, legal-related expenses of $6 million, and restructuring and acquisition-related benefits of less than $1 million. 
Non-GAAP R&D expense in the third quarter of 2020 was 9.2% versus 8.5% in Q3 of 2019. In R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, we have excluded a negligible restructuring benefit. The cumulative sum of these non-GAAP adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 16.9% on a GAAP basis to 18.8% on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP operating margin compares to a non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 of 2019 of 12%. 
We have also excluded certain items below the operating line, which are the increase in value of the Sartorius Equity Holdings of $1.580 billion and a small loss associated with venture investments. 
The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% compared to 25.5% in Q3 of 2019. The lower rate this quarter was primarily driven by a change in our geographic mix of earnings and the taxation of our foreign earnings. 
We now estimate the full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis to be approximately 24%. 
And finally, non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $90.3 million or $3 diluted earnings per share compared to $48.6 million and $1.61 per share in Q3 of 2019. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments at the end of Q3 were $1.160 billion, an increase of $123 million from the end of Q2 of 2020. 
During the third quarter, our inventory increased by about $12 million from the second quarter of 2020. The increase of inventory in Q3 of 2020 was driven by the continued expectation of higher demand for COVID-19-related products. We expect inventory levels to come down over the next 2 to 3 quarters. 
We plan to use the cash on hand to repay the $425 million of outstanding senior notes in December. 
In addition, the market value of our holdings in Sartorius AG has increased, which technically may deem us as an investment company under the 1940 Investment Company Act. While we are working on the resolution, our access to the capital markets may be restricted. We feel that we have adequate resources to effectively run our business in the near term. 
During the third quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our stock. We had a total of $273 million available for potential share buybacks. 
For the third quarter of 2020, net cash generated from operating activities was $135.7 million, which compares to $99.8 million in Q3 of 2019. 
The adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted EBITDA in Q3 of 2019 was 17%. 
Net capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2020 were $20 million, and depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $33.7 million. 
We project that the full year CapEx spend will likely be between $80 million and $90 million. Moving on to the guidance. 
We continue to be uncertain about the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we do assume a gradual return to pre-pandemic activity levels and business mix. With that in mind, we currently believe that the full year 2020 year-over-year currency-neutral sales to be up 5.9% to 6.3%. We estimate 27% to 28% currency-neutral revenue growth for Life Science and estimate about 7% currency-neutral revenue decline for the Diagnostics Group in 2020. This assumes that the fourth quarter will see a gradual improvement in non-COVID-19-related product sales and a smaller relative benefit of COVID-19-related product sales versus Q3. 
Full year non-GAAP gross margin is projected to be between 56.5% and 57%, R&D at around 9%, full year GAAP operating margin between 16% and 16.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 21% and 21.5%. 
Our significantly higher operating profit over last year was driven by discretionary cost control measures and better product mix. As our operations begin to return back to normal, we expect a gradual reversal of these benefits that we experienced in 2020. 
Lastly, due to the uncertain nature of the current pandemic, we will not host an Investor Day this year and instead look to host it in 2021 when business activity normalizes. With that said, in December, we plan on updating you with our revenue growth and margin targets. 
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the line to take your questions. Christy?"

I'll start, and Andy will chime in. Generally speaking, we definitely continue to enjoy some of the lower discretionary expenses, although some of these expenses did start to come back, but they're definitely not at the level of pre-pandemic. So assuming that we'll get back to pre-pandemic level, SG&A will continue to be higher from the prior quarter. And some of it was associated also with employee-related expenses. So if you think about the mid-30s level that we were there, we continue with our cost-saving initiatives that we started before the pandemic, and we are very successful in terms of realizing savings there.

And we're doing some background work to try and understand the size of the market opportunity. But we think the need for surveillance to detect early community outbreak is likely to be a longer-term need, and we're very well positioned to support this with our ddPCR products. 
Yes, there are other technologies that you can use, but looking for that needle in the haystack in an environment with a lot of inhibitors, as you might imagine, is a situation that ddPCR can really serve quite well. So we're pleased with the uptake we've taken so far, and we're really taking a harder look at what the longer-term opportunity is. 
Second question -- oh, so non-COVID. Like the clinical diagnostics market, we're seeing some gradual return to normal. We're not quite there yet. But sequentially, we see the improvement of revenue coming in from our core products. And this means people are back at the lab doing experiments, western blooding, things like that. So we're optimistic. I think like our own R&D teams, I think research labs around the world are figuring out the right algorithm to have people come back in the lab and stay safe and get some work done.
