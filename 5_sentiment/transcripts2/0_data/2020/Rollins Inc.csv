Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 13.8% to $506 million compared to $444.6 million for the same quarter in 2018. Net income was approximately $50.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share",846,"Thank you, Eddie. Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 13.8% to $506 million compared to $444.6 million for the same quarter in 2018. Net income was approximately $50.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share compared to $51 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues for the first -- full year increased 10.6% to $2,015,000,000 compared to $1.822 billion for 2018. We're all pleased that we broke the $2 billion milestone. 
Net income for the full year was $203.3 million with earnings per share of $0.62. This compared to net income of $231.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share last year. Net income this year was negatively impacted by $50 million one-time charge for closing down our pension plan and a casualty reserve increase. Eddie will address these charges further in a few minutes. 
We continued to experience good solid growth in all of our business lines for the quarter, with Residential up 16.5%; Commercial, excluding Fumigation, rose 9.8%; and Termite and Ancillary services grew 16.1%. 
During the fourth quarter, a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what's your exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of treating and protecting structures from termite infestation to damage. As background, Chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years. Among its numerous uses, Chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, Chlordane use was narrowed to only termite -- excuse me, only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of in the United States were canceled. Working and stopped treating for Chlordane a year before. It's noteworthy that prior to this action, our company negotiated an agreement between the VersaCal chemical company, the manufacturer, and the EPA for VersaCal to voluntarily stop manufacturing Chlordane and that it not be banned. They both agreed. This helped working in the industry to avoid a potential lawsuit stampede like the asbestos situation. 
In the mid-'90s, the state of the post-Chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals didn't work as well as Chlordane. However, the new termiticide had been so positively promoted by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA failed miserably. This failure happened within a very short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies customers' home with vengeance. Orkin, which at one-time led the industry with its lifetime repair guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations. In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new product targeting all the homes that have previously been treated with the ineffective termite product. Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occurred and provide our customers the protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than $100 million. Our lifetime guarantees were replaced 3 to 5 retreat guarantees depending on the area of country and the type of home construction. 
Our 1996 P&L result reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The increase in termite revenues, termite claims and retreatment expense negatively impacted our financial results. Incidentally, we're all proud to work for a company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand and reputation. 
1997, the following year, we set up $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur. While the short-term costs were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning point always caused us -- also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the utilization of flow meters to measure the volume of termiticide applied and the use of foam as a chemical carrying agent and difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school that service technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed. We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments. All of these actions still exist today. 
I could go on and all with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite reserve and other related costs tremendously. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business."

As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work as well as Chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied in dramatic fashion. By 1997, and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20 million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training and treatment protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry Icon Paul Hardy and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus on meeting all obligations to their customers. The company-wide quality assurance program Orkin put into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us get out in front of this accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent headlines as they were already a growing concern. In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both the financial and human capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run. 
In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions in termite damage claims. The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins' experienced historically low termite claim volumes, and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full year. This is the direct result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns around termite damage claims, and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our experience better. 
So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know, we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week long regional manager leadership meeting in Atlanta. We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience, et cetera. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learn lessons are the hardest and if after this last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized that our teams were ready and up to the challenge and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After mother nature deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention. Specifically, our Orkin employee retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all 3 service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experience management matters. I also hope that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry. 
For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were rising accident and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by $0.01; depreciation increase related to the final stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada; and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full year numbers, my focus today will be to share the nonoperational events that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to accidents and injuries. Lastly, I'll give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a great start. 
First, I'll go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million was an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income taxes was $72 million or 0.8% above 2018. Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.4% compared to 2018, and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3. 
Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5% compared to 2018. When looking at the full year 2019 numbers, keep in mind, that the almost $50 million pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of our Rollins' books. For the year, we're calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense and currency for our non-GAAP results. For the full year, revenue was $2,015,000,000, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7 million in 2018. 
Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018 numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018. 
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.1% to $311.1 million compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.8% to $229.9 million. And earnings per share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018. 
Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%. 
Our company-wide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially higher premium rates experienced within the industries caused our casualty reserve for accidents and injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01. As John shared with you earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have enhanced safety features, and when coupled with our enhanced training will result in better injury and accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins, and we will see the benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters. 
As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to the next step in our journey. First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system, or CRM, called BOSS, and in stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200 to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes. And as you probably know, we exceeded that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction which will equate to margin improvement of another 150 to 250 basis points over the next 2 to 3 years. This step is Phase 2 of a robust 4-phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come. 
Let's take a look-through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 16.5%; commercial pest control ex-fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 9.8%; and  termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial ex-fumigation increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%. 
There are 2 items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over 30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our onetime bed bug business and helped our residential product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years. 
In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related to our 401(k) match. Additionally, insurance and claims were up substantially, as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to 50.6% in 2019 compared to 50.2% in 2018. 
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several large acquisitions. 
Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey, as discussed earlier. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8 million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.1 percentage point from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend per Clark that was not in our 2018 number. 
Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an average of around $20 million over the past 5 years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we'll also see some residual improvements from our pension transition. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2019, we spent $430.6 million on acquisitions compared to $76.8 million the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We  ended the period with $94.3 million in cash, of which $74.1 million is held by foreign subsidiaries. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2020. The cash dividend is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%. 
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

But Kevin's budget for advertising has not changed over that time period as far as a percent of revenue. So he and his team have done a tremendous job, just figuring out how do we still create the number of leads that we need by the different service lines using the different opportunities that are out there. Some of that's going to be things like advertising on billboards, some of it is going to be commercial advertising, some of it is going to be through digital. But he uses that total bucket and goes through and figures out a way to be able to create that demand that we need in order to be able to grow our business.

During the fourth quarter, a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what's your exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of treating and protecting structures from termite infestation to damage. As background, chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years. Among its numerous uses, chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, chlordane use was narrowed to only termite -- excuse me, only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of chlordane in the United States were canceled. Orkin had stopped treating with chlordane a year before. It's noteworthy that prior to this action, our company negotiated an agreement between the Velsicol Chemical Company, the manufacturer, and EPA for Velsicol to voluntarily stop manufacturing chlordane and that it not be banned. They both agreed. This helped Orkin and the industry to avoid a potential lawsuit stampede like the asbestos situation.
By the mid-'90s, the state of the post-chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane. However, the new termiticide had been so positively promoted by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA, failed miserably. This failure happened within a very short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies customers' home with vengeance. Orkin, which at onetime led the industry with its lifetime repair guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations. In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new product targeting all the homes that have previously been treated with the ineffective termite product. Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occur and provide our customers the protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than $100 million. Our lifetime guarantees were replaced 3 to 5 retreatment guarantees depending on the area of country and the type of home construction.
Our 1996 P&L resulted -- reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The increase in termite revenues, termite claims and retreatment expense negatively impacted our financial results. Incidentally, we're all proud to work for a company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand and reputation.
1997, the following year, we set up a $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur. While the short-term costs were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning point always caused us -- also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the utilization of flowmeters to measure the volume of termiticide applied and the use of foam as a chemical carrying agent in difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school that service technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed. We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments. All of these actions still exist today.
I could go on and on with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite reserve and other related costs tremendously.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business."

As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied in dramatic fashion. By 1997, and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20 million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training and treatment protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry Icon Paul Hardy and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus on meeting all obligations to their customers. The company-wide quality assurance program Orkin put into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us to get out in front of this accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent headlines as they were already a growing concern. In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both the financial and human capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run.
In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions in termite damage claims. The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins experienced historically low termite claim volumes, and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full year. This is the direct result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns around termite damage claims, and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our experience better.
So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know, we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week long regional manager leadership meeting in Atlanta. We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience, et cetera. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learned lessons are the hardest and after this last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized that our teams were ready and up to the challenge and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After mother nature deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention. Specifically, our Orkin employee retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all 3 service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experience management matters. I also hope that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry.
For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were rising accident and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by $0.01; depreciation increase related to the final stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada; and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full year numbers, my focus today will be to share the nonoperational events that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to accidents and injuries. Lastly, I'll give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a great start.
First, I'll go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million was an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income taxes was $72 million or 0.8% above 2018. Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.4% compared to 2018, and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3.
Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5% compared to 2018. When looking at the full year 2019 numbers, keep in mind that the almost $50 million pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of our Rollins' books. For the year, we're calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense and currency for our non-GAAP results. For the full year, revenue was $2.015 billion, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7 million in 2018.
Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018 numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018.
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.1% to $311.1 million compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.8% to $229.9 million. And earnings per share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%.
Our company-wide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially higher premium rates experienced within the industries caused our casualty reserve for accidents and injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01. As John shared with you earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have enhanced safety features, and when coupled with our enhanced training will result in better injury and accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins, and we will see the benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters.
As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to the next step in our journey. First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system, or CRM, called BOSS, and in stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200 to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes. And as you probably know, we exceeded that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction which will equate to margin improvement of another 150 to 250 basis points over the next 2 to 3 years. This step is Phase 2 of a robust 4-phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 16.5%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 9.8%; and  termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial ex fumigation increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%.
There are 2 items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over 30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our onetime bed bug business and helped our residential product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, insurance and claims were up substantially, as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to 50.6% in 2019, compared to 50.2% in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several large acquisitions.
Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey, as discussed earlier.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8 million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.1 percentage point from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend per Clark that was not in our 2018 number.
Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an average of around $20 million over the past 5 years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we'll also see some residual improvements from our pension transition. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2019, we spent $430.6 million on acquisitions compared to $76.8 million the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We ended the period with $94.3 million in cash, of which $74.1 million is held by foreign subsidiaries.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2020. The cash dividend is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Revenues for the first -- full year increased 10.6% to $2.015 billion compared to $1.822 billion for 2018. We're all pleased that we broke the $2 billion milestone.
Net income for the full year was $203.3 million with earnings per share of $0.62. This compared to net income of $231.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share last year. Net income this year was negatively impacted by a $50 million onetime charge for closing down our pension plan and a casualty reserve increase. Eddie will address these charges further in a few minutes.
We continued to experience good solid growth in all of our business lines for the quarter, with residential up 16.5%; commercial, excluding fumigation, rose 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services grew 16.1%.
During the fourth quarter, a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what's your exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of treating and protecting structures from termite infestation to damage. 
As background, chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years. Among its numerous uses, chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, chlordane's use was narrowed to only termite -- excuse me, only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of chlordane in the United States were canceled. Orkin had stopped treating with chlordane a year before. It's noteworthy that prior to this action, our company negotiated an agreement between the Velsicol Chemical Company, the manufacturer, and the EPA for Velsicol to voluntarily stop manufacturing chlordane and that it not be banned. They both agreed. This helped Orkin and the industry to avoid a potential lawsuit stampede like the asbestos situation.
By the mid-'90s, the state of the post-chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane. However, the new termiticide that had been so positively promoted by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA, failed miserably. This failure happened within a very short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies customers' homes with vengeance. Orkin, which at one time led the industry with its lifetime repair guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations. 
In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new product targeting all the homes that had previously been treated with the ineffective termite product. Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occurred and provide our customers the protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than $100 million. Our lifetime guarantees were replaced to 3 to 5 retreatment guarantees depending on the area of country and the type of home construction.
Our 1996 P&L resulted -- reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The increase in termite revenues, termite claims and retreatment expense negatively impacted our financial results. Incidentally, we're all proud to work for a company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand and reputation.
1997, the following year, we set up a $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur. While the short-term costs were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning point always caused us -- also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the utilization of flowmeters to measure the volume of termiticide applied and the use of foam as a chemical carrying agent in difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school that service technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed. We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments. All of these actions still exist today.
I could go on and on with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite reserve and other related costs tremendously.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business."

In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Ov",589,"Thank you, Gary. As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied in dramatic fashion. By 1997, and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20 million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training and treatment protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry Icon Paul Hardy and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus on meeting all obligations to their customers. The company-wide quality assurance program Orkin put into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us to get out in front of this accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent headlines as they were already a growing concern. 
In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both the financial and human capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run.
In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions in termite damage claims. The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins experienced historically low termite claim volumes, and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full year. This is the direct result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns around termite damage claims, and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our experience better.
So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know, we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week long regional manager leadership meeting in Atlanta. We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience, et cetera. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learned lessons are the hardest and after this last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized that our teams were ready and up to the challenge and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After Mother Nature deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention. Specifically, our Orkin employee retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all 3 service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experience management matters. I also hope that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry.
For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were rising accident and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by $0.01; depreciation increase related to the final stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada; and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full year numbers, my focus today will be to share the nonoperational events that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to accidents and injuries. Lastly, I'll give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a great start.
First, I'll go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million was an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income taxes was $72 million or 0.8% above 2018. Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.4% compared to 2018, and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3.
Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5% compared to 2018. When looking at the full year 2019 numbers, keep in mind that the almost $50 million pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of our Rollins' books. For the year, we're calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense and currency for our non-GAAP results. For the full year, revenue was $2.015 billion, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7 million in 2018.
Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018 numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018.
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.1% to $311.1 million compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.8% to $229.9 million. And earnings per share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%.
Our company-wide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially higher premium rates experienced within the industries caused our casualty reserve for accidents and injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01. As John shared with you earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have enhanced safety features, and when coupled with our enhanced training will result in better injury and accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins, and we will see the benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters.
As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to the next step in our journey. 
First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system, or CRM, called BOSS, and in stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200 to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes. And as you probably know, we exceeded that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction which will equate to margin improvement of another 150 to 250 basis points over the next 2 to 3 years. This step is Phase 2 of a robust 4-phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 16.5%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial ex fumigation increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%.
There are 2 items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over 30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our onetime bed bug business and helped our residential product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, insurance and claims were up substantially, as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to 50.6% in 2019, compared to 50.2% in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several large acquisitions.
Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey, as discussed earlier.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8 million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.1 percentage point from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend per Clark that was not in our 2018 number.
Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an average of around $20 million over the past 5 years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we'll also see some residual improvements from our pension transition. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2019, we spent $430.6 million on acquisitions compared to $76.8 million the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We ended the period with $94.3 million in cash, of which $74.1 million is held by foreign subsidiaries.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2020. The cash dividend is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 13.8% to $506 million compared to $444.6 million for the same quarter in 2018.

Revenues for the first -- full year increased 10.6% to $2.015 billion compared to $1.822 billion for 2018. We're all pleased that we broke the $2 billion milestone.
Net income for the full year was $203.3 million with earnings per share of $0.62. This compared to net income of $231.7 million or $0.71 per diluted share last year. Net income this year was negatively impacted by a $50 million onetime charge for closing down our pension plan and a casualty reserve increase. Eddie will address these charges further in a few minutes.
We continued to experience good solid growth in all of our business lines for the quarter, with residential up 16.5%; commercial, excluding fumigation, rose 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services grew 16.1%.
During the fourth quarter, a question that we heard on a regular basis from investors was, what's your exposure to termite damage claims. I thought this might be a good time to provide some history and background on our termite claims and the service initiatives that were implemented over many years of treating and protecting structures from termite infestation to damage. 
As background, chlordane was used as a pesticide in the United States from 1948 to 1988, 40 years. Among its numerous uses, chlordane was a very effective termiticide to control against termite infestations in homes and other structures. In fact, from 1983 to 1988, chlordane's use was narrowed to only termite -- excuse me, only control termites. In 1988, all approved uses of chlordane in the United States were canceled. Orkin had stopped treating with chlordane a year before. It's noteworthy that prior to this action, our company negotiated an agreement between the Velsicol Chemical Company, the manufacturer, and the EPA for Velsicol to voluntarily stop manufacturing chlordane and that it not be banned. They both agreed. This helped Orkin and the industry to avoid a potential lawsuit stampede like the asbestos situation.
By the mid-'90s, the state of the post-chlordane termite world was daunting. The replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane. However, the new termiticide that had been so positively promoted by the manufacturers and endorsed by the EPA, failed miserably. This failure happened within a very short period of time. Termites returned to our customers' home as well as other pest control companies customers' homes with vengeance. Orkin, which at one time led the industry with its lifetime repair guarantees, was suddenly faced with a major business challenge. There were millions of dollars in repair costs now appearing due to termite damage along with corresponding retreatment obligations. 
In 1996, Orkin took a very important step and began a proactive retreatment program with a better new product targeting all the homes that had previously been treated with the ineffective termite product. Simply, we wanted to curtail the termite damage before it occurred and provide our customers the protection they deserve. We put our customers first at the cost of more than $100 million. Our lifetime guarantees were replaced to 3 to 5 retreatment guarantees depending on the area of country and the type of home construction.
Our 1996 P&L resulted -- reflected Orkin's retreatment efforts and Orkin's revenues increased 1%, while operating income and profit margins decreased 50%. The increase in termite revenues, termite claims and retreatment expense negatively impacted our financial results. Incidentally, we're all proud to work for a company that made this forward-looking investment to protect our customers, our brand and reputation.
1997, the following year, we set up a $117 million reserve fund to cover the escalating cost of termite claims. We knew we had to make these extra efforts and made the conscious decision to provide free retreatments and promptly pay for any termite damage repairs that occur. While the short-term costs were extremely painful, they appropriately protected our reputation and balance sheet. This turning point always caused us -- also caused us to make further enhancements in termite treating training, the utilization of flowmeters to measure the volume of termiticide applied and the use of foam as a chemical carrying agent in difficult-to-treat structures. We created a national termite swarm school that service technicians attended annually before each termite treating season. We created a termite quality audit and compliance team to visit our branches to ensure our treating specs and procedures were being followed. We also required our managers to do a quality inspection on all completed termite treatments. All of these actions still exist today.
I could go on and on with more than a dozen other initiatives that we took over the following years to ensure we provided the industry's best termite treatments. All of these actions have reduced our termite reserve and other related costs tremendously.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight on our termite war and other areas of business."

As Gary just noted, by the mid-'90s, it was clear the replacement chemicals didn't work as well as chlordane in the treatment of termites. In the 3 years prior to 1995, Orkin's termite damage claims averaged around $3 million per year. Over the next couple of years, the claims expense multiplied in dramatic fashion. By 1997, and for several years thereafter, termite damage claims exceeded $20 million a year. Decisions were made by our leadership team to improve process, training and treatment protocols. These new processes were then developed by our technical services group, led by industry Icon Paul Hardy and many other members of our team. This approach allowed our operations to focus on meeting all obligations to their customers. The company-wide quality assurance program Orkin put into place during that time concentrated solely on termite issues and helped us to get out in front of this accelerating termite issue. We also addressed the Formosan termite at that time, which has made recent headlines as they were already a growing concern. 
In other words, our quality assurance team as well as many other actions taken served over time to de-risk our termite service business. As a result of these many actions and activities, we have seen a steady decline in claims and retreatments from year-to-year. It is easy to put your finger on the many things mentioned that we changed. What is not so easy to put a finger on is the cultural change that had to occur with our field teams. It was painful, it was hard and it was costly from both the financial and human capital standpoint, and it also took a long time, but it was worth it in the long run.
In more recent years, as we have continued to work on this issue, we have experienced further reductions in termite damage claims. The average amount of each claim has fallen from the highest seen in the early to middle part of the 2000s. For 2019, Rollins experienced historically low termite claim volumes, and termite claims expenses were below 1% of termite revenues for the full year. This is the direct result of the many quality control programs leadership initiated. We certainly appreciate your concerns around termite damage claims, and we never take anything for granted. We take our responsibility to our termite customer seriously and hope that we have now given you enough information to understand our experience better.
So let's turn the page on that topic and talk about something else for a minute. As most of you know, we got off to a slow start last year. We are certainly prepared to do everything we can to not repeat that performance. Pursuant to that, in early January, we concluded a week long regional manager leadership meeting in Atlanta. We had over 100 of our leaders in from around the world for this event. This meeting focused on, among several priorities, improving our safety culture and practices, the customer experience, et cetera. But maybe most important of all, we were focused on lessons learned from a year ago and what not to do to repeat those mistakes. It is said that the best learned lessons are the hardest and after this last year, I believe that to be true. We came away from this meeting energized that our teams were ready and up to the challenge and pretty darn glad to put 2019 behind them.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back over to Eddie."

Before I begin my review of the financial numbers for the quarter, I want to recognize the solid results that our operations produced during the second half of the year. After Mother Nature deviated from her normal path in Q1 and Q2, the weather pattern turned more normal and the results of our operations produced record revenue growth in the quarter, strong double-digit EBITDA growth and continued improvements in both employee and customer retention. Specifically, our Orkin employee retention increased 1.8 percentage points and our commercial service line improved the most of all 3 service lines for retention year-over-year. Consistency and experience management matters. I also hope that the details that both Gary and John shared related to our termite service will put to rest any concerns that you have about the recent termite discussions in our industry.
For the quarter, we had strong revenue growth and items that impacted the quarter were rising accident and insurance expense that reduced the Q4 results by $0.01; depreciation increase related to the final stages of the BOSS rollout in Canada; and a very successful pilot of the next phase of routing and scheduling journey. In addition to reporting our Q4 and full year numbers, my focus today will be to share the nonoperational events that impacted our Q4 results, specifically casualty and insurance related to accidents and injuries. Lastly, I'll give you some insight on some items that have 2020 already off to a great start.
First, I'll go through the results. Looking at the numbers, the fourth quarter revenues of $506 million was an increase of 13.8% over the prior year's fourth quarter revenue of $444.6 million. Income before income taxes was $72 million or 0.8% above 2018. Net income was $50.8 million, down 0.4% compared to 2018, and impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter due to the pension adjustment in Q3.
Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 per diluted share and EBITDA was $97.1 million and rose 10.5% compared to 2018. When looking at the full year 2019 numbers, keep in mind that the almost $50 million pension adjustment that was made in Q3 to transition our pension off of our Rollins' books. For the year, we're calling out the pension adjustment, Clark acquisition expense and currency for our non-GAAP results. For the full year, revenue was $2.015 billion, an increase of 10.6% over the prior year's 12-month revenue of $1.822 billion. Income before income taxes decreased 16% to $261.2 million from $310.7 million in 2018.
Net income fell 12.2% to $203.3 million and earnings per share were $0.62, down 12.7% from 2018 numbers of $0.71. EBITDA was $349.2 million, down 7.5% compared to 2018.
Without the pension adjustment, our non-GAAP income before income tax was up 0.1% to $311.1 million compared to $310.7 million in 2018. Our net income was down 0.8% to $229.9 million. And earnings per share were $0.70 per diluted share, down from $0.71 per diluted share in 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA, including our Q3 pension loss, was $399.1 million, up 5.8%.
Our company-wide focus on personal safety since 2016 has created reductions in our casualty reserve in the last few years. However, the combination of additional Clark vehicles and properties and substantially higher premium rates experienced within the industries caused our casualty reserve for accidents and injuries to increase over 5% in 2019 and impacted the quarter by roughly $0.01. As John shared with you earlier, we reviewed these opportunities extensively at our recent annual leadership kickoff meeting and have good initiatives to reduce the frequency and severity of our automotive and workers' compensation claims. As we continue to refresh our automotive fleet, a growing percentage of our vehicles have enhanced safety features, and when coupled with our enhanced training will result in better injury and accident outcomes moving forward. Safety is becoming an ingrained value at Rollins, and we will see the benefits of this as we move forward in 2020. We will share more of this journey in future quarters.
As we discussed last quarter, our operational efficiency and customer experience continued to improve with ongoing updates to our routing and scheduling. I am pleased to share some details with regards to the next step in our journey. 
First, beginning back in 2015, we rolled out our branch operating system, or CRM, called BOSS, and in stages, improved our technicians' routing and scheduling. At the time, we stated that we would see a 200 to 300 basis points margin improvement with these changes. And as you probably know, we exceeded that amount over the next several years. We have successfully piloted our next phase of routing and scheduling, which will include the level customer loading of the pest control technicians jobs based on customer demand, but keeping in mind customer needs. On top of the over 4 million miles that we have reduced in the last few years, we will see accelerating mileage reduction which will equate to margin improvement of another 150 to 250 basis points over the next 2 to 3 years. This step is Phase 2 of a robust 4-phase routing and scheduling initiative that will drive improved efficiency for years to come.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the fourth quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.8% included 8.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.7% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 43% of our revenue, was up 16.5%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 9.8%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 19% of our revenue, was up 16.1%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.7%. From that, residential was up 6%, commercial ex fumigation increased 3.6% and termite and ancillary grew by 8.7%.
There are 2 items that I would like to note. First, the continued growth of our mosquito program at over 30% rate has more than offset the slowdown in our onetime bed bug business and helped our residential product with continued strong growth. And second, we experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 49.7% from 50.2% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced expense increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, insurance and claims were up substantially, as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved to 50.6% in 2019, compared to 50.2% in 2018.
Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $6 million to $22.6 million, an increase of 35.8%. Depreciation increased $2.7 million due to acquisitions and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $3.3 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several large acquisitions.
Our depreciation in Q1 of 2020 will be slightly higher as we finalize the BOSS rollout in Canada and move to the next phase of our routing and scheduling journey, as discussed earlier.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter increased $19 million or 14% to $154.8 million or 30.6% of revenues, up 0.1 percentage point from $135.8 million or 30.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in the percent of revenues is primarily due to insurance and claims and acquisitions, particularly advertising spend per Clark that was not in our 2018 number.
Before I review our cash position, I want to update the state of our current cash flow. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we have accelerated our free cash flow by over $40 million for the year, which compares to an average of around $20 million over the past 5 years. Not only do we see benefits to our cash flow related to the acquisition of Clark Pest Control, but we'll also see some residual improvements from our pension transition. As for our cash position for the period ended December 31, 2019, we spent $430.6 million on acquisitions compared to $76.8 million the same period last year. We paid $153.8 million on dividends and had $27.1 million of CapEx, which were both flat to 2018. We ended the period with $94.3 million in cash, of which $74.1 million is held by foreign subsidiaries.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.12 per share that will be paid on March 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, February 10, 2020. The cash dividend is a 14.3% increase over the prior year's quarterly dividend. This marks the 18th consecutive year the Board has increased our dividend by a minimum of 12%.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke.

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008 as the closest example that we've had. But from our perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multi-facet, found ourselves in uncharted waters.
Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately, further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019.
Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter. Residential, up 18.6%. Commercial pest control rose 8%. The termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted.
Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, as we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
Business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress a number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. It would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
Actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways, taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. This distinction and as the world's largest pest control company we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people, health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment. 
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically",581,"Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically taking care of their customers and each other during this time. Services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe in line with this new normal we are all facing.
Highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic. And our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free. 
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment.
The Orkin program trademark uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."

Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today. Before I b",1392,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today. 
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers. As Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue, as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations.
In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019. 
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's now look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%, commercial ex fumigation increased 2.1% and termite and ancillary grew 11%. 
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continue to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter, it was the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match. Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease as a percent of revenue and the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future.
There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future.
Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits were just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll, and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
There are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for PP&E for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. 
Cost for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters.
Cost of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned.
Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000.
We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency.
And finally, the launch of VitalClean, the early wins -- with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit System in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectants to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020. 
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

We have a feeling for the larger customers which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about this mom and pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that.

And I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here, and I said, ""Okay. How many folks went to a sitdown restaurant since they've opened back up?"" And no one raised their hand. So we just don't really know what the impact is going to be even as we're opening back up and what the impact is going to be longer term for these businesses to be able to stay in business."

But what do you think that business looks like longer term? I mean, just as people tend to have a very short memory, I mean, does this business accelerate in a year from now? Or do you think because people tend to be short-minded that maybe they did forget about the COVID situation and they say, ""Oh, I don't need the service anymore."" And then maybe doesn't gain as much traction or have as much relevance maybe a year or 2 for now? Would just love your take on that."

Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter: residential, up 18.6%; commercial pest control rose 8%; and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress the number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically",587,"Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically, taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing.
The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full- and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic. And our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free.
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademark as VitalClean uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service not -- for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."

Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.Before I be",1396,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers: as Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue; and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included: higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with the personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019.
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%; commercial, ex fumigation, increased 2.1%; and termite and ancillary grew 11%.
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match.
Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is the percent of revenue -- in the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future.  There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll, and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E (sic) [ PPE ] for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Costs of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean, with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020.
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

We have a feeling for the larger customers, which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about these mom-and-pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well.
But residential, we're definitely seeing, are the most positive. And we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point in time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like."

I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have our bowling alleys open. But we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here, and I said, ""Okay, how many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since they've opened back up?""

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke.

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008, is the closest example that we've had. But from our perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifacet, found ourselves in unchartered waters.
Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter: residential, up 18.6%; commercial pest control rose 8% and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw a record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over the last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high-pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress the number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically, taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with the disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing.
The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full- and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need, while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free.
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademark as VitalClean uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service not -- for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."

Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.Before I b",1396,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers: as Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue; and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included: higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with the personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019.
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%; commercial, ex fumigation, increased 2.1%; and termite and ancillary grew 11%.
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match.
Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is the percent of revenue -- in the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future.  There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E (sic) [ PPE ] for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Costs of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean, with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020.
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

We have, on the residential side, which we put in our press release, we're still seeing a good demand. On the commercial side, we know what customers have been impacted on the commercial side. We've suspended some customers or they suspended us because of not having a need. And the reason why I'm punting on the question is because we don't know -- of those ones that have suspended, we don't know which ones of those customers will be coming back. We have a feeling for the larger customers, which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about this mom-and-pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well.
But residential, we're definitely seeing, are the most positive. And we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point in time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like."

I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have our bowling alleys open. But we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here, and I said, ""Okay, how many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since they've opened back up?""

One is they're doing normal -- their normal service that they would have, either because they're fully in business or they're in some sort of partial business. I think we have another bucket that have completely stopped at this point in time because they don't have anything at all going on. And I think we have a third bucket, which is kind of a hybrid, which -- let's just say they may be received a service once a week. They might now be receiving a service every other week or every 3 weeks, just to keep things relatively intact at this point. So we've got -- by customer, we're trying to accommodate as best as makes sense for them, especially for those that know they're going to be opening up relatively soon. They don't want to make a decision that they're going to open up on, let's just say, May 1. They haven't done anything for 4 weeks, and now they have an infestation that they have to go through and deal with. They don't want to have that situation. So I think those are kind of the buckets of what we're seeing by the customers."

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke.

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008, is the closest example that we've had. But from our perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifacet, found ourselves in unchartered waters.
Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter: residential, up 18.6%; commercial pest control rose 8% and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw a record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over the last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high-pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress the number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically, taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with the disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing.
The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full- and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need, while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free.
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademark as VitalClean uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service not -- for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."

Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.Before I b",1396,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers: as Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue; and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included: higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with the personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019.
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%; commercial, ex fumigation, increased 2.1%; and termite and ancillary grew 11%.
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match.
Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is the percent of revenue -- in the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E (sic) [ PPE ] for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Costs of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean, with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020.
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that.

And no one raised their hand. So we just don't really know what the impact is going to be even as we're opening back up and what the impact is going to be longer term for these businesses to be able to stay in business."

But what do you think that business looks like longer term? I mean just as people tend to have a very short memory, I mean, does this business accelerate in a year from now? Or do you think because people tend to be short-minded that maybe they did forget about the COVID situation and they say, ""Oh, I don't need this service anymore."" And then maybe doesn't gain as much traction or have as much relevance maybe a year or 2 from now? Would just love your take on that."

Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008, is the closest example that we've had. But from our perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifacet, found ourselves in unchartered waters.
Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter: residential, up 18.6%; commercial pest control rose 8% and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw a record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over the last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high-pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress the number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically",588,"Thank you. As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically, taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with the disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing.
The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full- and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need, while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free.
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademark as VitalClean uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service not -- for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,661981566,1972303,"Rollins, Inc., Q1 2020 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2020",2020-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.Before I b",1396,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers: as Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue; and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included: higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with the personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019.
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%; commercial, ex fumigation, increased 2.1%; and termite and ancillary grew 11%.
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match.
Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is the percent of revenue -- in the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E (sic) [ PPE ] for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Costs of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean, with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020.
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

We have a feeling for the larger customers, which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about this mom-and-pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well.
But residential, we're definitely seeing, are the most positive. And we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point in time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like."

I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have our bowling alleys open. But we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here, and I said, ""Okay. How many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since they've opened back up?""

We find ourselves in a place that none of us could have ever imagined when we last spoke. Needless to say, in our over 50 years as a public company, we have never encountered anything close to this pandemic. Many refer to the economic crisis of 2008, is the closest example that we've had. But from our perspective, this virus is a totally different animal. Its impact is multifacet, found ourselves in unchartered waters.
Prior to the last 2 weeks of March, our pest control service and sales were very positive and on track. However, as the virus began to expand, we started to see a reduction in the demand for our services. Initially, California shut down early, and we saw our business affected immediately. Further impacted by the hardest-hit state, New York, and other states shut down randomly until the end of the quarter. As you would expect, we were not able to cut our expenses enough during those final 2 weeks to adjust for the revenue drop.
Revenues for the first quarter, though, grew 13.7% to $487.9 million compared to $429.1 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income was approximately $43.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $44.2 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter last year.
On the positive side, we experienced growth in all of our business lines in the quarter: residential, up 18.6%; commercial pest control rose 8% and termite and ancillary services grew 17.4%.
A couple of other bright spots during the quarter. Mosquito sales and service began as the weather warmed. As a result, we saw a record-setting growth in that business line.
We also saw a strong revenue increase in our wildlife business, which increased double digits over the last year. Eddie will provide greater detail on this as well as other financial results shortly.
We're entering what is traditionally the high-pest season. All of our domestic and global facilities remain operational. However, commercial account retention and commercial sales results have been negatively impacted. Residential pest control demand remains positive. And with termite, it's too early to judge the season.
Overall, commercial pest control has been the most negatively impacted by the virus. Commercial crosses multiple verticals, including health care, food processing, logistics, grocery, retail, hospitality and others. Each of these industries is being impacted differently due to COVID-19. The hospitality retail restaurant business has been the most adversely affected, whereas we continue to see improved demand in health care, food processing, logistics and grocery.
The business is facing an all-time concern about the transmission of germs. We are pleased to announce last month that Orkin began offering a new disinfectant service called Orkin VitalClean. This new service will help business quickly and thoroughly suppress the number of serious pathogens that can endanger their employees and customers. Our VitalClean service has the potential to positively contribute to revenue and profit this year. John will provide more details on this new service.
The company has implemented numerous proactive and defensive actions to address the current business challenges and the impact of the pandemic. And while there are uncertainties regarding the duration and total effect of COVID-19, we anticipate our business will generally mirror the economy. This would be across the nation as regions, states, counties and cities begin to open up.
The actions that we have implemented take into consideration both the short-term impact and longer-term effects to follow. As the pandemic situation evolves, we will continue to evaluate our actions, their impact and adjust the business accordingly.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge our employees and their importance. Our people are our greatest asset, and we couldn't be prouder of them as they have quickly adjusted to the pandemic. We're experiencing an unprecedented time in our history, and our people are rising to the occasion in extraordinary ways. We're taking our responsibility seriously as we've been deemed an essential service provider by the Department of Homeland Security. With this distinction and as the world's largest pest control company, we have an extremely important role during this critical time. Protecting people health and property and the properties' well-being is an important assignment.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more details."

As Gary noted, we are certainly in very challenging times, and we are quickly responding to the impact that COVID-19 is having on our businesses, employees and customers.
Our people on the front lines of this pandemic have performed heroically, taking care of their customers and each other during this time. The services we provide are considered essential, so we are continuing to service our residential and commercial customers where possible. This holds true for our global operations as well, and we are continuing to do business in accordance with each country's guidelines.
Our focus over the past weeks has been on ensuring that our employees around the globe are safe and that we are providing them with the protection they need to service their customers responsibly.
Rollins has purchased and provided our technicians and other employees that interact with customers with the disposable personal protective equipment, including masks, gloves, shoe covers and protective outerwear. This is an ongoing investment that we believe we will continue to make in order to keep our employees and customers safe, in line with this new normal we are all facing.
The highest priority during this difficult time is and always will be the safety and security of our team, especially on the front line. To help ensure this, we have provided a company-wide increase to our paid time off program for all full- and part-time employees. Full-time employees will receive up to 80 hours of PTO for emergency leave during this coronavirus pandemic, and our part-time team will receive 40 hours, if they should need it. Our people can use this time for their own personal care or for a member of their immediate family who has tested positive or is being quarantined for a suspected case of the virus. We believe these measures will provide our team with the help and support they need, while protecting their health and the safety of those around them.
Given current business conditions, we have temporarily furloughed a number of employees in both field operations and our home offices. The furloughs will allow us to rehire these employees as demand improves. And in the meantime, we are providing full employee benefits for those affected.
Additionally, Rollins has suspended merit increases for the corporate staff, along with management salary reductions in both field and home office positions. Frontline team members have not been impacted by these salary reductions. Eddie will provide greater detail on this and other cost-cutting measures we have taken.
As Gary noted, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a new disinfection service that will quickly and thoroughly eliminate a wide variety of serious pathogens. Large-scale disinfection is imperative to keeping establishments where people shop, eat and work as sterile as possible and disease-free.
Orkin's VitalClean is an effective option for reducing risk and helping restore a safer and healthier business environment. The Orkin program trademark as VitalClean uses an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled for use against a wide variety of pathogens and is included on the EPA's list of approved products or List N that meet their criteria for use against SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
When applied in accordance with the product label by trained service professionals, this powerful disinfectant will kill 100% of bacteria and viruses on hard, nonporous surfaces and will sanitize soft porous services. We are very excited about the potential for this service not -- for both our existing and potential customers.
And now I'll turn the call over to Eddie."

Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.Before I b",1396,"Thank you, John. Our press release on April 20 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business. Today, we will report on our Q1 actual results and add some insight to what we know today.
Before I begin, I would also like to thank our over 15,000 employees that have adapted to a new way to work and support our customers as well as those that have helped and supported our impacted employees as well as our communities. We want to thank them for their efforts. We will truly be getting through this together.
As I go through the results of Q1, there are some items that were already being felt in our numbers: as Gary mentioned, the slowing of our commercial pest control revenue; and as John highlighted, an increased expense related to protective personal equipment, or PPE, for all customer-facing employees. While we patiently stood in line for PPE behind those first responder groups who have the most critical need to ensure they receive first, we began accumulating masks and other items to ensure the safety of our employees.
For the quarter, all of our service lines showed growth, and key to the quarter included: higher material costs and supplies, as mentioned, with the personal protective equipment; the launch of our new commercial disinfectant service, Orkin VitalClean; and our initial round of cost containment in our field operations and home office locations. In addition to reporting our Q1 numbers, my focus today will be to share what we know at this time related to Q2.
Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenue of $487.9 million was an increase of 13.7% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $429.1 million. Income before income taxes was $55.4 million or 1.2% below 2019. Net income was $43.3 million, down 2.2% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.13 per diluted share. EBITDA was $79.2 million and rose 9.2% compared to 2019.
Our Q2 numbers will begin to normalize as we lap Clark in May of this year. The impact of the initial Clark acquisition to our net income for the quarter includes: depreciation of $1.4 million, mostly due to buildings and added vehicles; amortization of intangibles of $3.1 million; and interest expense of $2.4 million.
As was mentioned earlier, we began aggressively purchasing PPE in Q1 along with the equipment and supplies needed for our new disinfectant service VitalClean. These 2 items, along with the transition to new, more diversified pest product suppliers, impacted our materials and supply costs for Q1 and will impact the business for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look to the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. Our total revenue increase of 13.7% included 8.6% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 5.1% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 42% of our revenue, was up 18.6%. Commercial pest control, which made up 38% of our revenue, was up 8%. And termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 17.4%. Also of note, as Gary mentioned, our wildlife services were up strong double digits.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 5.1%, even with the slowdown during March. From that, residential was up 6.1%; commercial, ex fumigation, increased 2.1%; and termite and ancillary grew 11%.
There are 2 items that I'd like to note. As Gary mentioned, the continued growth of our mosquito service at record levels continues to drive our residential revenue. And also, this quarter eclipsed the last quarter with double-digit increases as we also experienced the fastest termite and ancillary growth in the past 6 years.
In total, gross margin reduced to 48.5% from 49.4% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter experienced increases in several categories, mostly driven by Clark in the categories of service salaries, administrative salaries and personnel-related for our 401(k) match.
Additionally, materials and supplies were up as discussed earlier. Removing the impact of Clark, gross margin improved 49.3% in 2020.
Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter increased $4.9 million to $21.6 million, an increase of 29.5%. Depreciation increased $2 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, as mentioned earlier, while amortization of intangible assets increased $2.9 million due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $18.3 million or 13.1% to $157.9 million or 32.4% of revenues, down 0.1 percentage point from $139.5 million or 32.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2019. The decrease is the percent of revenue -- in the percent of revenue is primarily due to administrative salaries, sales salaries and personnel-related all growing at a slower rate than our revenue growth, offset by higher insurance and claims and maintenance and repairs due to scheduled IT projects.
Our cash flow continues to remain strong at this time. Our conservative move in reducing our dividend will further improve our balance sheet and will add flexibility as needed for the future. There are currently more unknowns than knowns around the economic impact of the virus. And this step, along with the others that we have taken, will further prepare us to come out of this time in even stronger financial shape for the future. Finally, related to cash, as our top priority, we have continued with our M&A activity around the globe with completed acquisitions in March and plans for more in the second quarter.
As for our cash position for the period ended March 31, 2020, we spent $47.6 million on acquisitions compared to $7 million the same period last year. We paid $39.3 million on dividends and had $6.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2019. We ended the period with $92.6 million in cash, of which $64.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I wrap up, I want to share the pandemic-related impacts that we are aware of that will be ongoing. As most of you know, our payroll and benefits are just over 50% of our costs and are extremely variable based on our revenue levels. The 2 other major cost categories are fleet at about 7.5%, which is slightly less variable than payroll and materials and supplies, which is also about 7.5% and variable based on revenue.
Here are a few items and approximate impacts to consider for the second quarter. First, the cost items for the quarter. We'll have additional materials and supply expense, which will be between $2 million and $3 million for the PP&E (sic) [ PPE ] for our customer-facing employees, and this will be ongoing for the foreseeable future. Costs for the benefits for furloughed employees will be between $300,000 and $500,000, and we will update as we know more in future quarters. Costs of additional paid sick and leave time related to COVID-19 will be between $350,000 and $600,000, and we would anticipate that amount reducing in future quarters.
Offsetting these higher costs for Q2, we have cost containment or reductions implemented in April, which will impact Q2 between $18 million and $22 million. These include discretionary cuts and payroll, some of which John mentioned. Capital expenditure cuts to only essential products to run our business. This will reduce our historical percent of revenue by about 0.1 percentage point or $700,000. We're moving into our mosquito and termite seasons, as Gary mentioned, which will help improve our route density and improve efficiency. And finally, the launch of VitalClean, with early wins around the globe in industries such as food, housing, hospitality, fitness and transit. As a specific example, we just signed the British Columbia Transit system in Canada.
As shelter-in-place rules change in the coming months, we anticipate demand for our pet services and new disinfectant to rise, and we are well positioned to adapt as those changes occur. Until that time, we will continue to study and adjust our cost structure as needed.
Finally, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction to our cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business, May 11, 2020.
Gary, I will now turn the call back over to you."

We have, on the residential side, which we put in our press release, we're still seeing a good demand. On the commercial side, we know what customers have been impacted on the commercial side. We've suspended some customers or they suspended us because of not having a need. And the reason why I'm punting on the question is because we don't know -- of those ones that have suspended, we don't know which ones of those customers will be coming back. We have a feeling for the larger customers, which ones will be coming back, but we just don't know about this mom-and-pops. They may or may not be coming back based on their personal economic situations. So it's really too soon for us to be able to give any sort of prediction on that. And as Gary talked about on the termite side, that's hanging in there as well.
But residential, we're definitely seeing, are the most positive. And we can give more color as we see things shaping up as we move forward. But I think at this point in time, we're still not sure what that commercial is going to look like."

I know it's anecdotal. And if you need to go bowling, you can come here to Georgia because we have our bowling alleys open. But we also have restaurants that are opened up. I know it's anecdotal, but we took a little poll this morning of my folks here, and I said, ""Okay. How many folks went to a sit-down restaurant since they've opened back up?""

One is they're doing normal -- their normal service that they would have, either because they're fully in business or they're in some sort of partial business. I think we have another bucket that have completely stopped at this point in time because they don't have anything at all going on. And I think we have a third bucket, which is kind of a hybrid, which -- let's just say they may be received a service once a week. They might now be receiving a service every other week or every 3 weeks, just to keep things relatively intact at this point. So we've got -- by customer, we're trying to accommodate as best as makes sense for them, especially for those that know they're going to be opening up relatively soon. They don't want to make a decision that they're going to open up on, let's just say, May 1. They haven't done anything for 4 weeks, and now they have an infestation that they have to go through and deal with. They don't want to have that situation. So I think those are kind of the buckets of what we're seeing by the customers."

Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. The net income rose approximately [indiscernible] to $74.9 million or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1 billion -- an increase of $9.3 million compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.1 million or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase. 
Turning to our business lines. Results in the quarter, residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers. During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them and what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist, they're coming into our brand offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely. Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted test. Additionally, as family self quarantine, many who are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates. Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns it go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap this month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having an infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out our related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?"

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and cost health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do. 
As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment of sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service to hundreds of first responder locations, police stations, firehouses and hospitals. As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back the patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity. 
Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced. 
Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally. Having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adam's Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins national coverage in Australia. Adam's Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944 and has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas. In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany environmental services based in Central London and Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these verifying companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses. I will now turn the call over to Eddie."

Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our non-field operations group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth. And keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt. 
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter. The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019. As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions, and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our Wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter. Again, total revenue acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8% and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales record which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights. 
In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier.  Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark. Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror a general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic. Our cash flow continues to be strong. At this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond. Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020.

And I think as you saw pockets begin to open up and you began to see commerce and hiring begin and some of the stimulus checks, get into people's hands, I think that will make different decisions on things. And I think you've kind of seen the ebb and flow, of course, of that as some things are starting to kind of tighten up again. But I think incrementally, as things got a little bit better, we'll do better. We saw that on the commercial side as well. Do you want to say anything else on that?"

Because they've had an experience typically of large infestations and that's one of the things. They cannot do without pest control in definitely. And they've got health department attention naturally. And so we really think that -- we see them coming back, but we think they'll continue to come back."

One, if this event had to occur, if the virus had to occur, the pandemic had to occur, from a business standpoint, it was the best possible time for us as an organization. We had not hired for our peak season. We were just starting into that at that point in time. So it enabled us to really be able to go through and quickly align the payroll side as best we could. And then John and team as well as here in our home office, we made some difficult decisions and made some cuts to be able to go through and and be prepared. So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint. And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas, flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss is saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we are -- that appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that will be -- that we'll have a clear focus on.

And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintain them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play."

So restaurants since they being takeout and delivery now having set -- inside seating. Those are the types of places where we've seen much more of a need. And as the economy continues to move in that direction, I think we'll see good opportunities. But it's been a great cross-sell for us. John and team, again, hats off, we're able to get the product launched, get the salespeople trained, to get technicians fully trained and for our procurement group to get the product into the hands of our folks in a very short period of time has been very positive.

If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than 1 product -- if they take more than 1 service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need from services from the newest homeowners, the that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homers that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of typically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that.

Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 16.5% (sic) [ 17.2% ] to $74.9 million (sic) [ $75.4 million ] or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.1 million (sic) [ $118.6 million ] or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase.
Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers.

They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely.
Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward.
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?"

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do.
As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals.
As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity.
Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced.
Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas.
In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses.
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,674436679,2049627,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2020",2020-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today",1172,"Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future.
For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt.
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter.
The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019.
As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights.
In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic.
Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Tim, we've seen sort of an evolution with TruGreen as their noncompete with Terminix has sort of expired, go from lawn to offering tick-and-flea services to mosquito to now what their offering is, is essentially outdoor residential pest control, outdoor only. And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services.

So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint.
And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that.

And that's really where we're seeing the impact at this point. Residential, we're not seeing an impact at this time, having to do with the concern with that. But we're staying close to those large customers to try to help mitigate whatever we can and also work with our long-term customers that we've had relationships with. We want to help them to survive this as best we can, and we're going to work with them as appropriate. But then we'll take the needed steps from there."

If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there."

Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 16.5% (sic) [ 17.2% ] to $74.9 million (sic) [ $75.4 million ] or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.1 million (sic) [ $118.6 million ] or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase.
Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers.
During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely.
Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward.
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?"

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do.
As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals.
As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity.
Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced.
Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas.
In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses.
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,674436679,2089475,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2020",2020-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today",1172,"Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future.
For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt.
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter.
The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019.
As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights.
In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic.
Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So here it goes. A major lawn care provider recently announced that they're getting into the residential exterior pest services.

Do you view this as a competitive threat? Are you not concerned? Any thoughts you have on this issue would be greatly appreciated."

And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services.

One, if this event had to occur -- if the virus had to occur, the pandemic had to occur, from a business standpoint, it was the best possible time for us as an organization. We had not hired for our peak season. We were just starting into that at that point in time. So it enabled us to really be able to go through and quickly align the payroll side as best we could. And then John and team as well as here in our home office, we made some difficult decisions and made some cuts to be able to go through and be prepared. So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint.
And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we're appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that we'll be -- that we'll have a clear focus on.

And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintained them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play."

So we're dealing with that. We're staying close to those customers. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have set aside a reserve for what we feel is appropriate based predominantly on our commercial customers.

If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that.

Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 16.5% (sic) [ 17.2% ] to $74.9 million (sic) [ $75.4 million ] or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.1 million (sic) [ $118.6 million ] or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase.
Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers.
During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely.
Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward.
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?"

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do.
As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals.
As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity.
Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced.
Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas.
In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses.
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,674436679,2089476,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2020",2020-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today",1172,"Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future.
For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt.
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter.
The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019.
As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights.
In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic.
Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

One, if this event had to occur -- if the virus had to occur, the pandemic had to occur, from a business standpoint, it was the best possible time for us as an organization. We had not hired for our peak season. We were just starting into that at that point in time. So it enabled us to really be able to go through and quickly align the payroll side as best we could. And then John and team as well as here in our home office, we made some difficult decisions and made some cuts to be able to go through and be prepared. So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint.
And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time. So staying very close to that to make sure that we're appropriately managing on the cost side will be something that we'll be -- that we'll have a clear focus on. And John and team across all the brands have done that. And of course, the commercial operations have been the most impacted, our brands that are predominantly commercial.

So our people were able to laser in on the commercial side of that business and then -- and react very, very quickly. And then further to that, as we furlough those people, we maintained them on benefits. And as various circumstances happened, we were able to recall them and put them back to work and make them productive right away. So our teams in the field did a terrific job reacting. And as Eddie said, we hadn't really shifted into high gear quite yet on our hiring for the season. So those factors were at play."

One, if customers have some sort of incident at their locations, they're typically much more open to quickly move forward and get that in place. And then as other places are fully ramping up, so restaurants instead of being takeout and delivery now having seat -- inside seating. Those are the types of places where we've seen much more of a need. And as the economy continues to move in that direction, I think we'll see good opportunities. But it's been a great cross-sell for us. John and team, again, hats off. We're able to get the product launched, to get the salespeople trained, to get technicians fully trained and for our procurement group to get the product into the hands of our folks in a very short period of time has been very positive. So it's another trust point for our customers that we allow them to be able to run their business by us supporting them and it just takes one more worry off of their plate, having to deal with this whole situation."

So we're dealing with that. We're staying close to those customers. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we have set aside a reserve for what we feel is appropriate based predominantly on our commercial customers. And that's really where we're seeing the impact at this point. Residential, we're not seeing an impact at this time, having to do with the concern with that.

If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there."

Now back to our second quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 5.6% to $553.3 million compared to $524 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose approximately 16.5% (sic) [ 17.2% ] to $74.9 million (sic) [ $75.4 million ] or $0.23 per diluted shares compared to $64 million or $0.20 per diluted shares for the second quarter of last year. Revenues for the first 6 months of the year were $1.04 billion, an increase of 9.3% compared to $953 million for the same period last year. Net income for the first 6 months increased 8.9% to $118.1 million (sic) [ $118.6 million ] or $0.36 per diluted share compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the comparable period last year, a 9% increase.
Turning to our business lines results in the quarter. Residential pest control grew an outstanding 14.8%. Commercial, however, excluding fumigation, was down 5.2%. We have offset some of those commercial revenue shortfalls with termite and ancillary service, which was up 7.3%. Eddie will provide greater detail around these numbers.
During what we consider the most challenging time in our company's history, our employees' efforts and contributions have been exceptional in every regard. We couldn't be more grateful and proud of them in what they've done. They truly are our most valuable asset. We continue to be aware and involved to ensure their safety and good health. They are provided with personal protection as needed as they go about servicing our customers. Most of our technicians are working remotely, and avoiding spacing issues that would exist their coming into our branch offices. The majority of our home office and call center employees are also working remotely.
Our commitment to safe practices involves our valued customers as well. On the plus side, most of our residential customers have been at home 24/7, and they are becoming even more conscious of their home, and in some cases, the need to protect their family and property from unwanted pests. Additionally, as families self-quarantine, many are spending more time in their yards, recognizing the need for mosquito control. We are benefiting from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in our brands, which is, in part, responsible for our fast-growing pest control revenue and our gain in new customers, all at record-setting rates.
Before turning the call over to John, I want to note, while we were pleased with our results for the quarter, we continue to face the challenges of the pandemic and the unknowns that go with it. As a result, we review and adjust our activities and policies routinely to help us better address the impact of COVID-19. As I mentioned, commercial pest control unfortunately has been more impacted by the virus and its related economic circumstances. However, we've been narrowing the revenue shortfall gap each month since March. Anecdotally, we are seeing a growing realization at many businesses that they can't shut down pest control services for an extended period of time without having infestation consequences. A worthwhile offset to these commercial pest control challenges has been our other brands and introduction of our disinfectant service, VitalClean. As a result of this new service development prior to the pandemic, we had the ability to roll out related sales and service protocols quickly. VitalClean is gaining traction, and we would expect it to be more significant contributor to our commercial revenue going forward.
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on these aspects of our business. John?"

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members.

I would like to echo the commentary Gary made earlier about our team members. A common theme worldwide was their unbelievable response to this pandemic and their commitment to their customers throughout this event. As the pandemic started, we saw firsthand, the trust that our customers have in our highly reputable brands and service professionals. Additionally, we quickly moved to outfit our field teams with personal protective gear that help keep them safe, as well as give our customers confidence in our ability to service their pest needs responsibly. Without the response we received from our outstanding team members, our customers would have been left unprotected from many insect and rodent caused health threats. Thank you all very much for what you do.
As we noted last quarter, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a disinfection service, which quickly and thoroughly eliminates a wide variety of serious pathogens. Comprehensive disinfection is imperative to keeping an establishment as sterile as possible and disease free. During the second quarter, we were very delighted to see the positive reception this service is receiving from our commercial customers. I was especially pleased at a wide-ranging movement from our field teams to provide this service [indiscernible] to hundreds of first-responder locations: police stations, firehouses and hospitals.
As the economy slowly opens and our -- and more commercial businesses begin welcoming back their patrons for indoor dining, shopping or as guests in their hotels, and as their employees go back to the various workplaces, we expect the demand for VitalClean services to continue to grow. We are pleased with the progress thus far and very excited about the potential for this opportunity.
Our call centers were very busy during the second quarter as reflected in our increased residential sales. The record book for performance was completely rewritten as our inbound telephone sales effort replaced 7 of the top 10 sales days in our history. From what we are currently experiencing, we are optimistic that these results will continue into the third quarter as July performance certainly reflects that as the remaining 3 top 10 sales days have been replaced.
Last, we continue to expand our company's presence both in the U.S. and globally, having made second quarter acquisitions in Australia and the U.K. On July 1, we announced one of our Australian subsidiaries had acquired the largest independent pest control company in Australia, Adams Pest Control. This acquisition solidifies Rollins' national coverage in Australia. Adams Pest, founded by John Adams and established in 1944, has expertise in all aspects of general pest and wildlife control and is the market leader in the Greater Melbourne and Adelaide areas.
In the United Kingdom, we also acquired 2 environmentally friendly companies. Albany Environmental Services based in Central London and Van Vynck Environmental Services in Essex. These latest acquisitions bring our presence to 7 companies covering all the U.K. We are very pleased to welcome these very fine companies and their teams to the Rollins portfolio of best businesses.
I will now turn the call over to Eddie."
300753,674436679,2089477,"Rollins, Inc., Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2020",2020-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Rollins, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today",1172,"Thank you, John. Our press release on July 7 gave you some insight as to what we knew at that time related to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Today, I'll share some details on our Q2 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. During the entirety of the second quarter, our operations have remarkably navigated all that we, as a society, have dealt with related to the economic and health impacts of the virus. Additionally, our nonfield operation group successfully switched to a remote work model and did not miss a beat with their support. As you can see from the outcome, their collective results and efforts have been outstanding. From a reporting perspective, please also keep in mind that we lapped our initial Clark acquisition on May 1, and we will see much more normalized financial results for the quarter and the foreseeable future.
For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite services lines showed growth, and keys to the quarter included higher materials and supplies costs, which included the purchase of personal protective equipment, successful cost containment implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year and provision set up for potential of commercial customer bad debt.
Looking at the numbers, the second quarter revenue of $553.3 million was an increase of 5.6% over the prior year's second quarter revenue of $524 million. Income before income taxes was $103.5 million or 19% above 2019. Net income was $75.4 million, up 17.2% compared to last year. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.23 per diluted share. EBITDA was $126.9 million and rose 16.4% compared to 2019. Our Q2 numbers have begun to normalize again as we lapped the initial Clark acquisition in the quarter.
The first 6 months revenue of $1.041 billion was an increase of 9.3% over the prior year's first 6 months revenue of $953 million. Income before income taxes was $158.9 million or 11.1% above last year. Net income was $118.6 million, up 9.3% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 per diluted share. EBITDA was $206.1 million and rose 13.6% compared to 2019.
As we stated on our Q1 call, we began aggressively purchasing PP&E in March and in April. This, along with the transition to new, more diversified vendors impacted our materials and supplies costs between $2 million and $3 million in Q2 and will impact the business in a similar manner for the remainder of the year.
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the second quarter. As Gary reviewed, our total revenue increase of 5.6% included 3.1% from Clark and other acquisitions and the remaining 2.5% was from pricing and organic growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 14.8%; commercial pest control ex fumigation, which made up 33% of our revenue, was down 5.2%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, was up 7.3%. Also of note, our wildlife services were up strong double digits yet again this quarter.
Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 2.5%. And from that, residential was up 10.3%, commercial ex fumigation decreased 7.8%, and termite and ancillary grew by 5.5%. As John mentioned in his remarks, but I also want to recognize our call centers that made the transition to working remotely and then went on to set numerous revenue and sales records which helped drive our residential growth. Both Gary and John discussed the trust of our customers during the quarter. Our investment in PP&E also helped our customers to show trust in our well-known brands. Seeing their technicians or salesperson in full PP&E gave a comfort that we also had the customer safety top of mind. Our feedback from customers shared on our NPS score for our residential product showed 2.4 percentage points higher than last year, which included a new COVID-19 category. This data was further supported by significantly better Google reviews and Facebook recommendations. Marketing has supported our ops very well to gain these insights.
In total, gross margin increased to 53.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by our lower salary expense in the areas of company furloughs, layoffs and salary reductions as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling initiatives. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as discussed earlier. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $1.8 million to $21.9 million, an increase of 8.9%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets increased $754,000 due to the amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including Clark.
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter increased $9.4 million or 5.8% to $171.3 million or 30.9% of revenues, which was flat to last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel, discretionary savings, but was offset with a higher reserve set for our anticipated bad debt, primarily from our commercial customers due to COVID-19. Our commercial business is a mirror to the general economy around the world. While many of our commercial pest control customers are paying at a slower rate than normal, they are still paying. Based on what we know at this time, we feel that we have adequately reserved for those customers that may not be in business on the other side of the pandemic.
Our cash flow continues to be strong, and at this time, we have no changes to our capital allocation plans. As our top priority, we've continued with our M&A activity around the globe. As John mentioned, we completed several acquisitions in the quarter and have plans for more in the future. During the quarter, we more aggressively paid down our debt and are now on track to have this retired in late 2021. As for our cash position for the period ended June 30, 2020, we spent $56 million on acquisitions compared to $410.1 million in the same period last year, which included Clark. We paid $65.5 million on dividends and had $12.4 million of CapEx, which were slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $134.8 million in cash, of which $73.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.
Before I close, I want to share that we have released our first-ever sustainability report for 2019. We've taken the opportunity to highlight some of the things that we have going on in the areas of the environment, social and governance. The report has been posted on our website, and we look forward to building on these areas as a company as we move through 2020 and beyond.
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a temporary reduction of the regular cash dividend to $0.08 per share that will be paid on September 10, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 10, 2020.
Gary, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Tim, we've seen sort of an evolution with TruGreen as their noncompete with Terminix has sort of expired, go from lawn to offering tick-and-flea services to mosquito to now what their offering is, is essentially outdoor residential pest control, outdoor only. And so the relationship with the technician and the customer is a struggle. And cross-selling those customers is a real struggle. I think if that were easy to do, ServiceMaster would still own both brands and they would have been more successful at selling -- cross-selling those services. So while it certainly bears watching, it's a tough sled. So we'll see what they do."

So if, in fact, this were to be a lot worse than what -- at least what it's been so far, we feel like we were prepared from a payroll standpoint and a discretionary standpoint.
And as we've moved through time and as we've seen some of the business come back and as we've seen pockets in some areas flourish, especially on the residential side, we've adjusted the payroll based on that. So we continue to manage on the discretionary side very closely. And we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to monitor that. I've stolen my boss's saying that there are still more unknowns than knowns at this point in time.

I would point to, one, the continued growth of our mosquito product. If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue.

If we go back 2 years -- if we go back 3 years ago, it was roughly 1.7% of our total revenue. Now it's grown to 2.8% of our total revenue, which again, is not necessarily material at this point in time yet, but the growth rate has been very strong over now going on a 4-year time period. And I think if you were to ask our folks, they would believe that we have a good opportunity to grow this product for many years to come. It's a great add on. It's our highest retention service that we have. Once people have it, they know that their lifestyle has changed. So I think that's one thing that's going to continue to help us drive on that residential market. When customers have more than one product -- if they take more than one service from us, their likelihood of staying with us doubles over that time period. So if they were only a pest control customer, and now we add on mosquito to that, it doubles their average time that they stay with us. So when we have less turnover from a customer standpoint, that's going to help us continue to make sure that we're growing as we move into the future. And then the second point that I would make would be what we're seeing as far as the shift of the need one from services from the newest homeowners, the general folks that are the newest homeowners that are out there, the millennials that are the newest homeowners that are out there, they gravitate -- kind of stereotypically seem to gravitate more towards services, paying for food delivery, paying for things like that. And we believe that the services that we offer are also going to potentially fall into that category, and we're seeing a good take rate from the newest homeowners that are out there."

Looking at our third quarter performance, we are pleased to report another solid result, and we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. 
Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our 9-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. 
Turning to our business lines results. Residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of this service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic toll. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter. And for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. 
Overall, our people and business continues to perform well in what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset, and we're grateful for their efforts. Further, our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in us. 
Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, who many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing Rollins strategic initiatives over the years. This promotion is truly a testament to his leadership work ethic and talent. Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pets control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He has successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Lathan Test and OPC services as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader, Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little-known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, its direction in its future. We look forward to their continued contributions. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?"

I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. 
While the coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter and how we are executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid. Our call centers are busy, and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged yet, at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we have been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as the third quarter progressed, and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. 
Still, we are, by no way, thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment. And with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We are executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer-facing employees, we are continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. 
We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective in quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we are pleased with the very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter, we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out West as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now, we have not had any significant business disruption. 
I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brands, who have experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include live trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America, and looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. 
Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all, he is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years improve every operation has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. 
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

I believe that every reference that could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. 
In 2016, we had our first ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our management -- of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing of the baton, and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them have been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization. And as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. 
The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside, and our operations and nonoperations groups have made tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today, I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included: improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter; impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E; and the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million, up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before taxes was $115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for our divesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pension divesting were noncash items. Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. 
Looking at the first 9 months revenue of $1.625 billion, that was an increase of 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% above 2019. Net income was $198.2 million, up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non GAAP financials, taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration, were income before taxes of $274.5 million, up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the 9 months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. 
As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million onetime charge to revalue our inventory. With pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter, down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense through Q2 of 2021. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increased 4.9%. That included 1.4% from acquisitions and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which was a small portion of that, but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 10.5%; commercial, ex fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue, was down 1.9%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that, residential was up 9%; commercial, ex fumigation, decreased 3.7%; and termite and ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well. And the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as I referenced, related to the inventory revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $714,000 to $22.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $838,000 or 0.005% to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues, down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent $79.9 million on acquisitions compared to $431.2 million in the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had $17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash, of which $62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.

On the residential, as we're growing, it gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year [indiscernible] per mile improvement in the quarter, which is positive. And I think those types of things, to your -- to the point of your question, are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back have been brought back at this point in time. And I think that both our operations and our nonoperations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways, as many organizations have, to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. 
So I don't have a defined answer, an exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth, we'll get a more and a better clear answer to that. The good news is, from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side come back into the business."

On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle. We made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2, with our customers that we made the decision to do that with. We really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high-profile bankruptcies that you read about and that we read about, a lot of those, in cases, are our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year. So well before the pandemic occurred, they were on our watch list. We were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. 
But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day, and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower, but on the residential side with a positive impact."

Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base of what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now as far as when it comes time to lap this, can't answer that either just because we just don't know. We don't know that people continue to work from home. Will we have situations where there's additional need for more services? We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher because as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase.

Looking at our third quarter performance, we are pleased to report another solid result, and we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. 
Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our 9-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. 
Turning to our business lines results. Residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of this service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic toll. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter. And for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. 
Overall, our people and business continues to perform well in what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset, and we're grateful for their efforts. Further, our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in us. 
Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, who many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing Rollins strategic initiatives over the years. This promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. 
Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins' President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pets control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He has successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest and OPC Services as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader, Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little-known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, its direction in its future. We look forward to their continued contributions. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?"

I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. 
While the coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter and how we are executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid. Our call centers are busy, and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged yet, at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we have been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as the third quarter progressed, and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. 
Still, we are, by no way, thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment. And with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We are executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer-facing employees, we are continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. 
We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective in quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we are pleased with the very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter, we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out West as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now, we have not had any significant business disruption. 
I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brands, who have experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include live trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America, and looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. 
Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all, he is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. 
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

I believe that every reference that could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. 
In 2016, we had our first-ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our management -- of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing of the baton, and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them have been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization. And as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. 
The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside, and our operations and nonoperations groups have made tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today, I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included: improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter; impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E; and the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million, up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before taxes was $115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for our divesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pension divesting were noncash items. Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. 
Looking at the first 9 months revenue of $1.625 billion, that was an increase of 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% above 2019. Net income was $198.2 million, up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials, taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration, were income before taxes of $274.5 million, up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the 9 months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. 
As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million onetime charge to revalue our inventory. With pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter, down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense through Q2 of 2021. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increased 4.9%. That included 1.4% from acquisitions and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which was a small portion of that, but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 10.5%; commercial, ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue, was down 1.9%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that, residential was up 9%; commercial, ex-fumigation, decreased 3.7%; and termite and ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well. And the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as I referenced, related to the inventory revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $714,000 to $22.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $838,000 or 0.5% to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues, down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent $79.9 million on acquisitions compared to $431.2 million in the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had $17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash, of which $62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives, such as our Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local communities. 
In 2021, our employee volunteer goals include: community cleanup efforts, trafficking education awareness, literacy programs and support of the united way, to name a few. Rollins is committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a 3-for-2 stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020, for stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2020.

On the residential, as we're growing, it gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which was -- which is positive. And I think those types of things, to your -- to the point of your question, are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back have been brought back at this point in time. And I think that both our operations and our nonoperations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways, as many organizations have, to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. 
So I don't have a defined answer, an exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth, we'll get a more and a better clear answer to that. The good news is, from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side come back into the business."

And if you think about our larger brands that are going to have residential bases, large residential bases, our Orkin brand, our HomeTeam brand, our Clark brand all have larger residential bases, and we were able to see improvements there. On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle. We made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2, with our customers that we made the decision to do that with. We really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high-profile bankruptcies that you read about and that we read about, a lot of those, in cases, are our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year. So well before the pandemic occurred, that they were on our watch list. We were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. 
But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day, and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower, but on the residential side with a positive impact."

What we see from the disinfectant side, customers that have had some sort of incident occur that need to ensure that they have this taken care of and the cleanliness in their workplace, either for their customers or for their employees, those are the ones that we have a shorter sales cycle for and that want to need to get something in place. Others that know this is the right thing to do that aren't necessarily under that same pressure, we've had a little bit of a longer sales cycle.

Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base than what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now as far as when it comes time to lap this, can't answer that either. Just because we just don't know, we don't know that people continue to work from home. Will we have situations where there's additional need for more services? We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher because as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase. And John was sharing that at least in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there.

Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our 9-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. 
Turning to our business lines results. Residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of this service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic toll. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter. And for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. 
Overall, our people and business continues to perform well in what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset, and we're grateful for their efforts. Further, our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in us. 
Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, who many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing Rollins strategic initiatives over the years. This promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. 
Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins' President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pets control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He has successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest and OPC Services as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader, Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little-known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, its direction in its future. We look forward to their continued contributions. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?"

I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. 
While the coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter and how we are executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid. Our call centers are busy, and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged yet, at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we have been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as the third quarter progressed, and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. 
Still, we are, by no way, thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment. And with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We are executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer-facing employees, we are continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. 
We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective in quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we are pleased with the very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter, we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out West as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now, we have not had any significant business disruption. 
I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brands, who have experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include live trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America, and looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. 
Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all, he is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. 
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

I believe that every reference that could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. 
In 2016, we had our first-ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our management -- of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing of the baton, and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them have been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization. And as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. 
The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside, and our operations and nonoperations groups have made tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today, I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included: improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter; impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E; and the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million, up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before taxes was $115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for our divesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pension divesting were noncash items. Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. 
Looking at the first 9 months revenue of $1.625 billion, that was an increase of 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% above 2019. Net income was $198.2 million, up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials, taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration, were income before taxes of $274.5 million, up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the 9 months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. 
As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million onetime charge to revalue our inventory. With pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter, down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense through Q2 of 2021. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increased 4.9%. That included 1.4% from acquisitions and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which was a small portion of that, but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 10.5%; commercial, ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue, was down 1.9%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that, residential was up 9%; commercial, ex-fumigation, decreased 3.7%; and termite and ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well. And the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as I referenced, related to the inventory revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $714,000 to $22.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $838,000 or 0.5% to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues, down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent $79.9 million on acquisitions compared to $431.2 million in the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had $17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash, of which $62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives, such as our Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local communities. 
In 2021, our employee volunteer goals include: community cleanup efforts, trafficking education awareness, literacy programs and support of the united way, to name a few. Rollins is committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a 3-for-2 stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020, for stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2020.

On the residential, as we're growing, it gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which was -- which is positive. And I think those types of things, to your -- to the point of your question, are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back have been brought back at this point in time. And I think that both our operations and our nonoperations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways, as many organizations have, to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. 
So I don't have a defined answer, an exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth, we'll get a more and a better clear answer to that. The good news is, from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side come back into the business."

We really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high-profile bankruptcies that you read about and that we read about, a lot of those, in cases, are our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas.

But I can't really -- I don't know that we really know exactly how much of this is being driven by someone at home that is adding the mosquito versus that they would want the mosquito. Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base than what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now as far as when it comes time to lap this, can't answer that either. Just because we just don't know, we don't know that people continue to work from home. Will we have situations where there's additional need for more services? We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher because as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase. And John was sharing that at least in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there. So good customer growth and probably the best that we could say at this point."

Looking at our third quarter performance, we are pleased to report another solid result, and we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. 
Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our 9-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. 
Turning to our business lines results. Residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of this service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic toll. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter. And for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. 
Overall, our people and business continues to perform well in what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset, and we're grateful for their efforts. Further, our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in us. 
Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, who many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing Rollins strategic initiatives over the years. This promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. 
Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins' President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pets control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He has successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest and OPC Services as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader, Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little-known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, its direction in its future. We look forward to their continued contributions. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?"

I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. 
While the coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter and how we are executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid. Our call centers are busy, and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged yet, at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we have been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as the third quarter progressed, and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. 
Still, we are, by no way, thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment. And with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We are executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer-facing employees, we are continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. 
We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective in quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we are pleased with the very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter, we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out West as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now, we have not had any significant business disruption. 
I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brands, who have experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include live trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America, and looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. 
Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all, he is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. 
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

I believe that every reference that could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. 
In 2016, we had our first-ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our management -- of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing of the baton, and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them have been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization. And as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. 
The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside, and our operations and nonoperations groups have made tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today, I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included: improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter; impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E; and the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million, up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before taxes was $115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for our divesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pension divesting were noncash items. Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. 
Looking at the first 9 months revenue of $1.625 billion, that was an increase of 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% above 2019. Net income was $198.2 million, up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials, taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration, were income before taxes of $274.5 million, up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the 9 months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. 
As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million onetime charge to revalue our inventory. With pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter, down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense through Q2 of 2021. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increased 4.9%. That included 1.4% from acquisitions and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which was a small portion of that, but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 10.5%; commercial, ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue, was down 1.9%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that, residential was up 9%; commercial, ex-fumigation, decreased 3.7%; and termite and ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well. And the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as I referenced, related to the inventory revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $714,000 to $22.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $838,000 or 0.5% to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues, down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent $79.9 million on acquisitions compared to $431.2 million in the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had $17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash, of which $62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.

On the residential, as we're growing, it gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which was -- which is positive. And I think those types of things, to your -- to the point of your question, are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back have been brought back at this point in time. And I think that both our operations and our nonoperations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways, as many organizations have, to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. 
So I don't have a defined answer, an exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth, we'll get a more and a better clear answer to that. The good news is, from Q2 to Q3, we continue to see those margins positively impacted even as we've had more revenue on the residential side and even more revenue on the commercial side come back into the business."

On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle. We made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2, with our customers that we made the decision to do that with. We really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high-profile bankruptcies that you read about and that we read about, a lot of those, in cases, are our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year. So well before the pandemic occurred, that they were on our watch list. We were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. 
But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day, and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower, but on the residential side with a positive impact."

Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base than what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now as far as when it comes time to lap this, can't answer that either. Just because we just don't know, we don't know that people continue to work from home. Will we have situations where there's additional need for more services? We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher because as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase.

Looking at our third quarter performance, we are pleased to report another solid result, and we remain proud of our planned execution across all of our business service lines. 
Revenue grew 4.9% to $583.7 million compared to $556.5 million for the same quarter in 2019. Net income rose to $79.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $44.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of last year. Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there were meaningful adjustments impacting our financials. Revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $1.62 billion, an increase of 7.6% compared to $1.51 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the first 9 months increased to $198.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $152.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the comparable period last year. Again, Eddie will review these and our 9-month non-GAAP results in a few minutes. 
Turning to our business lines results. Residential pest control grew 10.5% during the quarter, reflecting the resiliency of this service and its strong demand. As anticipated, our commercial operation revenue was down year-over-year as commercial pest control continues to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 virus and its related economic toll. However, some businesses reopened during the quarter. And for some of these customers, their economic conditions improved. We've continued to narrow the revenue shortfall gap each month since April. Overall, we were pleased with the steady progress we've achieved under those circumstances. John will provide greater detail on these and our other operational results shortly. 
Overall, our people and business continues to perform well in what remains a complex environment. We have an unwavering commitment to keep our employees and customers safe. Our team's continued dedication in serving our customers has been outstanding. They are truly our greatest asset, and we're grateful for their efforts. Further, our commitment to safe practices involved our employees and customers as well. We continue to benefit from the high regard, trust and confidence that our customers have in us. 
Before turning the call over to John, I also want to acknowledge some recent key advancements that further strengthen our executive leadership. John Wilson, who many of you know through his involvement on our earnings conference calls and investor meetings, was promoted to the company's Vice Chairman. John joined the company in 1996 and has been an integral part in developing and executing Rollins strategic initiatives over the years. This promotion is truly a testament to his leadership, work ethic and talent. 
Additionally, Jerry Gahlhoff was promoted to Rollins' President and COO. Since many of you may not be too familiar with Jerry's background, I'd like to take a minute and highlight a few of his many accomplishments. Jerry started his career in the pets control industry in 1991 and came to Rollins in the HomeTeam acquisition in 2008. He has successfully managed several areas of the company and has been instrumental in guiding meaningful growth and profitability in these businesses. He most recently led what we refer to as the Rollins specialty brands team, which includes HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest control, Northwest Exterminating, Western Pest, Waltham Pest and OPC Services as well as our very important Rollins human resources department and training department. A seasoned executive and well-respected industry leader, Jerry has a comprehensive understanding of our organization, business and is extremely well suited for the COO position. Another little-known fact is that Jerry came from an Orkin household as his dad was a 26-year employee. We're fortunate to have John and Jerry assume a greater role in our company, its direction in its future. We look forward to their continued contributions. 
Let me now turn the call over to John, who will provide more details on the aspect of our third quarter. John?"

I wanted to start by providing some context to the current environment. 
While the coronavirus remains prevalent in many areas, we feel positive about our financial performance this quarter and how we are executing as a company to meet the needs of our residential and commercial customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. Our residential business remains solid. Our call centers are busy, and we are pleased with our results from this service line. We are also encouraged yet, at the same time, cautiously optimistic about the positive trends we have been seeing on the commercial side of our business. As Gary noted, our third quarter commercial results were down year-over-year. However, the operating environment steadily improved as the third quarter progressed, and we continue to see month-to-month improvements as more businesses reopened and the trust that our brands have built over time have enabled our technicians to provide service when and where needed. 
Still, we are, by no way, thinking that this pandemic is over. We remain diligent considering the current operating environment. And with many experts projecting that another wave is possible, there remain many uncertainties. We are executing against our plan and continue to proactively navigate the best path forward. For example, out of concern for the health of our employees as well as our customers, stringent safety practices are ongoing and remain a top priority. To keep our technicians safe, we continue to adhere to the advanced health and safety protocols as recommended by the CDC. By providing a full complement of personal protective equipment for our customer-facing employees, we are continuing to build trust with our customers, while also demonstrating it is safe to do business with us. 
We are also working with our customers to create a safer environment for where they live and work. As we have discussed, Orkin and many of our other brands are now offering a commercial and residential disinfection service, which is effective in quickly and thoroughly eliminating a wide variety of serious pathogens. While it is still early, we are pleased with the very positive reception this new service line has been receiving from existing as well as new customers. During the third quarter, we steadily grew this new offering. Additionally, investors have asked us about the business impact of the devastating wildfires out West as well as the recent tropical storms and hurricanes that have made landfall in the U.S. While our hearts go out to those that have been adversely affected by these natural disasters, up to now, we have not had any significant business disruption. 
I would also like to take a minute to provide an update on our wildlife brands, who have experienced strong double-digit growth year-to-date. For those of you who aren't too familiar with this business segment, the services we provide include live trapping and removal of wildlife, exclusion of wildlife from residences and other buildings and the repair and remediation of damages caused by wildlife. There is not a more urgent call for help than that customer who has a wild animal loose in their home or business. Although a small part of our total business, we have firmly established our position as the leading wildlife control provider in North America, and looking ahead, we believe that this is real opportunity to continue to grow this business. 
Lastly, I wanted to circle back to the promotion of Jerry to President and Chief Operating Officer. Not only does he have a strong foundation in the pest business, he does have a degree in entomology after all, he is that rarest of individuals who knows both bugs and the bug business inside out. He works very hard at improving himself each day. And I've watched him over the last 13 years improve every operation he has touched. I am excited to have Jerry in this new role. 
I'll now turn the call over to Eddie."

I believe that every reference that could be made regarding how long the last quarter has been has already been used, so I'm going to spare my attempt. I would like to pass along my thanks to your outreach regarding our late Chairman. Your words of reflection and support were truly appreciated. 
In 2016, we had our first-ever Investor Day in New York City, and our team had a chance to get to know many of you on that day. The primary reason for holding that event was to share the depth and breadth of our management -- of our senior management team. I've had discussions with many of you over the years about the eventual passing of the baton, and the elevation of Gary, John and Jerry show this in action. Each of them have been well prepared for years to take their perspective and vision to lead Rollins for years to come. We're fortunate as an organization. And as investors, I believe that you will be pleased with what the future holds. 
The obstacles that impacted Q2 began to subside, and our operations and nonoperations groups have made tremendous adjustments to the new life that we are all leading. Today, I'll share some details on our Q3 actual results and some additional insight to what we know today that will impact the future. For the quarter, our residential pest control and termite service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included: improvements in commercial revenue growth rates compared to the second quarter; impairment charges related to our personal protective equipment, also known as PP&E; and the successful continued cost management implemented to drive margin improvements year-over-year. 
As Gary referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials that were impacted by vesting of shares this year and the impact of the pension plan moving off of our Rollins books in Q3 of 2019. Looking at the numbers, the third quarter revenues of $583.7 million was an increase of 4.9% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $556.5 million. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $108.9 million or 136% above 2019. Net income was $79.6 million, up 80.6% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.24 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, our income before taxes was $115.6 million this year compared to $96 million last year, a 20.4% increase. Our 2020 income before taxes was impacted by $6.7 million for the vesting of our late Chairman's Rollins shares. Additionally, 2019 was reduced by $49.9 million for our divesting of the pension plan off of our Rollins books. Both the vesting of shares and pension divesting were noncash items. Our non-GAAP net income was $86.3 million this year compared to $70.6 million in Q3 of 2019, a 22.1% increase. 
Looking at the first 9 months revenue of $1.625 billion, that was an increase of 7.6% over the prior year's third quarter revenue of $1.509 billion. Our GAAP income before income taxes was $267.8 million or 41.6% above 2019. Net income was $198.2 million, up 29.9% compared to 2019. Our GAAP earnings per share were $0.60 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP financials, taking the share vesting and pension plan into consideration, were income before taxes of $274.5 million, up 14.8% and net income was $204.9 million this year compared to $179.2 million in 2019, a 14.4% increase. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the 9 months were $0.63 compared to $0.55, which is a 14.5% increase. 
As we stated on our Q1 and Q2 calls, we began aggressively purchasing personal protective equipment in March and April. While these were costly, they were critical to keeping our operations running safely. As the cost of these materials have moved lower from the peak, we took a $2 million onetime charge to revalue our inventory. With pricing moving lower, we anticipate spending $1 million per quarter, down from the $2 million that we shared on previous calls. At this time, we would anticipate having this additional expense through Q2 of 2021. 
Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service lines for the third quarter. Our total revenue increased 4.9%. That included 1.4% from acquisitions and the remaining 3.5% was from pricing, which was a small portion of that, but mostly from organic and new customer growth. In total, residential pest control, which made up 47% of our revenue, was up 10.5%; commercial, ex-fumigation pest control, which made up 34% of our revenue, was down 1.9%; and termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 18% of our revenue, was up 6.2%. Again, total revenue less acquisitions was up 3.5% and from that, residential was up 9%; commercial, ex-fumigation, decreased 3.7%; and termite and ancillary grew by 5.9%. Our residential business continues to perform well. And the business on the commercial side has seen steady improvement each month since April. While we continue to manage our costs appropriately, it's difficult to know how the revenue levels will look as we move through the pandemic with restrictions continuing to change throughout the world. 
In total, gross margin increased to 52.8% from 51.7% in the prior year's quarter. The quarter was positively impacted by lower service and administrative salary expenses as well as lower fuel expense and continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. Additionally, materials and supplies were up, as I referenced, related to the inventory revaluation of our personal protective equipment. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $714,000 to $22.4 million, an increase of 3.3%. Depreciation increased $1 million due to acquisitions, vehicles acquired and equipment purchases, while amortization of intangible assets decreased $286,000 due to the full amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions, including HomeTeam and tuck-ins related to Orkin. 
Sales, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter increased $838,000 or 0.5% to $168 million or 28.8% of revenues, down from 30% last year. The quarter produced savings in salaries and benefits, lower fuel and bad debt through better collection efforts. As for our cash position for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2020, we spent $79.9 million on acquisitions compared to $431.2 million in the same period last year, which included the acquisition of Clark Pest Control. We paid $91.7 million on dividends and had $17.7 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly lower compared to 2019. We ended the period with $95.4 million in cash, of which $62.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
Before I close, I would like to give an update on one of our sustainability initiatives, particularly as it relates to our local communities. Through corporate and brand initiatives, such as our Rollins United and Northwest Good Deeds Teams, Rollins employees across all brands are strongly encouraged to volunteer within our local communities. 
In 2021, our employee volunteer goals include: community cleanup efforts, trafficking education awareness, literacy programs and support of the united way, to name a few. Rollins is committed to giving back to our communities through a strong philanthropic vision. Please go to rollins.com under the Investor Relations tab to view the full 2020 sustainability report. 
Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a large regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share plus a special dividend of $0.13 that will be paid on December 20, 2020, to stockholders of record at the close of business November 10, 2020. In addition, they also announced a 3-for-2 stock split that will take effect December 10, 2020, for stockholders of record at the close of business on November 10, 2020.

On the residential, as we're growing, it gives us the ability to be able to do that smoothly. And on the commercial side, it allows us to kind of reduce some of the noise that we would have by being able to schedule. We had one of the best quarters, which we didn't go through in detail. We had one of the best quarters as far as year-over-year stops per mile improvement in the quarter, which was -- which is positive. And I think those types of things, to your -- to the point of your question, are more structural in nature. I believe that the majority of the folks that we had furloughed as we went into the pandemic that are going to be brought back have been brought back at this point in time. And I think that both our operations and our nonoperations groups absolutely are leaner than when we started. We've been forced to find ways, as many organizations have, to use technology in ways that have made us more efficient. 
So I don't have a defined answer, an exact answer for you. We will be leaner and margins will be better as a part of this as we're moving forward. But I think as we see that revenue growth, we'll get a more and a better clear answer to that.

And if you think about our larger brands that are going to have residential bases, large residential bases, our Orkin brand, our HomeTeam brand, our Clark brand all have larger residential bases, and we were able to see improvements there. On the commercial side, obviously, that continues to be a struggle. We made adjustments to payment terms, mostly in Q2, with our customers that we made the decision to do that with. We really didn't have a lot of new customers in Q3 where we request and we made adjustments for that. But the high-profile bankruptcies that you read about and that we read about, a lot of those, in cases, are our customers. So we've worked really diligently to minimize our exposure in those areas. And the news for us there is that a lot of those customers that are on that bankruptcy list have been on that list for the past year. So well before the pandemic occurred, that they were on our watch list. We were minimizing our exposure at that point in time. 
But the reality is the customers that are struggling to stay in business today are just working day-to-day, and we're trying to work with them as a partner. But the collections on that side is slightly slower, but on the residential side with a positive impact."

What we see from the disinfectant side, customers that have had some sort of incident occur that need to ensure that they have this taken care of and the cleanliness in their workplace, either for their customers or for their employees, those are the ones that we have a shorter sales cycle for and that want to need to get something in place. Others that know this is the right thing to do that aren't necessarily under that same pressure, we've had a little bit of a longer sales cycle. And we're learning as we continue to move forward, but it continues to grow for us, but I would say if you had to differentiate between those 2 that we've had more incremental business that has come back."

Our mosquito continues to grow at a 30%-plus rate as it has for the previous few years. That's a little bit of a higher base. It's still a low base, but it's a little bit of a higher base than what we've seen previously. But we are seeing good new customer growth that has come out of this. Now as far as when it comes time to lap this, can't answer that either. Just because we just don't know, we don't know that people continue to work from home. Will we have situations where there's additional need for more services? We anticipate that our retention of those customers will be higher because as we talked before, as we add an additional service, the retention of those customers improves for us. So as they add mosquito or as they add one of our other services, that retention rate does increase. And John was sharing that at least in our Orkin brand that we've seen that across the board in all of our services there.
