The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company. 
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. 
Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hope to protect our balance sheet. 
Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case. 
Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019. 
On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. 
Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier. 
In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points. 
In both our Asia and LATAM businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio. 
Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant production for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment. 
MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%. 
The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the Alico acquisition from 66 markets to 44 and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile. 
On simplify, we will over-deliver on our UCI cost saving target and going forward, will adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next 5 years. 
On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead. 
In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 independent directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders. 
We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus. 
For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife. 
When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today. 
First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. 
In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and a very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow and our 65% to 75% range. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail."
185648,650356744,1901381,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 3. The schedule provid",2196,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. 
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected. 
Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after-tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after-tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after-tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. 
As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. 
Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share. 
Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years, and the matter is closed. 
On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. 
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. 
The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. 
In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads are up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020. 
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions.  Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9%, as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. 
Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels, had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chilean and Kai. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18. 
Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur. 
With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. 
For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%. 
And now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. 
Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter, and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. 
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015. 
The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter. 
Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses. 
In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. 
We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%. 
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion, and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019. 
We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient. 
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

I think we would say it's a very strong quarter for us, and we're extremely pleased with those results. 
To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press. 
If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business, is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed. From the ones we've given you in December, and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid towards the middle of that range. 
From a competitive environment, it is competitive, it's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity, in particular, where we see white space for further growth."

Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 Fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term. 
In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom, you see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate that's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little a few months before it's fully recognized there. So I'll let Steve add some color."

Remember, we're focusing -- from a pipeline perspective, we are focusing on the larger end of the market. So these are big pension plans, mid-single digits, but sometimes even higher with respect to the size of these plans. That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation. So having said all of that, and given the market we're focused on, we're still seeing a very robust 2020 in that segment that we're looking at."

As we look forward, I can tell you, we're looking at these trends very closely. We're pulling a range of levers, which are at our disposal, beginning with rate actions where we've accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020, but we're also looking at underwriting and claims practices. So we're on top of this. I could say with respect to the auto line, in particular, where we stand today, our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto, albeit towards the upper end of that range. So if you recall, that's a 93% to 98% for the auto business."

In terms of the business, to date, we have not seen a significant impact on our business through January from the situation there. But facts and circumstances may change, of course, as the situation evolves. 
So let me talk about the reform, which, I think, is your other question. The government finally managed to present the project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project is enacted as a lot. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that it's being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good -- it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvement that introduces and hopefully, will help to help to ease the social situation there, if the project is approved.

So there tends to be an elevated. And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q. 
On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter in 4Q that was elevated.

The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet. 
Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case. 
Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019.
On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier.
In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points. 
In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio.
Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment. 
MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%.
The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44, and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile.
On simplify, we will overdeliver on our UCI cost-saving target, and going forward, we'll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next 5 years. 
On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits, such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead. 
In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us, to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders.
We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus.
For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife.
When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today.
First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. 
In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65% to 75% range. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail."
185648,650356744,1901551,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.Starting on Page 3. The schedule provide",2197,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected.
Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share. 
Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed.
On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter.
Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020.
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions. Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18.
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9% as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting.
Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea.
Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18.
Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur. 
With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range.
Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. 
For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%.
Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter; and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015.
The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter.
Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses.
In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%.
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses.
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019.
We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient.
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Phenomenal, I think we would say, it's a very strong quarter for us, and we're extremely pleased with those results.
To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press. 
If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we've given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid -- towards the middle of that range.
From a competitive environment, it is competitive. It's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular, where we see white space for further growth."

Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term.
In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom. You see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate. It's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little -- a few months before it's fully recognized there. So I'll let Steve add some color."

That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that -- this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation.

So let me talk about the reform, which, I think, is your other question. The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the legislative process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that is being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces, and hopefully, will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved.

And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q.
On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter, in 4Q, that was elevated.

One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter, and I think it was early December, maybe late November, which ultimately provided a company's ability to use some additional foreign tax credits. So that came through in the fourth quarter. And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true-ups and some other year-end tax estimate refinements. So if you exclude those items, it's, call it, $65 million impact, you get to 18.5%. And so that's how you reconcile the quarter ETR."

The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet. 
Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case. 
Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019.
On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier.
In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points. 
In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio.
Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment. 
MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%.
The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44, and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile.
On simplify, we will overdeliver on our UCI cost-saving target, and going forward, we'll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next 5 years. 
On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits, such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead. 
In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us, to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders.
We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus.
For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife.
When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today.
First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. 
In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65% to 75% range. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail."
185648,650356744,1904999,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.Starting on Page 3. The schedule provide",2197,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected.
Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share. 
Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed.
On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter.
Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020.
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions. Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18.
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9% as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting.
Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea.
Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18.
Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur. 
With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range.
Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. 
For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%.
Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter; and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015.
The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter.
Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses.
In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%.
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses.
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019.
We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient.
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press. 
If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we've given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid -- towards the middle of that range.
From a competitive environment, it is competitive. It's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular, where we see white space for further growth."

It's John. Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term.
In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom. You see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate. It's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little -- a few months before it's fully recognized there. So I'll let Steve add some color."

So these are big pension plans, mid-single digits, but sometimes even higher with respect to the size of these plans. That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that -- this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation. So having said all of that and given the market we're focused on, we're still seeing a very robust 2020 in that segment that we're looking at."

And those indications worsened in the fourth quarter, which warranted additional strengthening. And that's a combination of PYDs as well as out-of-period strengthening for '19. 
As we look forward, I can tell you, we're looking at these trends very closely. We're pulling a range of levers, which are at our disposal, beginning with rate actions where we've accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020, but we're also looking at underwriting and claims practices. So we're on top of this. I could say with respect to the auto line, in particular, where we stand today, our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto, albeit towards the upper end of that range.

So let me talk about the reform, which, I think, is your other question. The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the legislative process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that is being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces, and hopefully, will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved.

And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q.
On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter, in 4Q, that was elevated. So we estimate 50 to 60 basis points above what normal trend would be for kind of the fourth quarter. And so you can kind of think of that as what we had expected in the quarter and the additional onetime costs that came through."

And there's other things that go into this, right? I mean, there's other investments being made. So sometimes, it's hard. But as we've said -- and I think, last year, there might have been employee benefit costs that offset that. So the volatility and some of the market impacts from unemployed benefit costs can impact the segments as well. So you might see a little offset, but you can be assured, it's in there."

So it's a series of a few items. One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter, and I think it was early December, maybe late November, which ultimately provided a company's ability to use some additional foreign tax credits. So that came through in the fourth quarter. And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true-ups and some other year-end tax estimate refinements. So if you exclude those items, it's, call it, $65 million impact, you get to 18.5%. And so that's how you reconcile the quarter ETR."

The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet. 
Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case. 
Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019.
On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier.
In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points. 
In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio.
Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment. 
MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%.
The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44, and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile.
On simplify, we will overdeliver on our UCI cost-saving target, and going forward, we'll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next 5 years. 
On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits, such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead. 
In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us, to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders.
We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus.
For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife.
When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today.
First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. 
In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65% to 75% range. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail."
185648,650356744,1905004,"MetLife, Inc., Q4 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 06, 2020",2020-02-06,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.Starting on Page 3. The schedule provide",2197,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected.
Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share. 
Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed.
On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter.
Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020.
Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions. Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18.
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9% as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting.
Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea.
Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18.
Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur. 
With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range.
Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins. 
For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%.
Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter; and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.
Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015.
The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter.
Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses.
In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%.
Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses.
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019.
We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient.
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Phenomenal, I think we would say, it's a very strong quarter for us, and we're extremely pleased with those results.
To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press. 
If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we've given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid -- towards the middle of that range.
From a competitive environment, it is competitive. It's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular, where we see white space for further growth."

It's John. Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term.
In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom. You see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate. It's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little -- a few months before it's fully recognized there.

That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that -- this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation.

As we look forward, I can tell you, we're looking at these trends very closely. We're pulling a range of levers, which are at our disposal, beginning with rate actions where we've accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020, but we're also looking at underwriting and claims practices. So we're on top of this. I could say with respect to the auto line, in particular, where we stand today, our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto, albeit towards the upper end of that range.

The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the legislative process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that is being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces, and hopefully, will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved.

And I make that point only because we have talked about that there is seasonality from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we focus on the annual direct expense ratio. Having said that, let me just kind of recall a few things. So we did say that -- and we've called out previously that the third and fourth quarter tend to be -- tend to be elevated due to the cost, as I mentioned, in my opening remarks for the enrollment of group customers, and we don't get those premiums in until the following year, so this tends to be an elevated. And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q.
On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter, in 4Q, that was elevated. So we estimate 50 to 60 basis points above what normal trend would be for kind of the fourth quarter. And so you can kind of think of that as what we had expected in the quarter and the additional onetime costs that came through."

So it's a series of a few items. One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter, and I think it was early December, maybe late November, which ultimately provided a company's ability to use some additional foreign tax credits. So that came through in the fourth quarter. And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true-ups and some other year-end tax estimate refinements. So if you exclude those items, it's, call it, $65 million impact, you get to 18.5%. And so that's how you reconcile the quarter ETR."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives, care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our progresses to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for. 
At our Investor Day last December, highlight with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement, always with you building a more confident future has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need. 
Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders, our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers and that, in turn, is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities. 
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees coput stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference. 
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia give us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States. 
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home, but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees. 
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and rental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. Metlife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of mass, the infectant white and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help. 
As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need done. 
MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and an risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially. 
MetLife answered the current period of uncertainty from the proportion of spend. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high-quality and ample liquidity. Notably, that our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
Metlife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this pulp brings the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit rating agencies. 
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline. 
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future. 
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. Metlife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets. 
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. 
And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long tail businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short-term and a positive low is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities. 
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago. 
The direct impact on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is reduced on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency. 
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding the OCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36 and up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%. 
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for our time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justified this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted. 
We believe our next horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic drop, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our next horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring. 
MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never quartered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial segment. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. 
Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. 
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. 
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.  With regards to the top line, group benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. 
While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales. 
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowner and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea and lower investment margins. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean and Kahe returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region. 
Metlife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed account. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19. 
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter. 
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% and versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset. 
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography, portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. 
As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return. 
These next 2 slides are -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife investment management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management with a particular focus on private asset origination. 
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure given fall and angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place. 
I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress setters. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. 
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter, given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix. 
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high single to low double digit return. And thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities. 
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program. 
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis, 2Q. 
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife Personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product activities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds. 
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. 
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31, and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020. We estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%. 
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020 forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we made some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels. 
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million, and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31, macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value the range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more structural than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower than. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. 
And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it's important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements you used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. 
And I think the other thing I would just add, this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5 to 4.5. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we've seen every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions.

We are seeing favorable impacts in dental, given the lower utilization. We're seeing actually unfavorable impacts on the life block. And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims. So I think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

But we've been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grading. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day. Bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talked to involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio kind of top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses. 
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of the nearer-term recovery to the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And  the impact on RBC from downgrades in that we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the pre-positioning we've done and based on what we noted, we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

It's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly 1/3 each. But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads, XVII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near-term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

And what we always urge the team to do is make sure we're continuing to take an external perspective doing the work now because if things were to change in those pricing points were to converge a little more, maybe supply gets even that much greater. There could be a various variety of things. We want to be ready and opportunistic if something makes sense for us. But I'd say, just all else equal, yes, lower rates put pressure on doing something in holdings at this juncture."

And in terms of the overall pipeline, it has slowed due to the overall environment. A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic. So we've seen a few deals that were pulled out or put on hold in the first quarter, and we're seeing a somewhat lighter pipeline. If activity were to kind of pick back up in the second half of the year, we expect to get our fair share. And I'd remind you that we were a top 3 player in that market last year. But when you think of RIS, again, remember, RIS has a lot more than PRT. PRT is one product line in the context of a diversified context. And as Michel and John referenced, we've seen a substantial pickup in our stable value business in the last quarter, and we're seeing very healthy over -- year-over-year increase in the liability balances.

So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts. So I think large employers and when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%. 
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about. But nevertheless, we will see growth. 
Two other points. Just to bear in mind, as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for.
At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement: 'Always with you, building a more confident future' has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need.
Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities.
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference.
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States.
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees.
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help.
As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. 
MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and income are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially.
MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies.  
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline.  
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future.
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets.
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short hand and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities.
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago.
The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency.
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted.
We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring.
MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never [ faltered ]. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, ""Always with you,"" and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.
Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other.  
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19.
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years.
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.
With regards to the top line, group benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products.  
While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales.  
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7%, and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region.
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19.
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs.  
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter.  
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset.  
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return.
These next 2 slides are shown -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife investment management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination.  
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio, with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure, given fallen angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place.
I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016.
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm.
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix.
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities.
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program.  
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis, 2Q.
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds.
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses.
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time.  
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%.
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards, and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels.
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. 
Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value to range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. 
And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it's important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add -- this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or a 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we're seeing every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of -- excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of -- we're in a -- I would say, we've had the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks."

We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of 3 to 4 months of forbearance.

We are seeing favorable impacts in dental, given the lower utilization. We're seeing actually unfavorable impacts on the life block. And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we've been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grade. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day, bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talk to who are involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses.
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery till the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer, or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the bottom line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And the impact on RBC from downgrades, in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we noted that we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

And in terms of the overall pipeline, it has slowed due to the overall environment. A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets, and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic. So we've seen a few deals that were pulled out or put on hold in the first quarter, and we're seeing a somewhat lighter pipeline. If activity were to kind of pick back up in the second half of the year, we expect to get our fair share. And I'd remind you that we were a top 3 player in that market last year. But when you think of RIS, again, remember, RIS has a lot more than PRT in it. PRT is one product line in the context of a diversified context.

Let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%.
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth.
Two other points, just to bear in mind as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for.
At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement: 'Always with you, building a more confident future' has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need.
Our next horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities.
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing, they know they are making a difference.
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States.
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees.
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. In times of prices, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 spike. We also had a unique opportunity to help.
As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the State of New York to offer the Intercontinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife create as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. For the power of risk putting, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. 
MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and income are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially.
MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies.  
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline.  
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future.
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets.
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our stable value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short hand and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets, investment products and securities lending activities.
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and Property & Casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These trends enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago.
The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins and group benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency.
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the speeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted.
We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring.
MetLife has seen many such periods during this history, the 1918 flu pandemic, The Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never [ faltered ]. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, ""Always with you,"" and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.
Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other.  
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19.
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years.
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.
With regards to the top line, group benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong stable value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight-to-safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products.  
While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales.  
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7%, and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region.
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19.
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs.  
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter.  
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset.  
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return.
These next 2 slides are shown -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife investment management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination.  
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio, with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure, given fallen angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place.
I would also call to your attention, Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stress sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016.
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm.
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix.
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities.
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program.  
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis, 2Q.
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully-insured dental business within group benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds.
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy and managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio, full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses.
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time.  
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%.
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York domicile statutory company, metropolitan life insurance company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards, and therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels.
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. 
Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is to provide a scenario. We anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to a value to range of credit losses. And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, a year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. 
And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. So I think it's important that to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add -- this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or a 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then on LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we're seeing every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of -- excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of -- we're in a -- I would say, we've had the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks."

We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of 3 to 4 months of forbearance.

And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we've been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about below investment grade. We reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day, bank loans also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody, as you talk to who are involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like, we've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analysis using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is the real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures, we think, are vulnerable to downgrades and losses.
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery till the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer, or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening. And the bottom line assessment is based on what we foresee today, the impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And the impact on RBC from downgrades, in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we noted that we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

So -- and I'm assuming some of that's because of the benefit of this steeper yield curve. So assuming rates stay around here and the yield curves as steep as it is, would you expect your spread to hold up or potentially improve from these levels?"

So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points, but ex VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and -- in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through 3 segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly 1/3 each. But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean, if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10-bit move, it would be a $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

A number of drivers within that, including the funding levels, the volatility in the capital markets, and frankly, the priorities of treasury and HR teams in the context of the pandemic.

Let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%.
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth.
Two other points, just to bear in mind as you think about the timing, we have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with employee population."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for.
At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement, Always with you, building a more confident future, has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need.
Our Next Horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities.
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing. They know they are making a difference.
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States.
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees.
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. 
In times of crisis, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 fight. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the state of New York to offer the InterContinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. 
Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife creates as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. Through the power of risk pooling, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and incomes are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially.
MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies.  
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline.  
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future.
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets.
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our Stable Value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short end and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets investment products and securities lending activities.
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and property and casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These strengths enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago.
The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins in Group Benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency.
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the seeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted.
We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring.
MetLife has seen many such periods during its history: the 1918 flu pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, Always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.
Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other.  
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19.
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years.
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for nonmedical health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.
With regards to the top line, Group Benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong Stable Value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight to safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales.  
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region.
Metlife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19.
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter.  
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset.  
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis, that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return.
These next 2 slides are shown -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination.  
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio, with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure, given fallen angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place.
I would also call to your attention Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stressed sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016.
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm.
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix.
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities.
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program.  
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q.
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully insured dental business within Group Benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds.
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy in managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses.
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%.
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York-domiciled statutory company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards and, therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels.
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is: To provide a scenario, we anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to evaluate a range of credit losses. 
And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, our year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. 
So I think it's important that -- to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add -- this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we've seen in every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of -- excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer, $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of -- we're in a -- I would say, we've hit the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks."

Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you'd expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance requests. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of 3 to 4 months of forbearance. And remember, it's forbearance, not forgiveness. So we do expect that these will always be paid. And by the way, we saw virtually no impact on April payments for the portfolio overall.

And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about: below investment grade, we reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day; bank loans, also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody you talk to involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like. 
We've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analyses using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is a real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures we think are vulnerable to downgrades and losses.
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery. Does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer? Or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening? And the bottom-line assessment is based on what we foresee today. The impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And the impact on RBC from downgrades in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we now today, we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points, but ex VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and -- in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through 3 segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly 1/3 each. 
But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10 bps move, it would be $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

Let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%.
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth.
Two other points just to bear in mind as you think about the timing. We have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with the employee population."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for.
At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement, Always with you, building a more confident future, has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need.
Our Next Horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities.
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing. They know they are making a difference.
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States.
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees.
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. 
In times of crisis, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 fight. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the state of New York to offer the InterContinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. 
Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife creates as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. Through the power of risk pooling, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and incomes are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially.
MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies.  
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline.  
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future.
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets.
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our Stable Value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short end and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets investment products and securities lending activities.
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and property and casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These strengths enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago.
The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins in Group Benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency.
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the seeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted.
We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring.
MetLife has seen many such periods during its history: the 1918 flu pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, Always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion.

This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other.  
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19.
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years.
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for nonmedical health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.
With regards to the top line, Group Benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong Stable Value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight to safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales.  
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region.
Metlife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19.
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter.  
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset.  
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis, that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return.
These next 2 slides are shown -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination.  
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio, with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure, given fallen angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place.
I would also call to your attention Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stressed sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016.
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm.
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix.
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities.
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program.  
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q.
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully insured dental business within Group Benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds.
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy in managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses.
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%.
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York-domiciled statutory company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards and, therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels.
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is: To provide a scenario, we anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to evaluate a range of credit losses. 
And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, our year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. 
So I think it's important that -- to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add -- this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we've seen in every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of -- excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer, $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of -- we're in a -- I would say, we've hit the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks."

Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you'd expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance requests. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of 3 to 4 months of forbearance.

And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about: below investment grade, we reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day; bank loans, also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody you talk to involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like. 
We've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analyses using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is a real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures we think are vulnerable to downgrades and losses.
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery. Does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer? Or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening? And the bottom-line assessment is based on what we foresee today. The impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And the impact on RBC from downgrades in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we now today, we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

So yes, spreads were in line with what we've kind of been forecasting for the last few quarters as we said before and coming in at 114 basis points, but ex VII, 83 basis points. And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and -- in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through 3 segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly 1/3 each. 
But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10 bps move, it would be $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

If activity were to kind of pick back up in the second half of the year, we expect to get our fair share. And I'd remind you that we were a top 3 player in that market last year. 
But when you think of RIS, again, remember, RIS has a lot more than PRT in it. PRT is one product line in the context of a diversified context.

Let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%.
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth.
Two other points just to bear in mind as you think about the timing. We have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with the employee population."

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that so many people have endured as a result of the pandemic. What the world has been living through its tragic, yet it is also demonstrating the best of humanity. We see this every day as thousands of first responders, health care workers and other frontline employees risk their lives to care for others and provide essential services. And we see it at MetLife as our employees go above and beyond to deliver on our promises to customers. While we feel the effects of the crisis deeply, both the personal loss and the economic disruption, these are the moments that MetLife is built for.
At our Investor Day last December, I led with the importance we place on being a purpose-driven company. Our purpose statement, Always with you, building a more confident future, has taken on greater meaning in the current environment. People are counting on us like never before to provide the value, support and financial security they need.
Our Next Horizon strategy is a road map for how the company will create value for all of its stakeholders: our people, our customers, our shareholders and our communities. As I have said before, it is our people who will deliver for our customers, and that in turn is how we will create value for our shareholders and communities.
It starts with our people, which means making their health and well-being our top priority. We've done that in a variety of ways. We rapidly moved employees to a work-from-home environment, expanded benefit to help cover COVID-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support to help employees cope with stress and deployed tools and resources to keep people connected. I am proud of the level of engagement and motivation our people are showing. They know they are making a difference.
Since we do business in many markets, MetLife got an early look at how the pandemic could affect societies and our own operations. Our experience in Asia gave us a running start on the activation of our business continuity plan globally. Across our enterprise, 92% of our 38,000 non-agent employees are now working from home, including 98% in the United States.
Of course, the true test of our business continuity plan was not merely whether employees could log on from home but whether they had full functionality to be able to deliver for our customers. On this front, we are very pleased that we've been able to maintain service levels with 95% of all customer calls, claims and other transactions successfully handled by employees working remotely. This includes our group insurance business, where even in this highly disrupted environment, MetLife still expects to meet or exceed its performance guarantees.
For our customers, this moment is crucial. The way we show up now will resonate with them for years to come. Across the enterprise, we are acting to provide them with comprehensive and compassionate care. We are extending premium grace period, fast-tracking claims, crediting or adjusting auto and dental premiums and providing our digital financial wellness portal to small businesses and their employees at no cost. 
The shutdown of face-to-face distribution has also spurred us to innovate and accelerate the digital transformation of our business. In China, for example, sales of our medical reimbursement product rose sharply after we created a WeChat store for agents. 
In times of crisis, we must do more for the communities where we work and live. MetLife Foundation has committed $25 million and MetLife has donated millions of dollars and thousands of masks, disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers to the COVID-19 fight. We also had a unique opportunity to help. As a large commercial real estate investor, we were pleased to work with the state of New York to offer the InterContinental Times Square as free housing for medical workers. 
Most impactful is the social and economic benefit MetLife creates as a life insurance company. The heart of our business is a promise to pay when people need us most. Through the power of risk pooling, the premiums of the many become payment to those who need them. MetLife paid more than $24 billion in policyholder claims, benefits and dividends in the U.S. alone last year, an average of more than $65 million a day. At a time when peoples' jobs and incomes are at risk, life insurers form a vital part of the social safety net that sustains people financially.
MetLife entered the current period of uncertainty from the position of strength. As you know, we've made substantial changes to our strategy and product portfolio. The biggest change is to the profile of our liabilities. We are now a less market-sensitive and capital-intensive company. At our Investor Day, we showed that approximately 2/3 of our adjusted earnings came from protection and fee-based products and only 1/3 from spread-related businesses. 
Within our investment portfolio, we took early action in anticipation of a recession. Beginning in 2018, we became concerned about certain lower-rated areas of the credit markets. We reduced our holdings in sectors and names that we thought would carry heightened risk in a downturn. Overall, our investment portfolio is marked by broad diversification, high quality and ample liquidity. Notably, at our operating insurance companies, we have nearly $100 billion of U.S. government and agency securities, Japan government bonds and other cash and short-term investments. 
MetLife has also further strengthened its already strong capital and liquidity position. As part of our planned capital actions, in late March, we accessed the bond market when few others could to raise $1 billion. For the quarter, this helped bring the company's total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $5.3 billion. Our combined U.S. NAIC risk-based capital ratio as of year-end 2019 was 395%, and we enjoy higher ratings from all major credit-rating agencies.  
Another proactive step we've taken is to increase our focus on expenses. MetLife remains committed to meeting the expense target we set as part of our unit cost initiative program. In the current environment, perhaps no area gives us greater opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to consistent execution than expense discipline.  
As we announced last week, our financial strength enabled us to increase our quarterly common stock dividend, which provides a steady and growing source of income to millions of people during this economically challenging time. We raised our second quarter 2020 common stock dividend by 4.5%, which illustrates our confidence in MetLife's future.
Given our strong starting position, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be an earnings event, not a balance sheet event. MetLife has a great set of globally diversified businesses, some of which may be pressured by today's unprecedented events while others act as offsets.
Take our Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, business. While we are seeing a slowdown in new pension risk transfer deals, we are also seeing a surge in demand for our Stable Value offerings as 401(k) sponsors and participants seek the safety of these book value products backed by MetLife. And although rollover reinvestment rates continue to be pressured for our long-tailed businesses in RIS, the current configuration of the yield curve, very low at the short end and a positive slope, is favorable for our capital markets investment products and securities lending activities.
Similar balance exists across our global protection businesses, where mortality, morbidity, longevity and property and casualty risks serve as natural offsets. At the core, our scale, strong balance sheet and broad diversification are key strengths of our franchise. These strengths enabled us to generate first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.58 per share, up 7% from a year ago.
The direct impacts on our adjusted earnings from the pandemic and economic slowdown were limited. Adjusted earnings reflected strong underwriting margins in Group Benefits and favorable underwriting margins in Property & Casualty. Variable investment income was very strong mostly due to private equity, which is registered on a one quarter lag. These positives were offset in part by unfavorable market factors across interest rates, equities and foreign currency.
Net income was $4.4 billion or $4.75 per share, up from $1.40 per year prior. Falling interest rates drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $52.36, up 7% sequentially from year-end, while adjusted return on equity on the same basis totaled 12.6%.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate the greatest earnings impact will be felt within variable investment income, where we expect less favorable private equity returns for a time. The strong historical returns associated with our private equity portfolio and its role as a good match for our long-dated liabilities justify this asset class as an important ongoing component of the general account. In fact, the current economic turmoil is precisely the environment where the seeds of tomorrow's private equity returns are being planted.
We believe our Next Horizon strategy was the right approach before the pandemic struck, and we are even more confident that the pillars of focus, simplify and differentiate are the right approach today. By focusing even more intently on where we deploy capital and by further simplifying the company, we will enable MetLife to emerge from the current environment in the best shape possible. If anything, we must accelerate our Next Horizon work. This is how we will truly differentiate MetLife and capture the opportunities that periods of disruptions always bring.
MetLife has seen many such periods during its history: the 1918 flu pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, 9/11, the financial crisis. Through all of them, we never faltered. We maintained our financial strength, kept our promises and provided people with the security and confidence they need. That's what we mean when we say, Always with you, and it will be true throughout this pandemic and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to John McCallion."

I'll start with the first quarter 2020 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information on our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slides provide more detail on our investments, outlook for the second quarter as well as an update of our cash and capital positions.  
Starting on Page 3. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $4.4 billion or approximately $3 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative gains resulting from the significant decline in interest rates during the quarter. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.
Turning to Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $55 million associated with our unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other.  
Excluding the unit cost in the first quarter of 2019, adjusted earnings were down 2% and essentially flat on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.
Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong variable investment income, solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and lower taxes. This was offset by equity market weakness, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting compared to first quarter of '19.
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 9% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our annual target range of 85% to 90%, but less favorable to the exceptionally strong prior year quarter of 85.3%, which was the best first quarter mortality ratio in over 15 years.
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for nonmedical health was 71.7%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 72.9%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from higher claim recoveries, lower incidents and lower severity.
With regards to the top line, Group Benefit adjusted PFOs were up 7% due to solid growth across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 26% year-over-year. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 114 basis points, up 18 basis points year-over-year and up 8 basis points sequentially. Spreads in the quarter benefited from higher private equity returns and a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 9%, driven by very strong growth in the second half of 2019 and exceptionally strong Stable Value sales in the quarter, which benefited from a flight to safety amid the turbulent equity markets as well as opportunistic issuances in our capital markets investment products. While liability exposures grew, RIS PFOs were down 32% due to the mix of sales in the quarter, driven by lower structured settlement and income annuity sales.  
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 12% versus the prior year. The overall combined ratio was 91%, which was below our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 92.2%. P&C results benefited from favorable non-catastrophe weather in homeowners and auto. P&C auto also benefited from lower auto frequency over the last 2 weeks of the quarter due to the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders.  
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. Solid volume growth was driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis, which were up 7% and 9% on a constant currency basis. This was offset by less favorable underwriting margins, unfavorable equity markets in Japan and Korea, and lower investment margins.  
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 29% and down 19% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year driver was lower equity markets impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which was a negative 11% in the quarter versus a plus 5% return in 1Q of '19. Excluding the impact from encaje, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 23% on a constant currency basis due to higher investment margins, solid volume growth and favorable underwriting.  
EMEA adjusted earnings were down 9% and down 6% on a constant currency basis as lower equity markets and less favorable underwriting margins were partially offset by better expense margins and solid volume growth across the region.
Metlife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by adverse equity markets. The separate account return in the quarter was a negative 14.4%, which was better than the 20% decline in the S&P as roughly 30% of funds are allocated to fixed accounts. This resulted in a negative $20 million initial impact, which compares to an approximately $15 million positive initial impact in first quarter of '19.
With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 51%, which is near the bottom end of our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $138 million, excluding $55 million of UCI costs. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.5% and 20.2% on a run rate basis when adjusting for a favorable $45 million tax benefit in the quarter.  
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $351 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Our private equity portfolio, which is generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, had another solid quarter. With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.56% versus a roll-off rate of 3.92% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.15% in first quarter of '19. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship, but wider credit spreads in the quarter have provided an offset.  
Now on Page 6. The chart on Page 6 highlights our strong historical private equity returns. Steve Goulart presented a version of this slide at Investor Day showing private equity returns going back to 2016. Given the focus on our private equity in the current environment, we've decided to expand this view showing returns going back to the financial crisis in 2008. Our private equity portfolio was $7.6 billion as of March 31, which represents less than 2% of the general account assets under management. It is well diversified across strategy, geography and portfolio managers and provides a good fit against long-term liabilities. As you can see from the chart, our private equity investments have generated an average return of 12% since 2008. And only in 2009, the trough of the financial crisis, that this portfolio failed to generate a positive return.
These next 2 slides are shown -- were shown at our Investor Day, but they are helpful reminders. On Page 7, you can see our portfolio loss history since 2008. The chart highlights a strong track record of performance as our cumulative impairment rate of 1.2% is roughly half that of the industry peer group. It also speaks to MetLife Investment Management's culture of disciplined underwriting, deep fundamental analysis and strong risk management, with a particular focus on private asset origination.  
Turning to Page 8. As we've discussed previously, we have been proactive in improving the quality of our portfolio, with a focus on significantly reducing our exposure to below-investment-grade credit and syndicated bank loans. We're also highly focused on our low BBB exposure, given fallen angel risk. Our BBB- credit exposure is roughly 4% of the general account AUM and 46% of this is private placements, which benefit from better financial covenants in place.
I would also call to your attention Page 14 in the appendix, which displays that we have relatively modest fixed maturity exposures to stressed sectors. You can see our largest exposure on the chart is our energy portfolio of approximately $8.7 billion, of which 85% is investment grade. The energy portfolio is well diversified across subsectors and issuers. And we believe it is defensively positioned given the changes that we have made since the last downturn for the energy sector back in 2016.
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and first quarter of 2020. Through year-end 2019, we have achieved 170 basis points improvement in our direct expense ratio. And while we expect top line pressure in 2020, we remain committed to achieving our 12.3% full year target as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset, to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm.
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the second quarter given the uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10 with further detail offered by segment on Page 13 in the appendix.
Starting with investments. As Michel indicated, we anticipate the largest impact of the current environment to manifest in variable investment income with the return on our private equity portfolio. While we received a limited number of PE reports to date, our best estimate for the second quarter is a negative high-single to low double-digit return. In thinking about our recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure but reinvestment rates held reasonably steady during the first quarter as credit spreads widened to offset falling treasury rates and also provided good reinvestment opportunities.
During the last week of March, we were able to invest roughly $2 billion in high-quality investments that yielded on average 5.4%. Additionally, while interest rates remained low, the curve has steepened, which improves margins in our capital market products and RIS in our securities lending program.  
Moving on to underwriting margins. Broadly speaking, we anticipate modest underwriting impacts on a combined basis in the second quarter from COVID-19, but there are many moving parts. To date, while we've seen limited impact from COVID-19 on life claims in the U.S., we do expect this to increase during the second quarter. However, claims activity in dental has declined and auto claims frequency is down with fewer miles driven. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis in 2Q.
Turning to top line metrics. We would expect 2Q sales to be challenged in most of our markets with risk of further pressure in future quarters. Additionally, as Michel mentioned, for April and May, we've provided a 15% premium credit for MetLife personal auto customers and a 25% premium adjustment for our fully insured dental business within Group Benefits for the 2 months. As far as variable product sensitivities to equity markets, our Investor Day guidance offered back in December still holds.
While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, efficiency mindset continues to be a core tenet of our strategy in managing margin pressures across our business. And as I noted earlier, our plans include meeting our direct expense ratio full year target of 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment.
I will now discuss cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, which is up from $4.2 billion at December 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.1 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, preferred stock and debt issuances as well as holding company expenses.
During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million of net common shares with $485 million remaining on our current authorization. We have not been in the market since early March, which we believe to be prudent at this time. Our cash balances are high. Our next debt maturity is December 2022, and we like the optionality and financial flexibility those balances provide us at this time.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Using market inputs at the end of the first quarter, interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of March 31 and equity markets down 20% in 2020, we estimate that our average free cash flow ratio for the 2-year period, 2019 and 2020, will hold within our target range of 65% to 75%.
Looking forward to the 2-year period of 2020 to 2021 and assuming the same March 31, 2020, forward yield curves and a return to normal 5% equity market growth in 2021, we estimate our free cash flow would be within a range of 40% to 60%. This range occurs as we estimate some level of credit losses due to the pandemic over the next 12 to 24 months and some level of additional reserves would be established under current New York cash flow testing requirements, which would impact dividend capacity at our New York-domiciled statutory company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, or MLIC. We would not expect such reserves to be required under NAIC standards and, therefore, would not impact our combined NAIC RBC levels.
For our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2020 statutory operating losses were approximately $650 million and net income was approximately $260 million. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $1.9 billion from the prior year, primarily due to higher VA reserves. Net income was mostly driven by derivative gains in the quarter. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.4 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $2.8 billion from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Derivative gains more than offset operating losses in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 931% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter despite the significant volatility in the capital markets due to COVID-19. Looking ahead, we expect our second quarter adjusted earnings to be dampened by negative private equity returns, but our underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses to remain intact. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are resilient and well positioned to manage through this challenging environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

This is -- let's just be clear what our objective here is: To provide a scenario, we anchored it on some data or market data as of March 31. So it was really to provide a scenario of free cash flow. And one, we're considering a level of credit losses and downgrades based on our bottom-up analysis that our investment team has been working through and monitoring and thinking it will play out over a 12- to 24-month period. And two, looking at the potential impact of New York cash flow testing requirements using last year's requirements. And remember, we get a special consideration letter every year and then considering any new requirements that we're aware of. And so there, we applied those factors to estimate some level of cash flow testing reserves, again, based on March 31 macro factors. And as I said, Steve and team put forth a bottoms-up review to evaluate a range of credit losses. 
And for cash flow testing, we picked a point more stressful than where we are today, that being March 31, where interest rates -- while interest rates are similar, credit spreads were wider back then, equity markets were lower then. I would also point you to just directionally the shape of the curve is more favorable. Actually, it's more favorable than, I'd say, our year-end base case we used at the outlook call, just given the shape of the curve, given the significant drop in the short end. And then also, as I said, credit spreads, they're important as well in this, and they have narrowed since March 31. 
So I think it's important that -- to also know that we get this letter every year. The letter we -- the requirements were used from last year's letter was based on a different macroeconomic environment. So we're -- every year, we work through with New York in a constructive way, and we're cautiously optimistic we'll come to a reasonable place, but we wanted to give some sensitivity. And I think the other thing I would just add -- this is, I would say, consistent with the direction that we've given in the past, right? We've said that our free cash flow range of 65% to 75% holds with a 10-year treasury of 1.5% to 4.5%. And then as rates go below that, we would expect that to decline for a year or 2-year average, I should say. And I think that's kind of what we're trying to share here. 
And then LTC. So yes, look, I don't -- I'm not going to comment on someone else's situation. For us, we work with New York every year. So we -- I wouldn't say there's anything in particular for us. And we're always looking at our reserves, and there's nothing to point out different than what we've seen in every year."

There's no change in our philosophy, I would say, in terms of -- excess capital belongs to shareholders. We'd expect to distribute all free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for stress events. Also, if you think about our liquidity buffer, $3 billion to $4 billion, we're maintaining cash in excess of that, given the uncertain economic environment. And again, we believe that that's the prudent thing to do. So we're going to continue to evaluate the situation. We'll assess our liquidity position based on business and macro conditions. And we'll sort of -- we're in a -- I would say, we've hit the pause button for the time being, but we'll continue to monitor things and decide when would be an appropriate time to resume buybacks."

So again, a very secure, low-risk portfolio in our mind. 
Obviously, in this time, we are seeing elevated requests, as you'd expect, particularly in retail and hotels for forbearance requests. We have been getting requests. We have a committee that deals with each and every one. Certainly, we believe that some of these make sense to grant and that's what we've been doing. 90% of the requests have come from hotel and retail. And they're typically for deferral of interest and/or principal, and typically, what we've been granting is in the range of 3 to 4 months of forbearance. And remember, it's forbearance, not forgiveness. So we do expect that these will always be paid. And by the way, we saw virtually no impact on April payments for the portfolio overall.

And I would say, to date, on the short-term disability block, it's been a push. We've seen an increased number of COVID-related incidents but that's been more than offset in a decrease in other short-term disability claims, so think issues like elective surgeries and the like. So at this stage, while there's still some uncertainty, I mean, relating to the overall number of deaths in the U.S. and the impact on the insured population versus the general population, it's very reasonable to expect at this stage that the overall impact would more or less offset each other on a full year basis."

Let me start by just reminding everybody, I know you probably think I sound like a broken record when I do this, but we've been prepositioning this portfolio for a downturn since 2018. And that's been our outlook -- remember what we talked about at Investor Day, John updated some of those slides. But even going back to Investor Day, we've continued to reduce sectors that we were very concerned about: below investment grade, we reduced by another $600 million since Investor Day; bank loans, also another $600 million since Investor Day. And I think I would have to say, and I think anybody you talk to involved in investments, would say that we've entered this crisis period in better shape than we probably ever have in the past. So we're very comfortable moving into it. John showed a slide about sensitive sectors and the like. 
We've been analyzing the portfolio a number of different ways. We run it through a number of different tests and lenses. Frankly, many of you out there have actually conducted your own reviews. We actually go through every one of those in detail and just sort of compare to our own. We've done longer-term analyses using external models from the rating agencies and other outside experts. We've done a portfolio, kind of, top-down approach comparing the portfolio now to previous crises and downturns, emphasizing the sensitive exposures and how the portfolio has changed since those crises and imputing our historical default and loss experiences in those time periods. But John mentioned what we've actually spent the most time on is a real specific bottom-up individual exposure analysis by our credit and real estate research teams. Again, our core strength is in credit and structured underwriting, and we've been using them to really go through the portfolio to help us assess this. And the result is a very granular assessment of our exposures we think are vulnerable to downgrades and losses.
And in this analysis, particularly, we really thought of it in 2 ways. One is sort of a nearer-term recovery. Does the economy start opening up, say, sometime in the summer, into the summer? Or really, is it kind of a year-end scenario before the economy starts reopening? And the bottom-line assessment is based on what we foresee today. The impact of downgrades and possible losses on our capital in these scenarios is very manageable. That analysis put possible losses of up to $1.4 billion over time, as John said, likely to occur over kind of a 12- to 24-month period. And the impact on RBC from downgrades in that, we would estimate also up to about 25 basis points as well. 
So what I'd say, again, is we've been preparing for this. In this environment, we expect losses and downgrades above normal. But based on the prepositioning we've done and based on what we now today, we feel very comfortable and think our position is very sound."

And we'll expect, given VII returns in Q2 that this will take our overall spread down and -- in Q2. And just as a frame of reference for VII, 85% to 90% of our VII comes through 3 segments: it's RIS, MLH and Asia, and it's roughly 1/3 each. 
But let me focus on how the shape of the curve is improving spreads ex VII. And again, I think this highlights some of the diversification that we have in our business products and the tools that we have to deploy in different environments. And so we think for the remainder of this year, we would expect kind of 5 to 10 basis points improvement as a result of the -- how the curve has changed, particularly even since March. I mean if you just look at LIBOR, I think it's down 100 basis points since the end of the first quarter. 
And then maybe just to give you a quick update then on sensitivities because I know we gave those to you back at the outlook call. So now where LIBOR is, which is below 50 basis points, our sensitivity would be for every 10 bps move, it would be $10 million plus or minus, depending on whether it goes up or down. The long-term sensitivity doesn't change but the near term one does. So it almost doubles. So anyway, I thought I'd just provide that color as well."

Let me just maybe start by profiling the overall PFO mix and then talk about some of the dynamics coming out of that. So remember, 75% of our PFOs are coming from national accounts, so think large employers. And when you think about the headline unemployment numbers there that you're seeing in the economy, those have really disproportionately impact smaller employers, part-time workers and the like. And the other dynamic in our national accounts book that's important is that the ultimate impact that we would actually see is going to be also influenced by the benefit practices of certain large employers. So you've seen examples where employers have continued to provide benefits for furloughed workers. So that's kind of one just triangulation point for you. 
The other piece, when you think about top line for this business is that we have a diversified book by industry and geography. And just like what we do in the credit portfolio, we've done the same thing here in terms of looking at industries, which are most at risk in terms of unemployment levels and benefits being cut. And that percentage is just shy of 10% of our entire book. So as an example, hotels and leisure is less than 2%.
So you put all of that together, you put the fact that we're getting strong persistency above our expectations, we're getting good renewal actions at expectations. You put all of that together, we'll see some headwinds to PFOs related to overall unemployment. But I would say we would still see some PFO growth for the full year, albeit modest and likely shy of the 4% to 6% range that we've talked about, but nevertheless, we will see growth.
Two other points just to bear in mind as you think about the timing. We have implemented a premium credit in our dental business for the months of April and May, given the significant drop in utilization of dental services. And we will align the dental premiums for the balance of 2020 with the expected utilization of services. So when you think about our Q2 number, we will be shifting some revenue recognition from Q2 to the second half of the year. And the second point to highlight here, again, in the context of $1 billion or so voluntary business that we talked about on our Investor Day, we talked about a 30% CAGR in that business, historically. We're still expecting for 2020 to still see double-digit CAGR in PFOs for voluntary. And while unemployment levels are a headwind, we have tailwinds here. We have increased awareness of the needs of -- for this product, and we're starting from a place where there's relatively low penetration of these products with the employee population."

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally.

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we set the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event. And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generate strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a one quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife. We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims of selling longevity impact and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. Our group benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our group life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect group life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, with deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19. 
Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate an uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination and not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment, but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits. 
Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and for a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer. We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our next Horizon strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. Another growth opportunity is the need of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice. We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail."

I'll start with the 2Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our outlook for the third quarter as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, were $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in Variable Investment Income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more details shortly. In regards to the top line, Group benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter. Group benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOS, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income booty sales. Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter. This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean and Kahe returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19 related claims. The Life Interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect corporate and other losses to be between $325 in the second half of the year. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and corporate and other. 
In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and corporate and other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and corporate and other to have less as compared to the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend results. 
Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the [ 20th ] earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve recognition with the availability of dental service sources. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 2 quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for needs of the firm. Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10. Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis. Assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate. With life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q. 
Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid- single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. 
Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test a MetLife significantly reduced risk profile. I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

Yet having said that, over the past 3 months, we've seen a resilient equity market and tighter credit spreads, as you reference, government and Fed reserve policy. And our cash position has grown to $6.6 million, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on plus for the time being. So I hope that answers your question."

So things, as Michel said, there has been a somewhat resilient equity and credit market for the last 3 months. I'd still say we're in the mode of caution at this point in terms of what the outlook it will be and how this will play out. I also talked about last time that, that factors in some level of cash flow testing. It's a range of outcomes. And that some -- the estimates we provided were based on New York special consideration letter that we receive every year.

But we wanted to just give a I'll say, a stress set of scenarios for what's a possible outcome. But it's -- I wouldn't call it a guide.

And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments. In June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period."

So as you mentioned, we do believe that driving an efficiency mindset. And then just keep in mind, coming off our UCI initiative, where we've exceeded our target is very important, and the management team here is highly committed to this. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation. So again, I cannot stress enough. In times of crisis, it's about the things that you control. And that's one area that we feel we do control. And as I said, we're very committed to maintain the 12.3% despite all the other things that I mentioned earlier."

And most of that is driven by the drop in LIBOR. This has helped us a little -- be resilient when it comes to our spreads, the shape of the curve against some headwinds. Lower rates do hurt ultimately, but the shape of the curve matters a lot, as we've said before. We also have seen some head, in particular around hotels. So -- but nonetheless, I think the spreads have been resilient. We expect them to VII, where the shape of the curve would help offset some of those other headwinds."

And John made some comments on this, too, and then I'll pick up. But we're still dealing crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tone have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. The risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved. And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this."

More broadly, with respect to PFO growth in the third quarter, we did talk about employment levels being one of the key drivers that drives PFO here for the group benefits business. If you recall, we talked about a number of attributes on the last call, which somewhat mitigate that employment level impact in terms of the diversification of our book, the focus towards more larger accounts, national accounts, so in aggregate, if you think about the third quarter, we are still looking at PFO growth in the solid mid digits for group benefits."

Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view. Of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michelle mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3 end of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis basis to still be the case even with death rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. And just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe a segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both R and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3."

The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event. And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generates strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. 
In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a one quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion (sic) [$500 million] investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife. We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims offsetting longevity impacts and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. 
Our Group Benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our Group Life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect Group Life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, we've deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. 
Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19. 
Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate in uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. 
Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination in not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment, but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. 
Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits. 
Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and file a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. 
For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 
12.2%. 
An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer. We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our Next Horizon Strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. 
Another growth opportunity is the new suite of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. 
Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice. We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail."

Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, was $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in variable investment income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. 
Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
In regards to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers in April and May, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter, Group Benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income annuity sales. 
Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19 related claims. The Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the primary driver for the higher loss in the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect Corporate & Other losses to be between $325 million to $375 million in the second half of the year. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and Corporate & Other. 
In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and Corporate & Other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and Corporate & Other to have less as compared to the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend VII impact on the second quarter results. 
Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 25% dental premium credit referenced earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve to appropriately align dental revenue recognition with the availability of dental services. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 2 quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. 
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10. Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. 
Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. 
Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. 
Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis, assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate, with life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q. 
Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. 
Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test at MetLife significantly reduce the risk profile. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. 
Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. 
Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments in June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period."

And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation.

But we're still dealing with essentially an unprecedented crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, the Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tones have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections; however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. And therefore, the risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved. And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise, in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this."

Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michel mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3, we think the overall trend of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with deaths rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. I'd also highlight in LATAM again just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe high single to low double digit impact on the segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both RIS and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3."

The pet insurance market, if you look at it more broadly, 2/3 of Americans have a pet. They spend collectively $18 billion every year on vet care. But the penetration in the market is -- in the insurance market is just 2%. And it's seeing 20% CAGR year-on-year. And clearly, look, the -- we have -- we've purchased a company with immense data and history. We have our best actuaries working on this, and we're very much confident in our underwriting in this line of business going forward."

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally.

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we said the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event. And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generates strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. 
In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a 1-quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion (sic) [ $500 million ] investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife. We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims offsetting longevity impacts and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. 
Our Group Benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our Group Life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect Group Life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, we've deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. 
Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19. 
Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate in uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. 
Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination in not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. 
Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits. 
Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and file a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. 
An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer. We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our Next Horizon Strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first-ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. 
Another growth opportunity is the new suite of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. 
Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice. We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail."

In addition, the slides provides more detail on our outlook for the third quarter as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, was $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in variable investment income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. 
Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
In regards to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers in April and May, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter, Group Benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income annuity sales. 
Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19-related claims. The Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the primary driver for the higher loss in the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect Corporate & Other losses to be between $325 million to $375 million in the second half of the year. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and Corporate & Other. 
In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and Corporate & Other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and Corporate & Other to have less as compared to the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend VII impact on the second quarter results. 
Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 25% dental premium credit referenced earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve to appropriately align dental revenue recognition with the availability of dental services. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 2 quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. 
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10. Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single-digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. 
Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. 
Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. 
Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis, assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate, with life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q. 
Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. 
Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test at MetLife significantly reduce the risk profile. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. 
Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. 
Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And we felt that it was prudent to build our cash and capital and to maintain --  in order to maintain financial flexibility. Our view is that there remains substantial uncertainty in the economy as well as with the pandemic, which is going to take more time to clear. Yet having said that, over the past 3 months, we've seen a resilient equity market and tighter credit spreads, as you referenced, both beneficiaries of government and Fed reserve policy. And our cash position has grown to $6.6 billion, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on pause for the time being. So I hope that answers your question."

And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments in June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period."

If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation.

But we're still dealing with essentially an unprecedented crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, the Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tones have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections; however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. And therefore, the risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved. And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise, in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset/liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this."

And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3, we think the overall trend of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with deaths rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. I'd also highlight in LATAM again just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe high single to low double-digit impact on the segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both RIS and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3."

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally.

My focus this morning will be on how MetLife is successfully managing through the current crisis, financially, operationally and culturally. I'll begin with our financial performance in the second quarter, which demonstrates 3 key fundamentals about our business. First, we have become a simpler and more predictable company. On our last earnings call, we said the major pandemic related impact in the second quarter would be the loss in our private equity portfolio. The negative 8.2% return we reported fell squarely within the range provided. Second, our businesses are well diversified by both geography and product, providing meaningful offsets to increased claims from COVID-19. In aggregate, the second quarter was not an underwriting event. And third, we remain a company that is committed to and generates strong free cash flow, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility. 
In the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $758 million or $0.83 per share compared to $1.38 per share a year ago. Net income of $68 million fell below adjusted earnings primarily due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against declining equity markets. On a 2020 year-to-date basis, MetLife has generated $4.4 billion of net income. As you know, our private equity portfolio is reported on a 1-quarter lag, so the results reflect the extremely difficult first quarter equity market. The percentage decline in our private equity portfolio was much smaller than the 20% drop in the S&P 500, but still generated an after-tax quarterly loss of $0.48 per share, consistent with the expectations we shared with you. Given the substantial rebound in the equity market, we expect a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio when we next report our quarterly results. Our roughly $500 billion (sic) [ $500 million ] investment portfolio remains a key strength for MetLife. We believe the diversity, quality and liquidity of our portfolio as well as our early actions to reduce risk position us well for a variety of market outcomes. Year-to-date, we have seen only modest realized investment losses. Our underwriting results in the quarter reflect the broad diversity of our businesses. For example, higher claims frequencies in the U.S. were largely balanced by fewer auto insurance claims offsetting longevity impacts and lower claims and utilization of other protection products globally. 
Our Group Benefits business is instructive. Higher mortality drove our Group Life benefit ratio beyond our annual target range, but this was offset in part by a decrease in dental utilization. Looking ahead, we expect Group Life mortality to improve but remain elevated in the third quarter. And while dental utilization should increase as we move through the year, we've deferred recognition of dental premium given the significant decrease in the availability of dental services. This has the effect of limiting outsized results in any one quarter. 
Overall, we continue to expect that the diversity of our business mix will mitigate the global underwriting impact of COVID-19. 
Turning to free cash flow. We have long spoken of a life insurers capacity to generate cash as one of the most critical measures of the strength and sustainability of its business model. In the second quarter, we were able to grow total cash and liquid assets at our holding companies to $6.6 billion. This is up from $5.3 billion sequentially and well above our cash buffer target of $3 billion to $4 billion. Our strong cash reserves provide us with significant financial flexibility to navigate in uncertain and changing economic landscape, including taking advantage of opportunities as well as managing potential impacts to our investment portfolio. 
Beyond our financial results, I would like to spend a few minutes on other ways we are managing the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operationally, our people continue to show grit and determination in not only stepping up to respond effectively to a challenging environment but in accelerating some of the trends that will be critical to our long-term success. 
Enterprise-wide, 75% of our employees continue to work remotely. Throughout the crisis, we have been able to deliver for our customers without interruption. In our U.S. group business, for example, we continue to meet or exceed our service level agreements. The crisis is also causing us to fast forward the digitization of our company, which will produce lasting benefits. 
Turning to the U.S. Group business again. We have expedited and now completed the rollout of an enhanced digital platform that makes it easier for customers to get benefit information, make payments and file a claim. Since the start of the year, the number of people eligible to access the platform has grown by more than 30 million. In addition to continuing to invest to improve the customer experience, we also provided our customers with significant premium relief in the second quarter. While this created some top line pressure, we remain committed to strong expense discipline. We moved quickly to find savings as part of our efficiency mindset and are still on track to achieve our full year direct expense ratio target of 12.3%. For the first 6 months of the year, the ratio is 12.2%. 
An essential part of being a high-performing company is having a strong culture and here, too, we are seeing improvements. One of the biggest concerns about the shift to working from home was that employee engagement would suffer. We have been experiencing the opposite effect. In all 3 of our priority areas, collaboration across the enterprise, a strong focus on the customer and a spirit of experimentation, employee engagement has actually strengthened. Part of this is the deep sense of purpose that our employees feel at a time when what we do matters more than ever. Another factor is our commitment as a leadership team to communicating at unprecedented levels. For example, we have been holding interactive global town halls for all of our employees every other week. Our commitment to building momentum for our Next Horizon Strategy has a new urgency as well. More than 25,000 employees have participated in immersive virtual sessions to build a strong sense of ownership. The pillars of our strategy remain more relevant than ever, focus on deploying scarce capital to its highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
Far from slowing us down, the current crisis is accelerating our efforts to find attractive opportunities. In June, we closed our first-ever deal in the U.K. longevity reinsurance market. Longevity risk is a business that allows us to tap several competitive advantages, including our world-class actuarial talent. In addition, the underwriting and capital dynamics of this business fit well with our internal rate of return and payback period requirements. 
Another growth opportunity is the new suite of products we are adding to our market-leading employee benefits platform. In January, we closed on the acquisition of PetFirst to give us access to the fast-growing pet insurance market. Even though we will not launch the product on our platform until later this year, 25 large employers with approximately 250,000 eligible employees have already signed up to offer pet insurance as a voluntary benefit. 
Before I close, I would like to say a word about MetLife's commitment to diversity and inclusion, a topic that has taken on greater importance in light of recent protests across the United States. MetLife has taken a number of steps to contribute to a more just and equitable society. We have spoken out in the face of injustice. We have committed to improving diversity within our own workforce, and we have contributed financially to organizations that advance rational equity. While we know there is more work to do, both as a company and as a society, our purpose is motivating us to help make forward progress. What I hope you will take away from today's call is that MetLife feels a tremendous sense of urgency about the future. Everyone has heard the expression, don't let a crisis go to waste. At MetLife, we are taking that to heart and doing the work now to position ourselves for long-term success. We're becoming more efficient. We're gaining new customer insights. We're strengthening our culture and we're remaining laser-focused on consistent execution. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our second quarter results in greater detail."

Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $68 million, was $690 million lower than adjusted earnings of $758 million. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the stronger equity markets as well as higher long-term interest rates in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $4.4 billion compared to net income of $3 billion in the first half of 2019. The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. Also, as highlighted on Page 3, adjusted earnings included a $438 million after-tax loss in variable investment income, or VII. I will provide more details on this shortly. 
On Page 4, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding total notable items. This quarter's results did not include any notable items, while the prior year quarter had $70 million associated with our recently completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in Corporate & Other. Excluding the UCI cost in the second quarter of '19, adjusted earnings were down 45% and down 44% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were down 43% and down 41% on a constant currency basis. Overall, Variable Investment Income was lower than second quarter of '19 by $702 million after tax. This decline in VII was more than the decline in total adjusted earnings year-over-year. 
Positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable expense margins and equity market strength in the quarter. This was partially offset by the lower recurring interest margins and less favorable taxes compared to 2Q of '19. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were down 20% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 95.9% due to elevated claims related to COVID-19. This is above our annual target range of 85% to 90% and less favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.3%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 58.5%, which is well below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter ratio of 75.4%. The primary driver was extremely low dental utilization, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. 
In regards to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower dental premiums from the deferral of revenues given a significant decrease in the availability of dental services and to account for a 25% premium credit to all fully insured customers in April and May, excluding these dental premium adjustments, which totaled approximately $500 million in the quarter, Group Benefits PFOs would have been within its annual target range due to solid growth across all markets. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 45% year-over-year due to unfavorable investment margins related to the decline in variable investment income, which was partially offset by favorable underwriting margins. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 25 basis points, down 94 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 85 basis points in the quarter, up 1 basis point year-over-year due to a decline in LIBOR rates. RIS liability exposures grew 11% year-over-year, driven by strong volume across all products and separate account investment performance in the quarter. While liability exposures grew RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 22% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income annuity sales. 
Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings were up 19% versus the prior year period, driven by favorable underwriting margins, partially offset by unfavorable investment margins related to variable investment income. The overall combined ratio was 91.1%, which was more favorable than our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter ratio of 96.1%. P&C results benefited from lower auto claim frequencies due to a decline in miles driven in the quarter This was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses of $89 million after-tax compared to $62 million after tax in 2Q of '19. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were down 29% and 27% on a constant currency basis due to lower investment margins resulting primarily from the decline in variable investment income in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid volume growth, which was driven by a 5% increase in general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis as well as favorable expense margins. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 17% as foreign exchange rates across the region dampened year-over-year results. If today's FX rates hold, we would expect the year-over-year impact to Latin America's third quarter earnings to be similar to the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 3%, driven by higher equity markets, favorably impacting our Chilean encaje returns, which were up 14% in the quarter as well as favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by unfavorable investment margins. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 51% and 59% on a constant currency basis. This was a record adjusted earnings quarter for EMEA, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims in group Medical and accident and health policies in the region as well as better expense margins. We would expect EMEA's underwriting results to be closer to historical levels in the third quarter. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down $279 million year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by lower variable investment income of $250 million after-tax, compared to the prior year. As well as lower recurring interest margins and unfavorable underwriting due to COVID-19-related claims. The Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 59.1% and which was above the prior year quarter of 53.9% and above our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Higher equity markets in the quarter were a partial offset to the year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings. The separate account return in the quarter was 14.8%, which resulted in a positive $13 million initial impact, which compares to a positive $5 million initial impact in 2Q '19. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $289 million. This result was less favorable to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $237 million, excluding $70 million of UCI costs. The decline in variable investment income was the primary driver for the higher loss in the quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect Corporate & Other losses to be between $325 million to $375 million in the second half of the year. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 19.2%, modestly below our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now let's turn to Page 5. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including a loss of $555 million in the second quarter of 2020. The loss was entirely attributable to the private equity portfolio which had a negative 8.2% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, and the negative marks included in our 2Q '20 financial results are in line with our disclosures from the last earnings call. 
With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.41% versus a roll-off rate of 3.72% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.01% and a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q '19. We have added a table on Page 6 that breaks out the second quarter negative VII of $438 million after-tax by segment. The largest VII impacts to adjusted earnings in the quarter were MetLife Holdings and Retirement and Income Solutions, followed by Asia and Corporate & Other. 
In the quarter, certain timing adjustments have shifted the relative VII impact between Asia and Corporate & Other. Going forward, these timing adjustments will be eliminated and as such, we would expect Asia's adjusted earnings to have a larger contribution from VII and Corporate & Other to have less as compared to the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to Page 7. This chart provides one approach to illustrate the impact of below trend VII on our reported earnings. The box in red reflects the adjusted EPS impact of $0.48 related to the negative VII experienced in the quarter. This was the first quarterly loss for VII since 2009. The $0.22 highlighted in the green box illustrates the adjusted EPS impact assuming VII at the quarterly midpoint of our 2020 annual target range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. To be clear, this chart should not be viewed as quarterly guidance, but rather as one approach to illustrate the below trend VII impact on the second quarter results. 
Moving to Page 8. This walk provides more detail on the group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio. As I noted earlier, the reported ratio of 58.5% was very favorable, driven by low dental utilization. However, 2 adjustments are needed for comparability to our annual target guidance of 72% to 77% and the sensitivities we provided on our outlook call last December. First, the ratio should be adjusted by 3.9 points for the 25% dental premium credit referenced earlier. Second, the ratio should also be adjusted by 7.1 points related to the establishment of an unearned premium reserve. We established an unearned premium reserve to appropriately align dental revenue recognition with the availability of dental services. As dental offices have begun to open across the U.S., we have seen utilization pick up in July for more involved treatments and procedures, which represent less than 20% of our typical overall dental claims. However, incidence remains low for more routine visits. We expect dental utilization to pick up in the second half of the year, pushing the ratio closer to the low end of our 72% to 77% target range. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 2 quarters of 2020. In 2020, our year-to-date direct expense ratio was 12.2%, while the ratio was elevated in 2Q at 12.4% due to top line pressure from premium credits in our dental and auto businesses, as well as the establishment of a dental premium reserve. We remain on track and committed to achieving our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. 
Now I'd like to spend some time reviewing several key considerations for the third quarter, given the continued uncertainty of the current environment. These considerations are summarized on Page 10. Starting with investments. We expect a strong recovery in variable investment income in the third quarter with our best estimate for private equity returns to be a positive mid-single-digit, which is based on a $7.2 billion PE balance at June 30. 
Regarding recurring investment income, we continue to experience downward pressure from lower rates. However, reinvestment rates have held up reasonably well during the first half of the year, given our diverse market-leading asset origination capabilities. 
Finally, we expect the short end of the yield curve to remain favorable, supporting investment spreads. 
Moving on to underwriting margins. We continue to anticipate modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19 on a combined basis, assuming deaths rise in the U.S. to approximately 200,000 through the third quarter. We expect life insurance claims frequency in the U.S. to moderate, with life insurance benefit ratios and group benefits and MetLife Holdings moving closer to their respective annual target ranges. However, we do expect claims activity to significantly increase in Latin America in the third quarter, as the region is behind other parts of the world in COVID-19 emergence. Additionally, we would expect some level of offsets from businesses with longevity risks, most notably in Retirement and Income Solutions. So currently, we expect a limited overall impact to underwriting margins on a combined basis for 3Q. 
Turning to top line metrics, we would expect global face-to-face sales to remain challenged, negatively impacting most of our segments. However, we do anticipate modest sequential sales improvement in Japan. We expect lower adjusted PFOs in most segments with the exception of group benefits, which we expect to have mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. While we expect to encounter volume and top line growth pressures, our efficiency mindset is a core tenet of our strategy to manage margin pressures across our business. As I noted earlier, we remain on track to meet our direct expense ratio full year target of approximately 12.3% despite the challenges of the current environment. 
Now let's turn to Page 11. Given the persistent low interest rate environment, we decided to add this page on estimated impacts to our income statement and balance sheet. If we were to lower our long-term actuarial U.S. interest rate assumption of 3.75% by 25, 50, 100 or 150 basis points. For each hypothetical scenario, GAAP loss recognition is not triggered, and there would be a relatively modest impact to net income, specifically, with respect to the 150 basis point down scenario, which would bring our long-term mean reversion rate assumption to 2.25%. I would highlight 2 points. First, the approximate $425 million net income impact is consistent with the guidance range disclosed on our 1Q '20 earnings call. And second, we will continue to have a significant margin for purposes of GAAP loss recognition. Overall, I believe these sensitivities of test at MetLife significantly reduce the risk profile. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 12. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.6 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.3 billion at March 31 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.3 billion increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends payment of our common stock dividend as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our combined NAIC RBC ratio was 395% at year-end 2019 and comfortably above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.8 billion, while net income was approximately $2.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by approximately $600 million from the first half of 2019, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by lower operating expenses. 
Year-to-date net income was driven by derivative gains, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Our expected total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21.1 billion as of June 30, up 13% compared to December 31, 2019. Derivative gains and operating income more than offset dividends paid and other investment losses. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 799% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. In summary, this quarter's adjusted earnings were dampened by the negative private equity returns which are based on a one quarter accounting lag. However, the underlying business fundamentals from our diverse market-leading businesses were evident in our results despite the challenging environment. 
Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings to benefit from a strong recovery in private equity returns, while continuing to absorb modest underwriting impacts from COVID-19. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through this unprecedented environment. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And our cash position has grown to $6.6 billion, which gives us greater financial flexibility and optionality. So if you take all of these factors together, we would not roll out capital management in the latter part of 20 but we remain on pause for the time being. So I hope that answers your question."

And again, we continue to believe it's very conservatively positioned. The average loan-to-value is 57%. And the average debt service coverage ratio on the portfolio is 2.4x. It's very well diversified geographically and by property type. And we also feel it's concentrated in high-quality assets that are typically located in larger primary markets. So again, backdrop of a very strong fundamentally built diversified portfolio. That said, there clearly are signs of stress in sectors like hotel and retail. For us, that's less than 25% of the total. And not surprisingly, as I talked about on the previous earnings call, we have received requests for temporary debt service payment deferrals on the portfolio. We've reached a point where we're really not seeing much in the way of new requests, but we've granted about 9% on a principal balance outstanding of those. And again, they're heavily concentrated in hotel and retail. But again, these are payment deferrals. We don't expect losses, and we're not projecting losses from any of those today. It's just they're going to be delayed in receiving the principal and interest. And in addition to just those that we've granted deferrals on, we actually have received 100% of all other expected payments in June. So this is something we'll deal with in this crisis. But again, given our long-term history of performance in commercial mortgages, and I'll remind you, from 2009 to '19, we have less than $120 million in cumulative losses, the portfolio, we believe, is well positioned, and we'll manage through this time period."

And then just keep in mind, coming off our UCI initiative, where we've exceeded our target is very important, and the management team here is highly committed to this. And if anything, we're seeing an acceleration of this during the pandemic. If you consider that we do have some incremental costs related to the pandemic that we are managing to offset. If you take into account the fact that this quarter, we have about $500 million. Our top line is suppressed by about $500 million due to the dental credits and the UPR that we discussed earlier. We're seeing also some top line pressure just from the pandemic in general, yet we continue to be committed to our 12.3% expense ratio. I think that gives you a sense of just the urgency and the momentum that we're seeing in terms of the adoption of this efficiency mindset. And clearly, as we see further adoption of some of our digital tools, we think those trends are going to persist even coming out of this crisis as we continue to find ways of further simplifying the company. We feel good about sort of what we discussed during Investor Day about our ability to create additional capacity. That's also going to help us continue to invest in growth and innovation. So again, I cannot stress enough. In times of crisis, it's about the things that you control. And that's one area that we feel we do control.

But we're still dealing with essentially an unprecedented crisis in the markets. And in our mind, that's presented a fair amount of uncertainty around what the shape of the recovery would look like. And what long-term impacts could be. Now we all know, the Fed came to the rescue and through really unprecedented intervention has calmed the markets. And in general, the market tones have certainly improved where we were a quarter ago. And when you look at things like a lot of the downgrade projections that were in the market, just about all those participants have reduced their projections; however, we are still seeing defaults and bankruptcies, and that trend is going to continue. If you think back to our first quarter call, we talked about how we are looking at that, different scenarios and analyses we've made and what the potential impact would be on our portfolio and on our risk-based capital, and what we said was through all the analysis we've done, we think that all the risks are manageable. So put that in the context of today, things have improved. And therefore, the risk that we saw a quarter ago have also modestly improved. And therefore, I guess, I'd describe it as continuing to be very manageable. But all that said, we are still very cautious about the market because there is a disconnect, we think, between kind of technicals and fundamentals. So we continue to be cautious. We've continued to reposition the portfolio. When we see price and spread action like we've seen in some sectors and names that we are still cautious about, we're going to continue and have continued to reduce our exposure. At the same time, though, there are attractive opportunities, and we're going to take advantage of them when we can. Particularly we've seen over the last quarter, continued opportunities in private assets, and so we'll continue to invest there. So again, it's really one of balance about continuing to take advantage of what the market will give us to lighten up the portfolio in those sectors and names that we are so cautious about. But taking advantage of opportunities that we see, which, again, right now seem to be more heavily concentrated, again, no surprise, in private assets, which, again, given our strong origination networks, our reputation of commitment to those sectors and our conservative underwriting really serve us well. And I think that's when you just look at our commitment to sound underwriting to asset/liability management, and most importantly, to diversification across the portfolio that allows us to really continue to put up a long term positive, successful investing track record even in markets like this."

This additional catch-up effect will be offset by the release of the unearned premium reserve in the subsequent quarters. So we will get -- we will see that UPR, if you will, release into premiums as we see that catch-up effect happen with respect to utilization. More broadly, with respect to PFO growth in the third quarter, we did talk about employment levels being one of the key drivers that drives PFO here for the group benefits business. If you recall, we talked about a number of attributes on the last call, which somewhat mitigate that employment level impact in terms of the diversification of our book, the focus towards more larger accounts, national accounts, so in aggregate, if you think about the third quarter, we are still looking at PFO growth in the solid mid digits for group benefits."

Look, I would probably put this in the context of just overall view of underwriting. So just as a reminder as to what Michel mentioned, overall, for 2Q, we saw a modest impact in underwriting on a combined basis. We had higher claims in the U.S., and they were largely offset by auto claims, auto frequency claims. Also, we had some longevity impacts in the quarter. And then we had other claims and utilization benefits outside the U.S., particularly EMEA. As we look into the Q3, we think the overall trend of kind of a neutral impact on underwriting on a combined basis to still be the case even with deaths rising to 200,000 in the U.S. So a couple of things to highlight. We expect the mortality, as I said before, on my opening remarks for Group Life and MetLife Holdings to still be elevated, albeit migrating closer to the top end of our range. So not as severe as 2Q. I'd also highlight in LATAM again just particularly in Mexico, we expect COVID impact to rise in Q3. So we're forecasting about 40,000 deaths in Q3 for Mexico. And at this point, we'd estimate that would have roughly maybe high single to low double-digit impact on the segment benefit ratio. And then going to your point around offsetting impacts. So offsetting these elevated losses, we do expect longevity offsets to increase in both RIS and long-term care as these typically are delayed by a quarter or are slower to emerge from a reporting perspective. And then as I said in my remarks, we also expect EMEA would migrate back to normal trends. So in summary, we think the net underwriting result would generally offset, and therefore, COVID impacts would remain modest in Q3."

I'm pleased to be speaking with you from MetLife's headquarters in New York City, where I'll discuss our results for the third quarter of 2020. 
MetLife delivered a strong third quarter, driven by variable investment income, balanced underwriting and expense discipline. 
Third quarter net income was $633 million compared to net income of $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019. The decline is primarily a result of mark-to-mark losses on derivatives that hedge our liabilities. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $5.1 billion compared to net income of $5.2 billion a year ago. Adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion, up 33%, and up 35% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were $1.73, up 36% from the prior year period. 
During the third quarter, MetLife conducted its annual global review of actual assumptions underlying the estimate of certain insurance assets and liabilities. Actual assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. Primary driver was the change in our long-term interest rate assumption. We reduced the rate by 100 basis points to 2.75% over 12 years. 
Now let's turn to our business results. 
Starting with the U.S. Adjusted earnings were $900 million, up 27%, driven by an increase in variable investment income and volume growth. Group benefits adjusted earnings were $392 million, up 7%, driven by volume growth. Underwriting was mixed, with favorable results in non-medical health, largely offset by higher mortality. 
In Retirement and Income Solutions, adjusted earnings were $490 million, up 73%, driven by favorable investment margins, including increased variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting and volume growth. 
In Property and Casualty, adjusted earnings were $18 million, down 68%, driven by the highest catastrophe losses in nearly a decade. 
In our non-U.S. segments, Asia adjusted earnings were up 33% and up 31% on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable lines in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 34% and up 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting, expense margins and volume growth. Adjusted earnings in Latin America were down 75% and down 71% on a constant currency basis. Excluding notable lines from both periods, adjusted earnings were down 67% and down 62% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by unfavorable COVID-related underwriting and lower Chilean and Kihei returns. 
In EMEA, adjusted earnings were down 2%, while on a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings were up 2%. Excluding notable lines from both periods, adjusted earnings were up 26% and up 30% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable underwriting, expense margins and volume growth. 
And finally, in MetLife Holdings, which contains the closed block businesses from our former U.S. retail segment, adjusted earnings were up 70%. Excluding notable lines from both periods, adjusted earnings were up 35%, driven by an increase in variable investment income and favorable long-term care underwriting. 
Further details regarding the performance of our business segments can be found in our earnings release dated November 4. 
Looking at some key ratios. MetLife's adjusted return on equity was 13.2%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. Book value per common share was $53.10, up 9% from a year ago. 
Turning to cash and capital management. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies was approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. In the third quarter, we resumed share repurchases and bought back $80 million of our common stock. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Versant Health in an all-cash deal totaling $1.7 billion. We paid over $400 million in common stock dividends in the quarter. And our Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2020 common stock dividend of $0.46 per share. All these actions reflect the ongoing confidence we have in our financial strength. 
In the face of what remains a highly uncertain environment, MetLife continues to perform well. We remain focused on and committed to consistent execution. And we are a simpler company with the right mix of differentiated businesses.

We are simpl",1612,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpler and more predictable. 
For example, the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review was modest and consistent with the sensitivities we provided last quarter. We have a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses. That diversity was on display and the largely offsetting impact of COVID-19. And we have an ongoing commitment to consistent execution. A good quarter at MetLife is just another installment in what investors have come to expect of us and what we expect of ourselves. 
Turning to the numbers. We reported third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.73 per share compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Net income of $633 million was below adjusted earnings, mostly due to losses on derivatives, helped to protect our balance sheet against movements in equity markets and interest rates. 
For year-to-date 2020, MetLife has generated $5.1 billion of net income. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $1.95 per share compared to $1.4 billion or $1.54 per share a year ago. The only notable item in the quarter was our annual actuarial assumption review, which had a negative $203 million impact on adjusted earnings and an incremental negative $98 million impact on net income. 
This is largely a function of lowering our long-term interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. As expected, we experienced a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio, which we report on a 1 quarter lag. The rebound that occurred a 6.7% return, tracked with the mid-single-digit forecast we provided in Q2. 
Other contributors, including hedge funds and prepayments, added meaningfully to our $652 million of pretax variable investment income. Turning to some third quarter business highlights. Our U.S. business segment produced very strong adjusted earnings driven by Group Benefits and retirement and income solutions. 
In Group Benefits, group life mortality experience improved from the second quarter and dental utilization and disability remains favorable. RIS benefited from the rebound in VII as well as temporarily wider recurring investment spreads. Offsetting this, Property & Casualty saw heavier than normal catastrophe losses that overwhelmed favorable auto claims frequency. 
Outside the U.S., Asia's adjusted earnings ex notables were up 34% from a year ago on higher VII, favorable underwriting, lower expenses and volume growth. Adjusted earnings ex notables in Latin America were down 67% year-over-year as COVID claims rose sharply as expected. In EMEA, adjusted earnings ex notables increased 26% due to lower expenses, favorable underwriting and volume growth. 
And finally, for MetLife Holdings, adjusted earnings ex notables rose 35% on higher VII and better long-term care underwriting results. Our cash position strengthened during the quarter, ending at $7.8 billion, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The increase in cash is mostly due to our issuance of $1 billion of fixed preferred stock during the quarter, which was used in October to retire $1 billion of floating preferred stock. 
As we committed in September, we have resumed repurchases of our common stock, roughly $80 million in the third quarter and about another $240 million since then. Despite the extreme disruption 2020 has presented, we are on track this year to deploy $4.3 billion of capital towards strategic M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchases. 
We believe this underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and MetLife's consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. We rolled our Next Horizon strategy almost 1 year ago with 3 main pillars: focus on deploying scarce capital and resources to their highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience, and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
We believe we have made clear progress on all 3 fronts. At Investor Day last December, I noted that our capital management philosophy at MetLife has not changed. Capital is precious, and we are disciplined in deploying it to the highest value opportunities. Our purchase of Versant Health, which we expect to close before year-end, demonstrates our commitment to this approach. Vision Care is a capital-light business with strong risk-adjusted returns and high free cash flow generation, like our U.S. group benefits franchise more broadly, it is precisely the kind of business we want to grow. 
Knowing where not to play is just as important as knowing where to place our strategic bets. During the quarter, we booked the sale of our annuity business in Argentina, which was no longer the right fit for MetLife. While not material to MetLife, this divestment helps illustrate our ongoing process of planting and pruning in an effort to achieve the optimal business mix. 
When we talk about simplifying MetLife, we have 2 goals in mind: continuously improving our operational efficiency and becoming an easier company for our customers to do business with. On efficiency, given the headwinds we have faced this year, we knew it was going to be a challenge to meet our target of a 12.3% direct expense ratio, but this is a firm commitment, and we will keep it. 
Despite higher anticipated seasonal expenses in Q4, we are increasingly confident that we will beat this target for the full year. By embracing an efficiency mindset, we are also freeing up resources that can be reinvested in critical areas to improve the customer experience. A case in point is the investment we are making in group disability in the U.S. The shared goal of all stakeholders in the disability system whether employees, employers or insurance carriers is to achieve the best possible health outcomes and get people back to their lives and livelihoods as quickly as possible. 
We are implementing an end-to-end disability and absence management solution to meet changing customer expectations and extend our leadership in this space. By investing in the customer experience here and across our businesses, we deepen MetLife's competitive advantage into the future. 
The third pillar of our strategy is differentiation, those competitive advantages that set us apart from our peers. One of the most important is our talent. A major strength of being a truly global company is that we can redeploy talent to match it against our most promising opportunities. This is precisely what we have done and the latest round of leadership changes that MetLife announced last month. 
And I want to begin by thanking Oscar Schmidt for his exemplary service to MetLife over the past 26 years. Under his leadership, MetLife has grown to become the largest life insurer in Latin America, with a well-diversified set of leading businesses across the region. When Oscar steps away from his executive position at the end of the year, we will rotate a number of executives into new roles. 
Eric [indiscernible] will move from CEO of Japan to Head of Latin America, [indiscernible] Costain will move from Head of EMEA to CEO of Japan, and Nora Garcia will move from Deputy Head of EMEA to running the region. Taken together, these appointments demonstrate not only our commitment to talent development, but are deep bunch of leaders who are ready to step up immediately and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Another area of differentiation I want to highlight is sustainability, which is core to our purpose at MetLife. The best talent want to work for sustainable companies. Corporate customers want sustainability embedded in their supply chain. And investors are increasingly interested in owning companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance principles into how they operate. 
To highlight one example at MetLife, in September, we set ambitious new targets for our environmental performance. We committed to reduce our location-based greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, originate $20 billion in new green investments and direct $5 million to develop products and partnerships that will drive climate solutions, all by the year 2030. 
We believe sustainability can be a competitive differentiator for us. At a day long session with our Board of Directors in late September, we pressure tested every aspect of our next horizon strategy. We came away more confident than ever that our strategy will not only continue to guide us through the current environment but position us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. 
From capital deployment and digital acceleration to expense rigor and a culture of experimentation, we are accelerating the pace of change to win with customers and create shareholder value. Before I close, I would like to say a few words about one of the towering figures in the history of MetLife. John Creedon, MetLife's President and CEO from 1983 to '89, passed away on October 11 at the age of 96. John's path at MetLife literally took him from the mail room to the board room. 
Among his many notable achievements was hiring Snoopy and the peanuts gang, and furthering the company's expansion into global markets. But perhaps what best captures John's career was his passion for the customer. The overarching goal he had in every job was to exceed customer expectations. John's passing reminds us that we are stewards of a great institution. MetLife was around long before we got here, and it will be around long after we are gone. 
Our task is to create long-term value for MetLife's many stakeholders, including our shareholders, to ensure in the words of our purpose statement that we will be always with you build in a more confident future. With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion."

I will start with the 3Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our",2288,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our annual global actuarial assumption review as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter were $633 million or $945 million lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from higher long-term interest rates as well as the stronger equity markets in the quarter. 
The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. In addition, the actuarial assumption review accounted for $98 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, which I will now discuss in more detail on Page 4. 
During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term U.S. 10-year treasury interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. In addition to this 100 basis point reduction, we have extended our mean reversion rate to 12 years. 
These changes reflect expectations of lower interest rates for a longer period of time. The overall impact to earnings is consistent with the sensitivities provided on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Page 5 provides a breakdown of the actuarial assumption viewed by business segment. The vast majority of the earnings impact was in MetLife Holdings, primarily due to the change in our long-term U.S. interest rate assumption. 
We also had a few adjustments in Asia, Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to lower interest rates and various changes in policyholder behavior. On Page 6, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Both quarters exclude the impact of their respective actuarial assumption reviews. In addition, the prior year quarter had $88 million associated with our completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. 
Excluding these notable items, adjusted earnings were up 24% and 25% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 27% and 28% on a constant currency basis. Overall, variable investment income was higher than third quarter of '19 by $257 million after tax. 
This year-over-year increase in VII accounted for nearly 75% of the total adjusted earnings growth, favorable expense margins and solid volume growth or other key year-over-year drivers. Turning to the performance of our businesses. 
Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 7% year-over-year. The group life mortality ratio was 89.6%, and which improved sequentially and included roughly 3 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. This is at the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. We expect the group life mortality ratio in the fourth quarter to be modestly above the annual target range as fourth quarter tends to have higher seasonal Life claims, and we expect COVID-19 related claims will remain elevated. 
The interest adjusted benefit ratio for group non-medical health was 67.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77%, driven by favorable dental and disability results. As the quarter progressed, dental utilization came in above expectations, which was offset by the partial release of the unearned premium reserve we established in the second quarter. 
We expect this dental utilization trend to continue and would expect the group non-medical health ratio in the fourth quarter to be at the low end of its annual target range of 72% to 77%. In regards to the top line, group benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year due to growth across most products and markets as well as the partial release of the unearned dental premium reserve. 
Excluding the unearned dental premium reserve release, which totaled approximately $110 million, group benefits PFO growth would have been within the annual target range of 4% to 6%. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 73% year-over-year. The drivers were strong investment margins, primarily higher variable investment income, favorable underwriting margins of roughly $50 million in the quarter, of which we estimate approximately half is related to elevated COVID-19 mortality and volume growth. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 156 basis points, up 54 basis points year-over-year. 
Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates and an increase in prepayments of RMBS held on our books at a discount. Looking ahead, we expect RIS investment spreads in 4Q to decline sequentially primarily due to lower VII, but still come in at the top end of the annual guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS liability exposures grew 12.5% year-over-year driven by strong volume across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. 
While liability exposures grew, RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 8% year-over-year due to lower structured settlement and institutional income annuity sales. Regarding pension risk transfers, we had approximately $500 million of PRT sales in the quarter and are seeing a good pipeline building once again. Property & Casualty, or P&C adjusted earnings, were down 68% versus the prior year period, driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to higher catastrophe losses. 
The overall combined ratio was 104.2%, which was above our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 98.4%. Catastrophe losses were $115 million after-tax in the quarter, $60 million higher than 3Q of '19. This quarter's cats primarily related to a tropical storm that impacted the Northeast and severe windstorms in the Midwest. It was the highest quarterly cat loss for our P&C business in nearly a decade. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 34% and 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting and expense margins. In addition, Asia continues to benefit from solid volume growth, driven by higher general account assets under management, which were up 6% on an amortized cost basis. 
Looking ahead, we expect Asia's strong VII and favorable underwriting in 3Q to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 67% and 62% on a constant currency basis. Primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and lower Chilean and Kahe returns, which were essentially flat in the quarter. 
Elevated COVID-19 related Life claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $70 million after-tax in the quarter. We expect COVID-19 related claims in the fourth quarter to remain elevated. EMEA adjusted earnings were up 26% and 30% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims and group policies in the region as well as better expense margins and volume growth. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 35% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable underwriting margins, as lower claim incidents and long-term care more than offset marginally higher Life claims due to COVID-19. The Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 60.2%, which included 7.3 percentage points related to the actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this impact, the Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.9%, within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. 
Looking ahead to 4Q, we expect MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings to return to more normal levels due to lower VII and more normal underwriting results in long-term care. Corporate and other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result was modestly more favorable than the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $135 million, excluding notable items. 
This quarter's results reflect lower expenses, partially offset by less favorable investment margins as well as higher preferred stock dividends. As we outlined in our 2Q earnings call, we expect an adjusted loss range of $325 million to $375 million in the second half of 2020, which implies corporate and other adjusted losses to be between to $250 million in 4Q. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20% at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 7. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including $652 million in the third quarter of 2020. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 6.7% return in the quarter. 
As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a one quarter lag, and the positive marks included in our third quarter results are in line with the outlook offered in our last earnings call. There was also a positive contribution to VII from hedge funds, which had a 13% return in the quarter, as well as higher prepayment fees. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect VII to remain strong, but closer to the pre 2Q '20 trend levels. Now let's take a look at VII by segment on Page 8. This table breaks out the third quarter VII of $515 million after-tax by segment. The 3 largest recipients of VII in the quarter were MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia. The allocation of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns of their individual portfolios. 
That said, as a general rule, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% of the total VII and roughly split 1/3 each. Our new money rate was 2.76% versus a roll-off rate of 3.81% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 3.41% and a roll-off rate of 3.72% in 2Q of '20. 
The 65 basis point sequential decline in the new money rate was primarily due to tighter credit spreads in the quarter, purchases of short-term investments to match short-term issuances in our capital markets business, as well as higher liquidity at the holding company. We also purchased close to $1 billion in low-yielding foreign government bonds, primarily JGBs, to invest cash flows associated with recurring premium income from our Japanese yen in-force block. 
Looking ahead, we expect new money yields in 4Q to remain at comparable 3Q levels as we maintain our disciplined approach to investing in high-quality assets despite persistently tight credit spreads. Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 3 quarters of 2020. In 3Q, our direct expense ratio was 11.4%. This low ratio was driven by a reduction in direct expenses, increased availability of our dental services driving higher premium and a reserve release in corporate and other. 
Year-to-date, our direct expense ratio was 11.9%. We expect the direct expense ratio to be higher than trend in 4Q, primarily due to seasonality. In our group Benefits business, we incur higher enrollment and other costs prior to receiving premiums. Also, certain corporate initiative costs are expected to be higher in 4Q. 
Overall, as Mitchell noted, we are increasingly confident that we will beat our full year target of approximately 12.3%. As we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. I will now discuss our cash and capital on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, which is up from $6.6 billion at June 30, and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. 
The $1.2 billion increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily the result of a $1 billion preferred stock issuance in the quarter. The proceeds from this issuance were used in October to redeem $1 billion of preferred stock outstanding. In addition, cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends payments of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $80 million in the quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. company's preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.2 billion, while net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $200 million from the prior year period, primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by the favorable underwriting, higher separate account returns and lower operating expenses. 
Year-to-date, net income was lower due to the decrease in operating earnings and other realized losses. These were partially offset by derivative gains in the current year. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21 billion at September 30, up 12% compared to December 31, 2019. 
Operating income and derivative gains more than offset dividends paid. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, bolstered by an increase in variable investment income and supported by the solid fundamentals from a diverse set of market leading businesses. In addition, we believe our capital liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. 
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company, will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers, and our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And ultimately, I think this, we believe, underscores the durability of our all-weather next Horizon strategy and our consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. What I would say around sort of our capital management philosophy is that it has not changed. So we believe excess capital above and beyond what's required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchases, common dividends or strategic acquisitions that clear a minimum risk-adjusted hurdle rate. 
As you mentioned, as you referenced, after we complete our buyback authorization by year-end and the Versant acquisition, we expect to have a cash buffer well in excess of our $3 billion to $4 billion target, but no change in terms of our philosophy and how we would deploy excess capital."

So with respect to the non-medical health ratio, first, you've got the disability part of that business. Historically, you've seen a linkage, although be delayed linkage between recessions and increases in frequency and lower recoveries on the LTD book. We have not seen that yet. The results continue to track pretty favorably on the LTD side. But there is a lag, and we're continuing to monitor this pretty carefully. 
On the STD side, the COVID impact has been a push for us as we look forward. So higher coverage related claims have been offset by lower claims due to delays of elective surgeries, et cetera. So we continue to monitor the LTD book into next year. But I would remind you, we can reprice just shy of 50% of that business every year. So our block is about 13% of our PFOs and about half of that can be repriced every year. 
So this is a short term business, and we have a track record of being able to appropriately react to changes in the environment and get the rate changes that we need. On the dental side, this year has been an exceptional year in the sense that we've had all the shutdowns and that are COVID related in the second quarter. And hence, the rationale and the reason why you've set up the unearned premium reserves. 
As we look forward, in terms of the dental business, as John mentioned, as the quarter progressed, dental offices are more fully opened. And we started seeing utilization levels primarily in September that came in above our typical levels as the patients made up for those services. And this was offset by the partial release of the dental premium that was set up in the second quarter. Sitting here today, we expect to continue to see above typical utilization levels in the fourth quarter for dental. And you will also see us release the balance of the unearned premium reserve in the fourth quarter for the dental business."

And then we have longer tail legacy blocks that obviously would have some spread pressure over a long period of time.

Offsetting that, if you think about the other parts of RIS, we've seen more pressure in the structured settlements business, the institutional annuity business. And a lot of those businesses are rate sensitive. So the value proposition to the customer, if you will, is diminished and lower rate environment. And so think about the volumes there as being -- continuing to be driven by the rate environment. PRT, we're seeing it starting to pick up. As John mentioned, we're looking at a pretty healthy pipeline in our but as we've talked about before, we're not chasing top line here. 
We continue to be highly disciplined in terms of our pricing of every single deal that we look at in the PRT space. And then finally, as you probably have seen, we are now well into our entry into the U.K. longevity market. So far this year, we're close to $1 billion in sales in terms of longevity swaps, and we continue to see a robust pipeline there into Q4 into next year. I would just come back and reiterate for RIS. It's -- we've seen a very healthy top line. We've seen very healthy growth in liability balances.

I think I mentioned on our last earnings call that those got to about 9% of our principal balance outstanding, but that appears to be sort of where we topped out.

Let me say that the premise of your question is correct in the first part, so let me -- based on your question, let me start by putting a little bit of context to our sales performance in Q2. In the second quarter, lost owns and social distancing restrictions had a significant impact on our sales. And Q2 sales for Asia overall dropped 44%, 55% in Japan compared to prior year. 
To overcome this challenge, we took several distribution and product actions. As you're well aware of all the past investments we've been making in sales platforms. And on top of that, we implemented several digital solutions to augment our face-to-face interactions. And we also stepped up our sales management activities as well. 
And because of these actions, we've seen a very strong recovery in Q3 sales, as you rightly pointed out. Q3 sales increased sequentially, 63% for overall Asia, 85% in Japan. And our year-over-year drop is now reduced to 16%. So you asked about the repricing that was we did reprice our level premium FX product. It was contributing, but not a major factor in driving our sequential growth. 
So another way to look at this is to how we're seeing how this is going to play out for the rest of the year. We expect the impact of our actions that we've taken so far to sustain our Q3 momentum. While the environment is still challenging for face-to-face sales environment, we're seeing a pickup in our sales pipeline, and you should expect a positive year-on-year growth for Asia as a whole."

As you saw in our earnings release last night, MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpl",1608,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release last night, MetLife delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2020. These results are a testament to the kind of company that MetLife has become. We are simpler and more predictable. For example, the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review was modest and consistent with the sensitivities we provided last quarter. 
We have a well-diversified mix of market leading businesses. That diversity was on display in the largely offsetting impacts of COVID-19. And we have an ongoing commitment to consistent execution. A good quarter at MetLife is just another installment in what investors have come to expect of us and what we expect of ourselves. 
Turning to the numbers. We reported third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.73 per share compared to $1.27 per share a year ago. Net income of $633 million was below adjusted earnings, mostly due to losses on derivatives helped to protect our balance sheet against movements in equity markets and interest rates. For year-to-date 2020, MetLife has generated $5.1 billion of net income. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion or $1.95 per share compared to $1.4 billion or $1.54 per share a year ago. 
The only notable item in the quarter was our annual actuarial assumption review, which had a negative $203 million impact on adjusted earnings and an incremental negative $98 million impact on net income. This is largely a function of lowering our long-term interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. 
As expected, we experienced a significant recovery in our private equity portfolio, which we report on a 1-quarter lag. The rebound that occurred with 6.7% return tracked with the mid-single-digit forecast we provided in Q2. Other contributors, including hedge funds and prepayments, added meaningfully to our $652 million of pretax variable investment income. 
Turning to some third quarter business highlights. Our U.S. business segment produced very strong adjusted earnings driven by Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions. In Group Benefits, Group Life mortality experience improved from the second quarter and dental utilization and disability remains favorable. RIS benefited from the rebound in VII as well as temporarily wider recurring investment spreads. Offsetting this, Property & Casualty saw heavier than normal catastrophe losses that overwhelmed favorable auto claims frequency. 
Outside the U.S., Asia's adjusted earnings, ex notables, were up 34% from a year ago on higher VII, favorable underwriting, lower expenses and volume growth. Adjusted earnings, ex notables, in Latin America were down 67% year-over-year as COVID claims rose sharply, as expected. In EMEA, adjusted earnings, ex notables, increased 26% due to lower expenses, favorable underwriting and volume growth. And finally, for MetLife Holdings, adjusted earnings, ex notables, rose 35% on higher VII and better long-term care underwriting results. 
Our cash position strengthened during the quarter, ending at $7.8 billion, well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The increase in cash is mostly due to our issuance of $1 billion of fixed preferred stock during the quarter, which was used in October to retire $1 billion of floating preferred stock. As we committed in September, we have resumed repurchases of our common stock, roughly $80 million in the third quarter and about another $240 million since then. 
Despite the extreme disruption 2020 has presented, we are on track this year to deploy $4.3 billion of capital towards strategic M&A, common stock dividends and share repurchases. We believe this underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and MetLife's consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. 
We rolled out our Next Horizon strategy almost 1 year ago with 3 main pillars: focus on deploying scarce capital and resources to their highest use, simplify MetLife by driving operational efficiency and improving the customer experience and differentiate to drive competitive advantage in the marketplace. We believe we have made clear progress on all 3 fronts. 
At Investor Day last December, I noted that our capital management philosophy at MetLife has not changed. Capital is precious, and we are disciplined in deploying it to the highest-value opportunities. Our purchase of Versant Health, which we expect to close before year-end, demonstrates our commitment to this approach. Vision Care is a capital-light business with strong risk-adjusted returns and high free cash flow generation. Like our U.S. Group Benefits franchise more broadly, it is precisely the kind of business we want to grow. 
Knowing where not to play is just as important as knowing where to place our strategic bets. During the quarter, we booked the sale of our annuity business in Argentina, which was no longer the right fit for MetLife. While not material to MetLife, this divestment helps illustrate our ongoing process of planting and pruning in an effort to achieve the optimal business mix. 
When we talk about simplifying MetLife, we have 2 goals in mind: continuously improving our operational efficiency and becoming an easier company for our customers to do business with. On efficiency, given the headwinds we have faced this year, we knew it was going to be a challenge to meet our target of a 12.3% direct expense ratio, but this is a firm commitment, and we will keep it. 
Despite higher anticipated seasonal expenses in Q4, we are increasingly confident that we will beat this target for the full year. By embracing an efficiency mindset, we are also freeing up resources that can be reinvested in critical areas to improve the customer experience. A case in point is the investment we are making in group disability in the U.S. The shared goal of all stakeholders in the disability system, whether employees, employers or insurance carriers, is to achieve the best possible health outcomes and get people back to their lives and livelihoods as quickly as possible. We are implementing an end-to-end disability and absence management solution to meet changing customer expectations and extend our leadership in this space. By investing in the customer experience here and across our businesses, we deepen MetLife's competitive advantage into the future. 
The third pillar of our strategy is differentiation, those competitive advantages that set us apart from our peers. One of the most important is our talent. A major strength of being a truly global company is that we can redeploy talent to match it against our most promising opportunities. This is precisely what we have done in the latest round of leadership changes that MetLife announced last month. I want to begin by thanking Oscar Schmidt for his exemplary service to MetLife over the past 26 years. Under his leadership, MetLife has grown to become the largest life insurer in Latin America, with a well-diversified set of leading businesses across the region. When Oscar steps away from his executive position at the end of the year, we will rotate a number of executives into new roles. 
Eric Clurfain will move from CEO of Japan to Head of Latin America, Dirk Ostijn will move from Head of EMEA to CEO of Japan, and Nuria Garcia will move from Deputy Head of EMEA to running the region. Taken together, these appointments demonstrate not only our commitment to talent development but our deep bunch of leaders who are ready to step up immediately and deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Another area of differentiation I want to highlight is sustainability, which is core to our purpose at MetLife. The best talent want to work for sustainable companies. Corporate customers want sustainability embedded in their supply chain. And investors are increasingly interested in owning companies that incorporate environmental, social and governance principles into how they operate. 
To highlight one example at MetLife, in September, we set ambitious new targets for our environmental performance. We committed to reduce our location-based greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, originate $20 billion in new green investments and direct $5 million to develop products and partnerships that will drive climate solutions, all by the year 2030. 
We believe sustainability can be a competitive differentiator for us. At a daylong session with our Board of Directors in late September, we pressure tested every aspect of our Next Horizon strategy. We came away more confident than ever that our strategy will not only continue to guide us through the current environment but position us to emerge from the crisis in even stronger shape. From capital deployment and digital acceleration to expense rigor and a culture of experimentation, we are accelerating the pace of change to win with customers and create shareholder value. 
Before I close, I would like to say a few words about one of the towering figures in the history of MetLife. John Creedon, MetLife's President and CEO from 1983 to '89, passed away on October 11 at the age of 96. John's path at MetLife literally took him from the mail room to the board room.  Among his many notable achievements was hiring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang and furthering the company's expansion into global markets. But perhaps what best captures John's career was his passion for the customer. The overarching goal he had in every job was to exceed customer expectations. 
John's passing reminds us that we are stewards of a great institution. MetLife was around long before we got here, and it will be around long after we are gone. Our task is to create long-term value for MetLife's many stakeholders, including our shareholders, to ensure, in the words of our purpose statement, that we will be always with you building a more confident future. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion."

I will start with the 3Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our",2284,"Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will start with the 3Q '20 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition, the slide provides more detail on our annual global actuarial assumption review as well as an update on our cash and capital positions. 
Starting on Page 3, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income in the third quarter were $633 million or $945 million lower than adjusted earnings. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from higher long-term interest rates as well as the stronger equity markets in the quarter. 
The investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. In addition, the actuarial assumption review accounted for $98 million of the variance between net income and adjusted earnings, which I will now discuss in more detail on Page 4. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review reduced net income by $301 million, of which $203 million impacted adjusted earnings. The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term U.S. 10-year treasury interest rate assumption from 3.75% to 2.75%. In addition to this 100 basis point reduction, we have extended our mean reversion rate to 12 years. These changes reflect expectations of lower interest rates for a longer period of time. The overall impact to earnings is consistent with the sensitivities provided on our second quarter 2020 earnings call. 
Page 5 provides a breakdown of the actuarial assumption viewed by business segment. The vast majority of the earnings impact was in MetLife Holdings primarily due to the change in our long-term U.S. interest rate assumption. We also had a few adjustments in Asia, Latin America and EMEA primarily due to lower interest rates and various changes in policyholder behavior. 
On Page 6, you can see the year-over-year comparison of adjusted earnings by segment, excluding notable items in both periods. Both quarters exclude the impact of their respective actuarial assumption reviews. In addition, the prior year quarter had $88 million associated with our completed unit cost initiative, which was accounted for in corporate and other. Excluding these notable items, adjusted earnings were up 24% and 25% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 27% and 28% on a constant currency basis. 
Overall, variable investment income was higher than third quarter of '19 by $257 million after tax. This year-over-year increase in VII accounted for nearly 75% of the total adjusted earnings growth. Favorable expense margins and solid volume growth were other key year-over-year drivers. 
Turning to the performance of our businesses. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 7% year-over-year. The Group Life mortality ratio was 89.6%, and which improved sequentially and included roughly 3 percentage points related to COVID-19 claims. This is at the top end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. We expect the Group Life mortality ratio in the fourth quarter to be modestly above the annual target range as fourth quarter tends to have higher seasonal Life claims, and we expect COVID-19 related claims will remain elevated. 
The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for group nonmedical health was 67.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% driven by favorable dental and disability results. As the quarter progressed, dental utilization came in above expectations, which was offset by the partial release of the unearned premium reserve we established in the second quarter. We expect this dental utilization trend to continue and would expect the group nonmedical health ratio in the fourth quarter to be at the low end of its annual target range of 72% to 77%. 
In regards to the top line, Group Benefits adjusted PFOs were up 7% year-over-year due to growth across most products and markets as well as the partial release of the unearned dental premium reserve. Excluding the unearned dental premium reserve release, which totaled approximately $110 million, Group Benefits PFO growth would have been within the annual target range of 4% to 6%. 
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 73% year-over-year. The drivers were strong investment margins, primarily higher variable investment income; favorable underwriting margins of roughly $50 million in the quarter, of which we estimate approximately half is related to elevated COVID-19 mortality; and volume growth. RIS investment spreads for the quarter were 156 basis points, up 54 basis points year-over-year. Spreads, excluding VII, were 98 basis points in the quarter, up 19 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in LIBOR rates and an increase in prepayments of RMBS held on our books at a discount. 
Looking ahead, we expect RIS investment spreads in 4Q to decline sequentially, primarily due to lower VII, but still come in at the top end of the annual guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. 
RIS liability exposures grew 12.5% year-over-year driven by strong volume across the product portfolio as well as separate account investment performance. While liability exposures grew, RIS adjusted PFOs, excluding pension risk transfers, were down 8% year-over-year due to lower structured settlements and institutional income annuity sales. 
Regarding pension risk transfers, we had approximately $500 million of PRT sales in the quarter and are seeing a good pipeline building once again. 
Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 68% versus the prior year period driven by unfavorable underwriting margins due to higher catastrophe losses. The overall combined ratio was 104.2%, which was above our annual target range of 92% to 97% and the prior year quarter of 98.4%. Catastrophe losses were $115 million after tax in the quarter, $60 million higher than 3Q of '19. This quarter's cats primarily related to a tropical storm that impacted the Northeast and severe windstorms in the Midwest. It was the highest quarterly cat loss for our P&C business in nearly a decade. 
Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 34% and 32% on a constant currency basis primarily due to higher variable investment income as well as favorable underwriting and expense margins. In addition, Asia continues to benefit from solid volume growth driven by higher general account assets under management, which were up 6% on an amortized cost basis. Looking ahead, we expect Asia's strong VII and favorable underwriting in 3Q to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter. 
Latin America adjusted earnings were down 67% and 62% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by unfavorable underwriting and lower Chilean encaje returns, which were essentially flat in the quarter. Elevated COVID-19-related Life claims, primarily in Mexico, impacted Latin America's adjusted earnings by approximately $70 million after tax in the quarter. We expect COVID-19-related claims in the fourth quarter to remain elevated. 
EMEA adjusted earnings were up 26% and 30% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins as a result of lower claims and group policies in the region as well as better expense margins and volume growth. 
MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 35% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by higher private equity returns as well as favorable underwriting margins, as lower claim incidents and long-term care more than offset marginally higher Life claims due to COVID-19. The Life interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 60.2%, which included 7.3 percentage points related to the actuarial assumption review. Adjusting for this impact, the Life interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 52.9%, within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Looking ahead to 4Q, we expect MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings to return to more normal levels due to lower VII and more normal underwriting results in long-term care. 
Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $131 million. This result was modestly more favorable than the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $135 million, excluding notable items. This quarter's results reflect lower expenses partially offset by less favorable investment margins as well as higher preferred stock dividends. As we outlined in our 2Q earnings call, we expect an adjusted loss range of $325 million to $375 million in the second half of 2020, which implies Corporate & Other adjusted losses to be between $200 million to $250 million in 4Q. 
The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 20%, at the bottom of our 2020 guidance range of 20% to 22%. 
Now let's turn to VII in the quarter on Page 7. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income over the prior 5 quarters, including $652 million in the third quarter of 2020. This strong result was mostly attributable to the private equity portfolio, which had a 6.7% return in the quarter. As we have previously discussed, private equities are generally accounted for on a 1-quarter lag, and the positive marks included in our third quarter results are in line with the outlook offered in our last earnings call. There was also a positive contribution to VII from hedge funds, which had a 13% return in the quarter, as well as higher prepayment fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect VII to remain strong, but closer to the pre 2Q '20 trend levels. 
Now let's take a look at VII by segment on Page 8. This table breaks out the third quarter VII of $515 million after tax by segment. The 3 largest recipients of VII in the quarter were MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia. The allocation of VII by business segment is based on the quarterly returns of their individual portfolios. That said, as a general rule, MetLife Holdings, RIS and Asia will account for approximately 90% of the total VII and roughly split 1/3 each. 
Our new money rate was 2.76% versus a roll-off rate of 3.81% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 3.41% and a roll-off rate of 3.72% in 2Q of '20. The 65 basis point sequential decline in the new money rate was primarily due to tighter credit spreads in the quarter, purchases of short-term investments to match short-term issuances in our capital markets business as well as higher liquidity at the holding company. We also purchased close to $1 billion in low-yielding foreign government bonds, primarily JGBs, to invest cash flows associated with recurring premium income from our Japanese yen in-force block. Looking ahead, we expect new money yields in 4Q to remain at comparable 3Q levels as we maintain our disciplined approach to investing in high-quality assets despite persistently tight credit spreads. 
Turning to Page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019 and the first 3 quarters of 2020. In 3Q, our direct expense ratio was 11.4%. This low ratio was driven by a reduction in direct expenses, increased availability of our dental services driving higher premium and a reserve release in Corporate & Other. 
Year-to-date, our direct expense ratio was 11.9%. We expect the direct expense ratio to be higher than trend in 4Q primarily due to seasonality. In our Group Benefits business, we incur higher enrollment and other costs prior to receiving premiums. Also, certain corporate initiative costs are expected to be higher in 4Q. 
Overall, as Michel noted, we are increasingly confident that we will beat our full year target of approximately 12.3% as we continue to deploy an efficiency mindset to increase capacity for reinvestment and to protect the margins of the firm. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital on Page 10. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $7.8 billion at September 30, which is up from $6.6 billion at June 30 and well above our target cash buffer of $3 billion to $4 billion. The $1.2 billion increase in cash at the holding companies was primarily the result of a $1 billion preferred stock issuance in the quarter. The proceeds from this issuance were used in October to redeem $1 billion of preferred stock outstanding. 
In addition, cash at the holding companies reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payments of our common stock dividend, share repurchases of $80 million in the quarter as well as holding company expenses and other cash flows. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. company's preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2020 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.2 billion, while net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $200 million from the prior year period primarily due to higher VA rider reserves and the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. This was partially offset by the favorable underwriting, higher separate account returns and lower operating expenses. 
Year-to-date, net income was lower due to the decrease in operating earnings and other realized losses. These were partially offset by derivative gains in the current year. 
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $21 billion at September 30, up 12% compared to December 31, 2019. Operating income and derivative gains more than offset dividends paid. 
Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of June 30, which is the latest public data. 
Overall, MetLife delivered a strong quarter, bolstered by an increase in variable investment income and supported by the solid fundamentals from our diverse set of market-leading businesses. In addition, we believe our capital, liquidity and investment portfolio are strong, resilient and well-positioned to manage through and come out stronger in this challenging environment. 
Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to be a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term, sustainable value for our customers, and our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions."

And ultimately, I think this, we believe, underscores the durability of our all-weather Next Horizon strategy and our consistent execution across a range of economic scenarios. 
What I will say around sort of our capital management philosophy is that it has not changed.

As you mentioned, as you referenced, after we complete our buyback authorization by year-end and the Versant acquisition, we expect to have a cash buffer well in excess of our $3 billion to $4 billion target, but no change in terms of our philosophy and how we would deploy excess capital."

So with respect to the nonmedical health ratio, first, you've got the disability part of that business. Historically, you've seen a linkage, although be it delayed linkage, between recessions and increases in frequency and lower recoveries on the LTD book. We have not seen that yet. The results continue to track pretty favorably on the LTD side. But there is a lag, and we're continuing to monitor this pretty carefully. 
On the STD side, the COVID impact has been a push for us as we look forward. So higher COVID-related claims have been offset by lower claims due to delays of elective surgeries, et cetera. So we continue to monitor the LTD book into next year. But I would remind you, we can reprice just shy of 50% of that business every year. So our block is about 13% of our PFOs and about 1/2 of that can be repriced every year. So this is a short-term business, and we have a track record of being able to appropriately react to changes in the environment and get the rate changes that we need. 
On the dental side, this year has been an exceptional year in the sense that we've had all the shutdowns  that are COVID related in the second quarter, and hence, the rationale and the reason why we've set up the unearned premium reserves. 
As we look forward, in terms of the dental business, as John mentioned, as the quarter progressed, dental offices are more fully opened. And we started seeing utilization levels, primarily in September, that came in above our typical levels as the patients made up for those services, and this was offset by the partial release of the dental premium that we set up in the second quarter. 
Sitting here today, we expect to continue to see above typical utilization levels in the fourth quarter for dental. And you will also see us release the balance of the unearned premium reserve in the fourth quarter for the dental business."

Offsetting that, if you think about the other parts of RIS, we've seen more pressure in the Structured Settlements business, the institutional annuity business. And a lot of those businesses are rate sensitive, so the value proposition to the customer, if you will, is diminished in lower-rate environment. And so think about the volumes there as being -- continuing to be driven by the rate environment. 
PRT, we're seeing it starting to pick up. As John mentioned, we're looking at a pretty healthy pipeline in Q4. but as we've talked about before, we're not chasing top line here. We're continuing to be highly disciplined in terms of our pricing of every single deal that we look at in the PRT space. 
And then finally, as you probably have seen, we are now well into our entry into the U.K. longevity market. So far this year, we're close to $1 billion in sales in terms of longevity swaps, and we continue to see a robust pipeline there into Q4 and into next year. 
I would just come back and reiterate for RIS, it's -- we've seen a very healthy top line. We've seen very healthy growth in liability balances. But discipline is the name of the game here in terms of looking for the returns as opposed to chasing growth."

So let me -- based on your question, let me start by putting a little bit of context to our sales performance in Q2. 
In the second quarter, lockdowns and social distancing restrictions had a significant impact on our sales. And Q2 sales for Asia overall dropped 44%, 55% in Japan compared to prior year. To overcome this challenge, we took several distribution and product actions. 
As you're well aware of all the past investments we've been making in sales platforms. And on top of that, we implemented several digital solutions to augment our face-to-face interactions. And we also stepped up our sales management activities as well. And because of these actions, we've seen a very strong recovery in Q3 sales, as you rightly pointed out. Q3 sales increased sequentially 63% for overall Asia, 85% in Japan. And our year-over-year drop is now reduced to 16%. So you asked about the repricing that was -- we did reprice our level premium FX product, it was a contributing but not a major factor in driving our sequential growth. 
So another way to look at this is to how we're seeing how this is going to play out for the rest of the year. We expect the impact of our actions that we've taken so far to sustain our Q3 momentum. While the environment is still challenging for face-to-face sales environment, we're seeing a pickup in our sales pipeline, and you should expect a positive year-on-year growth for Asia as a whole.

And our investments here are in areas like pricing sophistication, contract competitiveness, clinical model in terms of the return-to-health initiatives, which are critical for the LTD business, and we're already seeing positive business outcomes. 
And that end-to-end disability and absence management solution, which Michel is talking about, is already resonating in the market with the larger employers. It includes things like the digital interface for claimants, AI-driven automated claim processing, sophisticated data analytics for employers so that they can understand their workforce. And we're expecting to see growth here although growth with discipline, in this area going forward."

I would just add just to Ramy's -- add to Ramy's point there and little bit to the way you asked the question. This is all part of the, as we refer to as, the efficiency mindset concept where we continue to drive efficiencies every quarter in the firm and look for opportunities then to redeploy that into strategic reinvestments to support our market-leading businesses, and doing all of that within our run rate costs. 
So I would just go back to that point. We made that point at Investor Day, and I think it's a key component for us as we move forward."
