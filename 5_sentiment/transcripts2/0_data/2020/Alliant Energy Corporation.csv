With me here today are John Larson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO as well as other members of the Senior Management team. 
Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. 
We issued a news release last night announcing Alliant Energy's year-end and fourth quarter financial results and affirmed our 2020 earnings guidance range issued in November 2019. This release as well as supplemental slides that will be referenced during today's call are available on the investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com. 
Before we begin, I need to remind you that the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 
In addition, this presentation contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and will be in the 10-K, both of which will be available on our website at www.alliantenergy.com. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to John."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers. And recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate National Engineers Week. Our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. And we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners with a total shareowner return of more than 33% in 2019. 
In 2019, we raised our annual dividend by $0.08 per share, which was the 16th straight year we increased our dividend. Our non-GAAP temperature normalized earnings of $2.26 per share grew by 7% over 2018's comparable number. This was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5% earnings per share growth. 
We continue to make great progress as we execute our customer-focused strategy. I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements, and Robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. 
First, as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet, we're proud to report we met our 2020 SOx, NOx and Mercury emission reduction goals 1 year early. 
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40% and as of the end of 2019, we've achieved a 35% reduction in CO2 from 2005 levels. Our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials. 
Our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves. We look forward to highlighting our strong ESG performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year. 
We are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments, putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities. 
One example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200-megawatt Whispering Willow North Wind project. We now have nearly 70% of our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our Iowa customers producing clean, efficient renewable energy. We are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year. 
An important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas facility located in Southern Wisconsin is over 98% complete and expected to be in service, producing low-cost energy for our Wisconsin customers in the coming weeks. The expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades. Our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly $80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments, solid operational performance and lower commodity prices. Another example of our strategy in action. 
An efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy. In 2019, we completed our AMI meter installations in Iowa, providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices. We also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid, reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs. 
Making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy. An example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call My Account. Once fully launched, customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage. This refreshed customer pool is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice, convenience and control over their energy use. 
I'll highlight one last area before I turn it over to Robert. Last fall, we announced the results of the year long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. This plan balances many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees. The blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1,000 megawatts of solar. 
In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our Wisconsin facilities. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments in 2019. Our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020. 
I'll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus: Continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy, customer-focused investments completed on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors, balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018.

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slide 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides. 
The non-GAAP adjustment in 2019 is related to an ATC equity earnings adjustments as a result of the November 1 decision regarding MISO transmission owners return on equity complaints. The $0.02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period. 
Our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 1% in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers. A few of our largest customers in Iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019, and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production, resulting in a lower industrial demand. Since industrial sales generated our lowest margins, these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results. 
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. Based on our current forecast, we are trending to the upper half of the range. 
We are also reaffirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. We have rebased our long-term earnings growth guidance of 2019, non-GAAP temperature normalized EPS of $2.26 per share. Our long-term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and earning our allowed rate of return. 
The key drivers of the 7% growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review order received last month. A walk from our 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on Slide 7. 
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales, which includes the impact of leap year. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020. Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. 
In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. These investments include the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be in service in the coming months. 
In Iowa, we are forecasting average residential electric bills for Iowa customers who will also remain relatively flat in 2020. As the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by $35 million of billing credits we will provide to Iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019. 
Also, more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020. 
As we look to the future, we have also added new low-cost wind PPA and we'll be ending the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, which will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will pull back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our 2020 financing plan summarized on Slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up a $250 million of new common equity. $225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in November 2019. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities. We expect the remaining $25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our share or direct program. 
Lastly, we have included our key regulatory initiatives on Slide 10. We have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation. 
In December and January, we received decisions regarding the first forward-looking test year rate filings in the state of Iowa. In the electric rate review decision, the IUB approved a new renewable energy rider, which allowed us to earn a return of and return on with 1,000 megawatts of new winds after they're placed in service. 
With the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls, our plan is to stay at a rate reviews in Iowa for at least the next few years. 
In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. This request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. 
In the second quarter, WPL also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. Key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the [indiscernible] wind farm expect to place into service later this year. We will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments. 
Lastly, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1,000 megawatts of new solar generation we announced last fall. We continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost-effective clean energy for our customers in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences. 
As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conferences available on our website.

312949,652903407,1917300,"Alliant Energy Corporation, 2019 Earnings Call, Feb 21, 2020",2020-02-21,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers. And recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate National Engineers Week. Our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. And we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners with a total shareowner return of more than 33% in 2019. 
In 2019, we raised our annual dividend by $0.08 per share, which was the 16th straight year we increased our dividend. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $2.26 per share grew by 7% over 2018's comparable number. This was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5% earnings per share growth. 
We continue to make great progress as we execute our customer-focused strategy. I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements, and Robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. 
First, as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet, we're proud to report we met our 2020 SOx, NOx and mercury emission reduction goals 1 year early. 
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40% and as of the end of 2019, we've achieved a 35% reduction in CO2 from 2005 levels.  Our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials. 
Our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves. We look forward to highlighting our strong ESG performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year. 
We are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments, putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities. 
One example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200-megawatt Whispering Willow North Wind project. We now have nearly 70% of our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our Iowa customers producing clean, efficient, renewable energy. We are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year. 
An important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas facility located in Southern Wisconsin is over 98% complete and expected to be in service, producing low-cost energy for our Wisconsin customers in the coming weeks. The expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades. Our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly $80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments, solid operational performance and lower commodity prices.  Another example of our strategy in action. 
An efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy. In 2019, we completed our AMI meter installations in Iowa, providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices. We also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid, reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs. 
Making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy. An example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call My Account. Once fully launched, customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage.  This refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice, convenience and control over their energy use. 
I'll highlight one last area before I turn it over to Robert. Last fall, we announced the results of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. This plan balances many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees. The blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1,000 megawatts of solar. 
In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our Wisconsin facilities. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments in 2019. Our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020. 
I'll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus: continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy, customer-focused investments completed on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors, balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher reven",1133,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides. 
The non-GAAP adjustment in 2019 is related to an ATC equity earnings adjustments as a result of the November FERC decision regarding MISO transmission owners return on equity complaints. The $0.02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period. 
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales declined 1% in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers. A few of our largest customers in Iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019, and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production, resulting in a lower industrial demand. Since industrial sales generate our lowest margins, these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results. 
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. Based on our current forecast, we are trending to the upper half of the range. 
We are also reaffirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. We have rebased our long-term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS of $2.26 per share. Our long-term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return. 
The key drivers of the 7% growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review order received last month. A walk from our 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on Slide 7. 
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales, which includes the impact of leap year. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020. Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. 
In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. These investments include the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be in service in the coming months. 
In Iowa, we are forecasting average residential electric bills for Iowa customers who will also remain relatively flat in 2020. As the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by $35 million of billing credits we will provide to Iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019. 
Also, more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020. 
As we look to the future, we have also added new low-cost wind PPAs and we'll be ending the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, which will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our 2020 financing plan summarized on Slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $250 million of new common equity. $225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in November 2019. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities. We expect the remaining $25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our Shareowner Direct program. 
Lastly, we have included our key regulatory initiatives on Slide 10. We have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation. 
In December and January, we received decisions regarding the first forward-looking test year rate filings in the state of Iowa. In the electric rate review decision, the IUB approved a new renewable energy rider, which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1,000 megawatts of new wind after they're placed in service. With the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls, our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in Iowa for at least the next few years. 
In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. This request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. 
In the second quarter, WPL also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. Key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the Kossuth Wind Farm we expect to place into service later this year. We will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments. 
Lastly, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1,000 megawatts of new solar generation we announced last fall. We continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects, including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost-effective clean energy for our customers in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences. 
As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conferences available on our website. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So I would think of those in the kind of single digits, maybe low single-digit percentage increases on an annual basis. So nothing very significant. And so we'll continue our strong track record of maintaining pretty low or relatively low rates for our customers in Wisconsin. 
And as far as settlement process, we do have a long history of constructive settlements and outcomes. We would continue to look forward to working with the stakeholders to try and reach a settlement with that after we make the initial filings sometime in that second or third quarter of this year."

And then we're also benefiting from lower interest expense, given interest rate environments that are currently there. So those are the primary drivers that we started out the year very well with."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers. And recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate National Engineers Week. Our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. And we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners with a total shareowner return of more than 33% in 2019. 
In 2019, we raised our annual dividend by $0.08 per share, which was the 16th straight year we increased our dividend. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $2.26 per share grew by 7% over 2018's comparable number. This was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5% earnings per share growth. 
We continue to make great progress as we execute our customer-focused strategy. I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements, and Robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. 
First, as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet, we're proud to report we met our 2020 SOx, NOx and mercury emission reduction goals 1 year early. 
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40% and as of the end of 2019, we've achieved a 35% reduction in CO2 from 2005 levels.  Our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials. 
Our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves. We look forward to highlighting our strong ESG performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year. 
We are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments, putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities. 
One example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200-megawatt Whispering Willow North Wind project. We now have nearly 70% of our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our Iowa customers producing clean, efficient, renewable energy. We are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year. 
An important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas facility located in Southern Wisconsin is over 98% complete and expected to be in service, producing low-cost energy for our Wisconsin customers in the coming weeks. The expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades. Our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly $80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments, solid operational performance and lower commodity prices.  Another example of our strategy in action. 
An efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy. In 2019, we completed our AMI meter installations in Iowa, providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices. We also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid, reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs. 
Making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy. 
An example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call My Account. Once fully launched, customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage.  This refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice, convenience and control over their energy use. 
I'll highlight one last area before I turn it over to Robert. Last fall, we announced the results of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. This plan balances many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees. The blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1,000 megawatts of solar. 
In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our Wisconsin facilities. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments in 2019. Our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020. 
I'll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus: continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy, customer-focused investments completed on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors, balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018.

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides. 
The non-GAAP adjustment in 2019 is related to an ATC equity earnings adjustments as a result of the November FERC decision regarding MISO transmission owners return on equity complaints. The $0.02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period. 
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales declined 1% in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers. A few of our largest customers in Iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019, and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production, resulting in a lower industrial demand. Since industrial sales generate our lowest margins, these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results. 
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. Based on our current forecast, we are trending to the upper half of the range. 
We are also reaffirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. We have rebased our long-term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS of $2.26 per share. Our long-term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return. 
The key drivers of the 7% growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review order received last month. A walk from our 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on Slide 7. 
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales, which includes the impact of leap year. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020. Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. 
In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. These investments include the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be in service in the coming months. 
In Iowa, we are forecasting average residential electric bills for Iowa customers, who will also remain relatively flat in 2020. As the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by $35 million of billing credits we will provide to Iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019. 
Also, more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020. 
As we look to the future, we have also added new low-cost wind PPAs and we'll be ending the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, which will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our 2020 financing plan summarized on Slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $250 million of new common equity. $225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in November 2019. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities. We expect the remaining $25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our Shareowner Direct program. 
Lastly, we have included our key regulatory initiatives on Slide 10. We have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation. 
In December and January, we received decisions regarding the first forward-looking test year rate filings in the state of Iowa. In the electric rate review decision, the IUB approved a new renewable energy rider, which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1,000 megawatts of new wind after displaced in service. With the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls, our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in Iowa for at least the next few years. 
In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. This request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. 
In the second quarter, WPL also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. Key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the Kossuth Wind Farm we expect to place into service later this year. We will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and it's regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments. 
Lastly, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1,000 megawatts of new solar generation, we announced last fall. We continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects, including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost-effective clean energy for our customers in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences. 
As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conferences available on our website. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

You made very impressive progress to-date, and I'm glad to see you emphasizing that a bit more in the slide deck. Thanks for that too. John, I think you mentioned you'll update the corporate sustainability goal later this year. Do you have any sense of what that means for a longer-term carbon reduction goal? You got your 2030 target. What might it take to get even bigger reduction, say for carbon dioxide by 2040 or '50?

And then we're also benefiting from lower interest expense, given interest rate environments that are currently there. So those are the primary drivers that we started out the year very well with."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2019 was another excellent year for our company, both financially and operationally, made possible by the dedicated men and women of Alliant Energy. I want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers. And recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate National Engineers Week. Our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. And we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners with a total shareowner return of more than 33% in 2019. 
In 2019, we raised our annual dividend by $0.08 per share, which was the 16th straight year we increased our dividend. Our non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings of $2.26 per share grew by 7% over 2018's comparable number. This was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5% earnings per share growth. 
We continue to make great progress as we execute our customer-focused strategy. I'll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements, and Robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes. 
First, as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet, we're proud to report we met our 2020 SOx, NOx and mercury emission reduction goals 1 year early. 
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40% and as of the end of 2019, we've achieved a 35% reduction in CO2 from 2005 levels.  Our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials. 
Our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves. We look forward to highlighting our strong ESG performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year. 
We are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments, putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities. 
One example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200-megawatt Whispering Willow North Wind project. We now have nearly 70% of our planned 1,000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our Iowa customers producing clean, efficient, renewable energy. We are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year. 
An important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the West Riverside Energy Center. This highly efficient natural gas facility located in Southern Wisconsin is over 98% complete and expected to be in service, producing low-cost energy for our Wisconsin customers in the coming weeks. The expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades. Our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly $80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments, solid operational performance and lower commodity prices.  Another example of our strategy in action. 
An efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy. In 2019, we completed our AMI meter installations in Iowa, providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices. We also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid, reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs. 
Making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy. 
An example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call My Account. Once fully launched, customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage.  This refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice, convenience and control over their energy use. 
I'll highlight one last area before I turn it over to Robert. Last fall, we announced the results of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. This plan balances many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees. The blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1,000 megawatts of solar. 
In the coming months, we'll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our Wisconsin facilities. 
I'm excited about our accomplishments in 2019. Our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020. 
I'll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus: continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy, customer-focused investments completed on time and on budget, delivering solid returns for our investors, balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018.

I'm pleased to report that 2019 GAAP earnings were $2.33 per share compared to $2.19 per share in 2018. Excluding non-GAAP adjustments and temperature impacts, earnings were up 7% year-over-year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on Slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides. 
The non-GAAP adjustment in 2019 is related to an ATC equity earnings adjustments as a result of the November FERC decision regarding MISO transmission owners return on equity complaints. The $0.02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period. 
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales declined 1% in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers. A few of our largest customers in Iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019, and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production, resulting in a lower industrial demand. Since industrial sales generate our lowest margins, these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results. 
Turning to this year's earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. Based on our current forecast, we are trending to the upper half of the range. 
We are also reaffirming our long-term annual earnings growth guidance of 5% to 7%. We have rebased our long-term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized EPS of $2.26 per share. Our long-term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans, modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return. 
The key drivers of the 7% growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2020 and IPL's retail electric rate review order received last month. A walk from our 2019 non-GAAP temperature-normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on Slide 7. 
The 2020 guidance range assumes a 1% growth in retail electric sales, which includes the impact of leap year. We are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020. Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. 
In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. These investments include the highly efficient West Riverside Energy Center, which will be in service in the coming months. 
In Iowa, we are forecasting average residential electric bills for Iowa customers, who will also remain relatively flat in 2020. As the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by $35 million of billing credits we will provide to Iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019. 
Also, more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020. 
As we look to the future, we have also added new low-cost wind PPAs and we'll be ending the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, which will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities in our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins. Thus, the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our 2020 financing plan summarized on Slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last November, including issuing up to $250 million of new common equity. $225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in November 2019. We expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities. We expect the remaining $25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our Shareowner Direct program. 
Lastly, we have included our key regulatory initiatives on Slide 10. We have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation. 
In December and January, we received decisions regarding the first forward-looking test year rate filings in the state of Iowa. In the electric rate review decision, the IUB approved a new renewable energy rider, which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1,000 megawatts of new wind after displaced in service. With the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls, our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in Iowa for at least the next few years. 
In Wisconsin, we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20% in Western Wisconsin. This request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve. We expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020. 
In the second quarter, WPL also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022. Key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the Kossuth Wind Farm we expect to place into service later this year. We will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and it's regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments. 
Lastly, in Wisconsin, we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1,000 megawatts of new solar generation, we announced last fall. We continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects, including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost-effective clean energy for our customers in Wisconsin. 
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences. 
As always, we will make our Investor Relations materials used at the conferences available on our website. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

With respect to Iowa and solar, I'm thinking more specifically on the legislative side, there's been some development -- and I know there was a carryover bill. I know there was perhaps a deal in the last day here, at least in the local news teams. Can you talk about what any of it in Iowa, from a [ large-city ] perspective, may mean ultimately to you specifically, knowing that not all of it is necessarily focused on Alliant utility-scale solar in terms of what was contemplated there? 
And then separately, I'll throw my second question out there at the same time. Coming back to Wisconsin, you alluded in your remarks to some development coming up ahead in the next months. I wasn't quite sure if that pertained directly to the solar filing you're making? Or with respect to the voluntary filing you made earlier.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic.

I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health prices first started, we reached out to our nonproduct partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, design to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities.

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019.

These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4.

The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Canadian facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering our earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Italgas Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account costs related to COVID-19. Lastly, during times of low imagery prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
modeling our quarterly earnings this year,  it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase were to effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, with the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kasedin project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking entire treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing, the continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and in labor refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the delay normal PPA later this year, both of this we'll begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by our Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of on Slide 10 with four notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from the board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin graded its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as John indicated, the remainder of the decreases are largely related to elimination of discretionary spending. Think of that as cost we incur for travel and employee expenses that have been suspended at this point in time as well as some contractors that were in are going to pursue. And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gain some efficiencies and automate some of our So we feel well positioned to be able to execute on those and offset these sales declines."

And as we put forward, now is the right time to think about introducing a couple of these important projects, our Pursuit project namely is one of those that would be able to put forward as well as our West Riverside. And then have a number of these offsets that could keep customer rates flat. So we've had a lot of productive discussions, felt that went well, and we appreciate that.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide",1283,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health crisis first started, we reached out to our nonprofit partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, design to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. 
Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",1342,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and timing of income tax expense. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
The solid start to the year accounts for approximately 30% of our 2020 earnings targets and allows us to reaffirm our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL's and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. 
On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. 
We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering on earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Iowa Utilities Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account -- costs related to COVID-19. 
Lastly, during times of low energy prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
To assist you in modeling in our quarterly earnings this year, it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, with the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking escrow treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and the interim rate refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa -- to customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. 
As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the [ Duane ] PPA later this year, both of this will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by our Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by Iowa utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 10 with four notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from Iowa Utilities Board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin granted its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components to our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as John indicated, the remainder of the decreases are largely related to elimination of discretionary spending. Think of that as cost we incur for travel and employee expenses that have been suspended at this point in time as well as some contractors that we are no longer going to pursue. And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gained some efficiencies and automate some of plants. So we feel well positioned to be able to execute on those and offset these sales decline."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide",1283,"Thank you, Sue. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health crisis first started, we reached out to our nonprofit partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, design to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. 
Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",1342,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and timing of income tax expense. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
The solid start to the year accounts for approximately 30% of our 2020 earnings targets and allows us to reaffirm our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL's and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. 
On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. 
We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering on earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Iowa Utilities Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account -- costs related to COVID-19. 
Lastly, during times of low energy prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
To assist you in modeling in our quarterly earnings this year, it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, with the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking escrow treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and the interim rate refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa -- to customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. 
As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the [ Duane ] PPA later this year, both of this will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by our Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by Iowa utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 10 with four notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from Iowa Utilities Board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin granted its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components to our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as John indicated, the remainder of the decreases are largely related to elimination of discretionary spending. Think of that as cost we incur for travel and employee expenses that have been suspended at this point in time as well as some contractors that we are no longer going to pursue. And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gained some efficiencies and automate some of plants. So we feel well positioned to be able to execute on those and offset these sales decline."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic.

I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health crisis first started, we reached out to our nonprofit partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, designed to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",1337,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and timing of income tax expense. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
The solid start to the year accounts for approximately 30% of our 2020 earnings targets and allows us to reaffirm our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside Canadian facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased for approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering our earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Iowa Utilities Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account costs related to COVID-19. Lastly, during times of low energy prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
Modeling our quarterly earnings this year, it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, but the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking [ intrical ] treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing, the continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and in rebate refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa for customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the delay normal PPA later this year, both of this we'll begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by a variety of utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives on Slide 10 with 4 notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin granted its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gain some efficiencies and automate some of our tests.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic.

I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health crisis first started, we reached out to our nonprofit partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, designed to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",1335,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and timing of income tax expense. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
The solid start to the year accounts for approximately 30% of our 2020 earnings targets and allows us to reaffirm our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside wind facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased for approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering our earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Iowa Utilities Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account costs related to COVID-19. Lastly, during times of low energy prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
Modeling our quarterly earnings this year, it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, but the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking [ intrical ] treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing, the continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and in rebate refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa for customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the delay normal PPA later this year, both of this will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by Iowa Utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives on Slide 10 with 4 notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin granted its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gain some efficiencies and automate some of our tests.

And then I have a number of these offsets that could keep customer rates flat. So we've had a lot of productive discussions, felt that went well, and we appreciate that. As far as timing, Alex, I would -- I think we're looking at maybe roughly third quarter timing, obviously, that's subject to making sure we have all the information and respond to questions that the regulators have. But we feel comfortable with the filing. We think it's the right thing to do for customers."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic.

I'll start with a review of several actions we've taken to continue our critical service to our customers and communities during the current pandemic. I'll draw your attention to Slide 2. These are indeed unprecedented times and brings to life the values that guide our every decision. One of those values is caring for others. We understand the responsibility that comes with the essential service we provide. The Alliant Energy team has taken several steps to continue safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. We're focused now more than ever to ensure uninterrupted energy delivery. So those on the front lines can help those in need, businesses can operate and provide critical products and services, charitable organizations can support those most vulnerable and our customers can focus on their health and well-being. 
Like many of you, we've adjusted the way we work, and many of our employees now work from home. We've made changes to our operations to ensure we can safely keep the lights on and the gas flowing. We're following the important guidance from the CDC, maintaining physical distances and adding additional precautions like wearing face coverings and gloves when the situation requires. And we're rotating shifts for certain functions to limit exposure and business disruption. Another one of our core values is to do the right thing. Temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late fees for our customers was the right thing to do. In addition, we knew that now was the time for a creative way to keep rates low and predictable for our customers. We filed a proposal in Wisconsin to keep customer rates steady through the end of 2021. This filing is a continuation of our ongoing efforts to maintain among the lowest rates in the state. And in Iowa, with our continued focus on cost reductions and the new renewable energy rider, we do not anticipate filing an electric rate review for the next couple of years. 
When the health crisis first started, we reached out to our nonprofit partners to understand the unmet needs in the communities we're so privileged to serve. Over the past several weeks, we've made donations to several local charities such as food banks, the American Red Cross and the United Way. We also provided a $2 million contribution to the Hometown Care Energy Fund to support families who need assistance in paying their bills. And through a partnership with Iowa State University, we've been providing 3D-printed face shields to local medical facilities and health care workers. I think we can all agree that times like these is when the social part of ESG matters the most. 
Despite the disruption in many personal impacts this pandemic has had, our employees' commitment to our customers and communities has been remarkable. I'm proud to work for Alliant Energy and thankful for all our teams are doing to help our customers. They're living our values and delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities. 
Times like these also require accurate and real-time monitoring and energy use. It allows us to make better decisions. The important investments we made in smart meter technology has been a critical part of our planning efforts. Since the crisis began, we've spent time to understand the impacts on our customers and demand for our services. Robert will address the trends we're seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer base. However, I want to mention 3 important factors to keep in mind, as Robert outlines the impacts. One, we have a diverse customer base and operate in 2 constructive regulatory jurisdictions; two, we have summer pricing in place in our Iowa business; and three, our larger commercial and industrial electric margins include both an energy and demand component. We've managed through many economic cycles over our 100-year history, and drawing upon that experience, we're keeping a strong focus on our operational and financial discipline. Therefore, I'm reaffirming our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 to $2.48. We remain committed to our 5% to 7% growth target and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Our first quarter of 2020 was a solid start to the year, both financially and operationally. This was a direct result of the planning and execution of our long-term strategy, designed to focus on customer costs, smart investments and advancing a clean energy future. Despite operating in a time of great uncertainty, we continue to make great progress advancing our transition to a more efficient, modern and balanced energy portfolio. 
In the first quarter, we achieved another major milestone when we placed 400 megawatts of new wind into service for our Iowa customers. These 2 new wind farms, the Whispering Willow North and Golden Plains were completed on schedule and below budget, continuing our long track record of meeting or exceeding expectations established when we request construction authority from our regulators. And we're on track to install an additional 200 megawatts of new wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. This will complete the full 1,000 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Iowa Utility Board and also 150 megawatts of renewable investment approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. 
Our experience in planning, developing and constructing renewable energy resources puts us in a great position to advance even more renewable energy for our customers. We are now entering the regulatory approval phase of our 1,000 megawatt solar build-out in Wisconsin. We are in advanced discussion with developers and anticipate filing a Certificate of Authority for approximately 2/3 of the 1,000 megawatts by the end of this quarter. Our Wisconsin solar investments will be enough to power more than 260,000 homes with clean and affordable energy from the sun. 
The expansion of the Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio was a result of a year-long voluntary resource planning process we call the Wisconsin Clean Energy Blueprint. We started the Iowa Clean Energy Blueprint process and plan to share our proposal -- our proposed resource plan for Iowa toward the end of this year. These plans balance many important goals, including reliability, affordability, building stronger communities and the impacts the transitions may have on our talented and dedicated employees. 
I'm pleased to report that we're making great strides towards achieving another major milestone in our generation transformation strategy. West Riverside Energy Center, located near Beloit, Wisconsin has met several key testing criteria. We anticipate this 730-megawatt highly efficient natural gas resource to be completed below budget and in time to meet the upcoming customer demand. This resource will bring significant benefits to our customers through lower fuel costs and continued reliability as a complement to the renewable resources in the Midwest. Alliant Energy is committed to providing reliable, economical energy and also in a sustainable manner. I'm very pleased to report that the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure has awarded our West Riverside Energy Center with its highest certification, which is Platinum. This certification recognizes our commitment to construct sustainable projects and reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship in collaboration with local communities and landowners. Congratulations to our West Riverside team for accomplishing this important and distinguished achievement. 
In closing, let me summarize the key messages. We are continuing to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy to our customers, advancing our clean energy strategy, on schedule and on budget, ensuring our investments are efficient and customer focused, and delivering solid returns for our investors and continuing to focus on the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and communities. Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I will now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas",1341,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share compared to $0.53 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by higher electric and gas margins from increasing rate base and timing of income tax expense. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower sales due to warmer winter temperatures in the first quarter and higher depreciation expense. We have provided additional details on the earnings range drivers for the first quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
The solid start to the year accounts for approximately 30% of our 2020 earnings targets and allows us to reaffirm our 2020 earnings guidance of $2.34 per share to $2.48 per share. The key drivers of the growth in 2020 EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's West Riverside generating facility and IPL's wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in IPL’s and WPL's approved electric rates for 2020. As John indicated, like many of our utility peers, we are expecting lower retail sales in 2020 due to the impacts of a pandemic. 
As noted on Slide 5, we experienced a 4% increase in residential sales in April, driven largely by more people working from home. Our residential customers represent nearly 50% of our retail electric margins and every 1% change in annual residential sales increased for approximately $0.02 of earnings per share. On the commercial and industrial side, the story is different. Our C&I sales decreased by 13% in April, and every 1% change in annual C&I sales increased to approximately $0.02 of EPS. Under an assumption that the more significant pandemic-related sales declines extend through the end of the second quarter and a slow recovery through the end of the year, we are forecasting approximately 5% lower overall retail sales this year. We are positioned to continue our long track record of delivering on earnings growth targets by mitigating COVID-19 impacts, as noted on Slide 6. We will accelerate transformation activities and reduce discretionary spending to lower costs, offsetting a large portion of the COVID-19 impact. In addition, both the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Iowa Utilities Board have issued orders authorizing use of regulatory accounts to defer incremental account costs related to COVID-19. Lastly, during times of low energy prices, like now, we have an opportunity to capture and keep a portion of fuel cost savings through WPL's fuel sharing mechanism, which is also expected to help offset a portion of the COVID-19 impacts in 2020. 
To assist you in modeling our quarterly earnings this year, it is important to note that the projected increase in earnings for 2020 will not be recognized ratably throughout the year. For example, IPL's interim rate increase went into effect April 1, 2019, thereby skewing more of the full year increase in earnings to the first quarter of 2020. Also, the timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. We expect favorable earnings variances from the timing of tax expense to continue through the first half of the year and then reverse in the second half of 2020. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 12% for 2020. The primary drivers for the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins, but the decrease in the effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral. 
Our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers. In Wisconsin, we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments. 
Earlier this month, we proposed an extension of the current Wisconsin electric and gas rates through 2021. 
As summarized on Slide 8, we are proposing to use additional fuel cost reductions and tax benefits to offset the increased revenue requirements in 2021 associated with rate base additions, which includes the 150-megawatt Kossuth wind project and the Western Wisconsin gas pipeline expansion. And since the duration of the impacts of COVID-19 is unclear, we are seeking escrow treatment for bad debt and retirement plan expenses and the flexibility to adjust regulatory liability and escrow mechanisms to address the possible impacts on 2021 sales demand. 
Finally, the 2021 rate filing was the continuation of our current authorized ROE of 10%, our current authorized common equity component and a regulatory capital structure of 52.5% and our current ROE sharing mechanism. 
Turning to Iowa. We plan to reduce our electric customer bills with $35 million of credits related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds. We also expect increased reductions tax credits and significant fuel cost reductions to flow back to Iowa for customers in 2020 as a result of further expansion of wind generation and low natural gas prices. Our Iowa gas customers are also expected to see benefits in 2020 due to lower energy efficiency charges as a result of 2018 Iowa legislation. As we look to the future in Iowa, we have taken further action to reduce costs for our electric customers with the addition of new low-cost wind PPAs and the termination of the Duane Arnold PPA later this year, both of this will begin saving our Iowa electric customers money in 2021. 
Moving to our 2020 financing plans, which are shown on Slide 9. During the first quarter, we took steps to improve our already solid liquidity position. These included 2 debt offerings. First was the refinancing of a $300 million term loan for our nonregulated businesses. And second was the issuance of $350 million of 30-year debentures by our Wisconsin Utility. Both debt deals were well received by the market with favorable interest rates, allowing us to lower our overall average cost of debt. In addition, in March, we also issued the common equity planned in 2020 from our equity forward agreements, generating proceeds of $222 million. With these actions, we increased our current liquidity to approximately $1.2 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. Our remaining financings planned for 2020 include issuing up to $300 million of long-term debt by Iowa Utility. 
And with the execution of our equity forward agreements, we have no further material equity issuance planned for the foreseeable future. With a large portion of our 2020 financing plan already complete and only $350 million of debt maturities over the next 2 years, we believe we are well positioned to respond to any potential disruptions in cash flows that may result from the pandemic. We may adjust the financing plan if market conditions warrant and as our external financing needs are reassessed. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives as noted on Slide 10 with 4 notable development so far this year. First, IPL received approval from the Iowa Utilities Board to implement final retail electric rates and the new renewable energy rider in February. Second, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin granted its construction authority for the Western Wisconsin pipeline expansion in March. Third, we filed WPL's 2021 rate stabilization plan for electric and gas customers, which I outlined earlier. And finally, both state commissions have approved accounting deferral orders related to COVID-19 incremental costs. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our overall operational and financial goals for 2020 and 2021. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with many of you virtually over the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

Certainly with the COVID impacts, we know we have to further reduce -- the good news here is we've had a lot of work internally on planning for cost reductions. So we'll see some acceleration of plans that we had. Certainly, this isn't the first time we've had to react for our company during economic downturns. So we'll take a look. There are a number of levers that we have to reduce costs so we would see addressing that here this year. And maybe for a few more details, I'll see if Robert wants to add a couple of points."

But we're going to benefit from the fact that our pension costs are expected to be lower in 2020, largely because of the favorable returns we saw in '19. And as John indicated, the remainder of the decreases are largely related to elimination of discretionary spending. Think of that as cost we incur for travel and employee expenses that have been suspended at this point in time as well as some contractors that we are no longer are going to pursue. And then as John also indicated, quite a bit of acceleration of some of the planned transformation activities where we're going through and reevaluating processes across the organization that gain some efficiencies and automate some of our tests. So we feel well positioned to be able to execute on those and offset these sales decline."

And as we put forward, now is the right time to think about introducing a couple of these important projects, our Kossuth project, namely is one of those that we'd be able to put forward as well as our West Riverside. And then I have a number of these offsets that could keep customer rates flat. So we've had a lot of productive discussions, felt that went well, and we appreciate that.

Thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020. I'll share a few notable stories from the quarter and then turn the call over to Robert as he recaps some of our regulatory, customer and financial highlights. 
I'll start my comments with a focus on our recently issued corporate responsibility report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship, as well as our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve. On the environmental front, we were excited to announce that we achieved our 2030 goal of having 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources, 10 years ahead of schedule. And we're not stopping there. Our customer-focused strategy continues to advance us toward a clean energy future. And our responsibility report has been updated with new and even more aggressive clean energy goals. These new goals are shown on Slide 2 of the supplemental slides. 
Our report also highlights the great work of our employees to support our customers and communities. This is not new for Alliant Energy. It's part of how we do business. We've continued to support our customers and communities as they respond to the ongoing demands of the COVID-19 health and economic crisis. Our charitable foundation recently released a new wave of community grants, benefiting more than 230 nonprofit organizations across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our stated purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities is core to everything we do, and we're proud of the many ways we help to build stronger communities where we live, work and raise our families. 
Now more than ever, the social part of our corporate responsibility is at the forefront. We are committed to partnering with our communities, working to understand and help address their needs. We act by providing financial support to agencies and nonprofit organizations that help our communities bridge gaps of social and equities and through programs that support food and security and housing, workforce readiness, environmental stewardship and diversity, safety and well-being. Our employees and retirees are a driving force in our communities. And I'm very proud to be part of the company that lives our values in so many ways. 
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert, who will address the trends we are seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer bases as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Our employees have made great progress in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts during the first half of the year while keeping a strong focus on safety and reliability. 
Turning to the execution of our strategy. I'll highlight progress we've made as we advance our clean energy vision. A key driver to achieving our goals is the continued successful advancement of new renewable energy source, wind and solar. In May, we filed a Certificate of Authority with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. 
Collectively, these solar projects are expected to create more than 1,200 local construction jobs and once operational, will provide an estimated $80 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years. 
In conjunction with our solar filing, we also announced our plans to retire our Edgewater generating station. Our efforts to transition our generation to a cleaner and more efficient fleet are not new. In fact, we've been on this path for over a decade. As we have in the past, we will live our values to care for others and do the right thing as we support the transition of impacted employees in the Sheboygan community. 
The expansion of our Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio as well as the decision to retire the Edgewater facility,was a result of a year-long process that involved working with key stakeholders and ultimately forming what we call our Clean Energy blueprint. We have a similar process started in Iowa and expect to share the results of our Clean Energy blueprint for our IPL business later this year. 
Speaking of Iowa, I'll also share that we recently announced an innovative partnership with the City of Decorah. The new project features a 2.5 megawatt battery storage facility to support distributed solar. This battery system will help us better serve the community and allow us to efficiently integrate a growing desire for distributed energy resources. 
And while a lot of great work is happening related to solar and energy storage, I also want to highlight American Wind Week, which kicks off next Monday. We are proud to be part of advancing wind energy and the many benefits it brings to our customers and rural communities. 
We remain on track to install an additional 280 megawatts of wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. Our 130-megawatt Richland wind farm will be completed by the end of the third quarter and our 150-megawatt pursued wind farm is 80% complete and will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the United States. 
To summarize, we remain committed to focusing on the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our clean energy vision, ensuring our investments are well executed, efficient and customer-focused and delivering consistent returns for our investors with a 5% to 7% growth rate and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio. 
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,678277295,2065040,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2020",2020-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year driven by increasing rate base a",1031,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year driven by increasing rate base and higher electric margins from warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation results. we provided additional details on earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 3 and 4. 
Our temperature normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residential temperature normalized sales increased 5% year-over-year, largely driven by our customers spending more time at home. 
On the other hand, commercial and industrial temperature normalized sales declined 9%. 
Manufacturing sales, which make up approximately 50% of our commercial and industrial sales were down 15% to 25% during April and May. And as expected, we saw material declines in electric sales in April and May, to other sectors of our commercial and industrial customers, including retail, lodging and freed service as a result of temporary business closures. 
More recently, we've been encouraged to see electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers rebound in June and July to levels that were only modestly lower than the same month last year. We are also fortunate to have a broad diversity of customers across our 2 state jurisdictions. But even saw certain customers such as our food processing, packaging and warehouse customers having flat to higher than normal sales at the initial months of the pandemic. 
With the faster-than-expected rebound in electric sales, we have updated our current projections to reflect an approximate 2% to 3% reduction in temperature normalized electric sales for calendar year 2020 compared to last year. 
We have made significant progress mitigating this pandemic related sales declines by accelerating planned cost transformation activities and reimagining how we do work. This is a direct reflection of our employees' leadership and dedication to reducing cost for our customers. 
I speak for the entire executive team in sharing my appreciation for the employees of Alliant Energy, especially for the men and women who are in the field each day, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of affordable energy to our customers throughout the pandemic. 
The health crisis has reaffirmed how essential energy services are to the country. And a reminder of just how critical our purpose is to the communities and customers we serve. 
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 10% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate or production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits, which flowed back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins, thereby resulting in no material impact on full year earnings. The timing of wound production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized, will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. This results in higher earnings in the first half of the year, and lower earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the results of last year. 
On Slide 7, we have provided the details of our financial plan for 2020, which has now largely been completed. In June, we finalized a $400 million 10-year bond issuance at our Iowa utility and used part of the proceeds to call earlier a maturity that was due late this year. 
This deal was well received by the market and achieved a less bond interest rate in our higher utilities history. 
We will also use a portion of the remaining proceeds from the new bond issuance to make $110 million payment in September for the buyout of the [indiscernible] purchase power agreement. 
Our current liquidity is approximately $1.1 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. 
With no material debt maturities in 2021, we are well positioned to respond to any potential changes in objective cash flows. 
The key to achieving our updated carbon dioxide emission goals is expanding our use of clean energy resources. As John mentioned, we recently announced plans to retire 1 of our Wisconsin coal-fired generated facilities and to add 1,000 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin by the end of 2023. We recently filed a Certificate of Authority request for the first phase of construction, which includes 675 megawatts of new solar generation. 
As a result of this filing, we are planning to ship $350 million of capital expenditures into 2021 and 2022 that were originally forecast in 2023. The earlier timing of capital expenditures is based on our progress with development activities to date and the expected construction schedules. Our forecast also assumes 35% of the construction costs will be financed through tax equity partners. The contributions from the tax equity partners are [ current ] when the projects are placed in service. We expect to place 425 megawatts of solar into service in 2022 and 575 megawatts of the service in 2023. 
We plan to refresh our full future capital expenditure forecast and disclose our 2021 financing plans as part of our third quarter earnings release in November. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. As shown on the slide, our regulatory calendar for 2020 has many key milestones now behind us. The 1 noteworthy disclosure development since our last quarterly earnings call was the Wisconsin certificate of authority filing in late May for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. The filing is progressing as expected, and we are currently awaiting the procedural schedule. 
We are also encouraged by the progress on our 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal in Wisconsin. Comments recently filed by the innovating groups representing our retail customers include support for the proposal. The anticipated decision from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on our proposal later this quarter. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with you virtually over the coming months.

Thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020. I'll share a few notable stories from the quarter and then turn the call over to Robert as he recaps some of our regulatory, customer and financial highlights.  
I'll start my comments with a focus on our recently issued Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship as well as our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve.
On the environmental front, we were excited to announce that we achieved our 2030 goal of having 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources, 10 years ahead of schedule. And we're not stopping there. Our customer-focused strategy continues to advance us toward a clean-energy future. And our responsibility report has been updated with new and even more aggressive clean-energy goals. These new goals are shown on Slide 2 of the supplemental slides.  
Our report also highlights the great work of our employees to support our customers and communities. This is not new for Alliant Energy. It's part of how we do business. We've continued to support our customers and communities as they respond to the ongoing demands of the COVID-19 health and economic crisis. Our charitable foundation recently released a new wave of community grants, benefiting more than 230 nonprofit organizations across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our stated purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities is core to everything we do, and we're proud of the many ways we help to build stronger communities where we live, work and raise our families.  
Now more than ever, the social part of our corporate responsibility is at the forefront. We are committed to partnering with our communities, working to understand and help address their needs. We act by providing financial support to agencies and nonprofit organizations that help our communities bridge gaps of social inequities and through programs that support food and security and housing, workforce readiness, environmental stewardship and diversity, safety and wellbeing. Our employees and retirees are a driving force in our communities, and I'm very proud to be part of the company that lives our values in so many ways.  
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert, who will address the trends we are seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer bases as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Our employees have made great progress in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts during the first half of the year while keeping a strong focus on safety and reliability.  
Turning to the execution of our strategy, I'll highlight progress we've made as we advance our Clean Energy Vision. A key driver to achieving our goals is the continued successful advancement of new renewable energy source, wind and solar. In May, we filed a Certificate of Authority with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. Collectively, these solar projects are expected to create more than 1,200 local construction jobs and, once operational, will provide an estimated $80 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years.  
In conjunction with our solar filing, we also announced our plans to retire our Edgewater Generating Station. Our efforts to transition our generation to a cleaner and more efficient fleet are not new. In fact, we've been on this path for over a decade. As we have in the past, we will live our values to care for others and do the right thing as we support the transition of impacted employees in the Sheboygan community.  
The expansion of our Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio as well as the decision to retire the Edgewater facility was a result of a year-long process that involved working with key stakeholders and ultimately forming what we call our Clean Energy Blueprint. We have a similar process started in Iowa and expect to share the results of our Clean Energy Blueprint for our IPL business later this year.  
Speaking of Iowa, I'll also share that we recently announced an innovative partnership with the city of Decorah. The new project features a 2.5-megawatt battery storage facility to support distributed solar. This battery system will help us better serve the community and allow us to efficiently integrate a growing desire for distributed energy resources.  
And while a lot of great work is happening related to solar and energy storage, I also want to highlight American Wind Week, which kicks off next Monday. We are proud to be part of advancing wind energy and the many benefits it brings to our customers and rural communities.  
We remain on track to install an additional 280 megawatts of wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. Our 130-megawatt Richland wind farm will be completed by the end of the third quarter. And our 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm is 80% complete and will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the United States.  
To summarize, we remain committed to focusing on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision, ensuring our investments are well executed, efficient and customer-focused, and delivering consistent returns for our investors with a 5% to 7% growth rate and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.  
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base",1026,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base and higher electric margins from warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. We provided additional details on earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 3 and 4.  
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residential temperature-normalized sales increased 5% year-over-year, largely driven by our customers spending more time at home.  
On the other hand, commercial and industrial temperature-normalized sales declined 9%. Manufacturing sales, which make up approximately 50% of our commercial and industrial sales, were down 15% to 25% during April and May. And as expected, we saw material declines in electric sales in April and May to other sectors of our commercial and industrial customers, including retail, lodging and food service as a result of temporary business closures.  
More recently, we've been encouraged to see electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers rebound in June and July to levels that were only modestly lower than the same month last year. We are also fortunate to have a broad diversity of customers across our 2 state jurisdictions, but even saw certain customers, such as our food processing, packaging and warehouse customers, having flat to higher-than-normal sales at the initial months of the pandemic.  
With the faster-than-expected rebound in electric sales, we have updated our current projections to reflect an approximate 2% to 3% reduction in temperature-normalized electric sales for calendar year 2020 compared to last year. We have made significant progress mitigating this pandemic-related sales declines by accelerating planned cost transformation activities and reimagining how we do work. This is a direct reflection of our employees' leadership and dedication to reducing cost for our customers.  
I speak for the entire executive team in sharing my appreciation for the employees of Alliant Energy, especially for the men and women who are in the field each day, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of affordable energy to our customers throughout this pandemic. The health crisis has reaffirmed how essential energy services are to the country and a reminder of just how critical our purpose is to the communities and customers we serve.  
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 10% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits which flowed back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins, thereby resulting in no material impact on full year earnings.
The timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. This results in higher earnings in the first half of the year and lower earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the results of last year.  
On Slide 7, we have provided the details of our financial plan for 2020, which has now largely been completed. In June, we finalized a $400 million, 10-year bond issuance at our Iowa utility and used part of the proceeds to call early a maturity that was due later this year. This deal was well received by the market and achieved the lowest bond interest rate in our Iowa utility's history. We will also use a portion of the remaining proceeds from the new bond issuance to make $110 million payment in September for the buyout of the Duane Arnold purchase power agreement.  
Our current liquidity is approximately $1.1 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. With no material debt maturities in 2021, we are well positioned to respond to any potential changes in projected cash flows.  
The key to achieving our updated carbon dioxide emission goals is expanding our use of clean energy resources. As John mentioned, we recently announced plans to retire one of our Wisconsin coal-fired generator facilities and to add 1,000 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin by the end of 2023. We recently filed a Certificate of Authority request for the first phase of construction, which includes 675 megawatts of new solar generation. As a result of this filing, we are planning to ship $350 million of capital expenditures into 2021 and 2022 that were originally forecasted in 2023.
The earlier timing of capital expenditures is based on our progress with development activities to date and the expected construction schedules. Our forecast also assumes 35% of the construction costs will be financed through tax equity partners. The contributions from the tax equity partners are current when the projects are placed in service. We expect to place 425 megawatts of solar into service in 2022 and 575 megawatts of the service in 2023. 
We plan to refresh our full future capital expenditure forecast and disclose our 2021 financing plans as part of our third quarter earnings release in November. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. As shown on the slide, our regulatory calendar for 2020 has many key milestones now behind us. The one noteworthy disclosure development since our last quarterly earnings call was the Wisconsin Certificate of Authority filing in late May for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. The filing is progressing as expected, and we are currently awaiting the procedural schedule. 
We are also encouraged by the progress on our 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal in Wisconsin. Comments recently filed by the innovating groups representing our retail customers include support for the proposal. We anticipate a decision from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on our proposal later this quarter. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with all of you virtually over the coming months. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

But I think we have a solid track record of working with the regulators and putting a very solid plan that makes sense for customers or we wouldn't file that. So I'd say we feel comfortable with that filing, but some of those are yet to be determined."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2020. I want to start by saying how proud I am to be part of the Alliant Energy team. Our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities has guided us throughout the year and the events of this quarter. 2020 has highlighted the importance of resiliency as we face the challenges of the pandemic and the Derecho windstorm in Iowa. 
But resiliency is not new for us. Our customer-focused strategy is designed with both resiliency and flexibility in mind. On August 10, just a few days after our second quarter call, our teams [indiscernible] resiliency as they responded to an unprecedented storm that impacted 341 of the nearly 700 communities we serve in Iowa. 
The windstorm, known as the Derecho, hit with little warning, leaving more than half of our Iowa customers about power. This was the biggest storm in our company's 100-plus year history. Our dedicated employees, many of whom were without power were assisted by crews from across the country in Canada, working day in and day out for more than 2 weeks until every customer had power available to them. 
I also want to recognize the kindness and resiliency of our Iowa customers during this time. Our employees were overwhelmed with the kindness and patient expressed to them throughout the restoration process. Our resiliency extended to our social commitments to our customers. 
In partnership with our employees, we started project Reconnect. A program to help homeowners make costly repairs for their residences after the storm. To date, Alliant Energy, along with our employees, have donated more than $300,000 to project Reconnect. It's one more way that our values to do the right thing and care for others make a difference in the communities we call home. 
We remain flexible to assist those in need beyond the borders of our service territory as well. Over the weekend, nearly 200 Alliant Energy employees left home to help restore power following Hurricane Zeta in Gulfport, Mississippi where they'll be joined by mutual aid crews from several other states to help get the lights back on. 
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert who will address the sales trends we are seeing as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. I'm proud of the efforts our employees have made in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts, helping us offset expenses from the storm as well as the pandemic and resulting in lower cost for customers in 2020 compared to 2019. 
Turning to the execution of our strategy. We recently announced the on-time and on-budget completion of our $2 billion wind expansion in Iowa. Our generation translation started over a decade ago and required thoughtful planning, flexibility and solid execution. And that's just [indiscernible] been, making us now the third largest regulated wind owner-operator in the country. 
We take pride in our sustainable construction practices, delivering a range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the communities we serve. Continuing our purpose-driven strategy and building on our strong track record of project execution, last week we announced the next phase of our clean energy expansion in Iowa as part of our Clean Energy Blueprint. The Blueprint offers clarity about the generation plans in Iowa through our 2020 to 2024 planning horizon. The Blueprint aligns with our consumer preferences for more renewable energy includes adding up to 400 megawatts of solar by 2023. Our near-term investments in renewables creates long-term savings for customers. 
When the 400 megawatts of solar is combined with the nearly 1,300 megawatts of owned and operated wind plus the power generated by our existing solar farms in Dubuque, Marshalltown and Cedar Rapids, nearly 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa Generation portfolio will be from renewables. We also announced our intent to retire our Lansing Generating Station by the end of 2022, and the coal to natural gas conversion of our Burlington Generating Station. These plans will allow us to avoid significant investments and helps to advance toward our goal of eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040. 
These retirements also bring the end of an era for our employees at these facilities. For decades, our employees have done an outstanding job, safely maintaining and efficiently operating these plants, providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. We will continue to live our values by caring for our employees and assisting the impacted communities throughout the transition. The Iowa Blueprint builds upon our Clean Energy strategy, including plans to add up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy, such as community solar and energy store systems. Our Clean Energy Vision is more than renewables. It's a comprehensive view of the energy ecosystem, recognizing the changing needs of our customers and advancing investments in our connected energy network, prioritizes reliability, resiliency and customer affordability. These investments include transitioning our grid from overhead to underground, deploying technologies such as ADMS, maximizing the use of our AMI system and advancing high-speed fiber communications. And of course, we'll continue our efforts to retain and attract customers, driving economic development through a variety of projects and partnerships. 
In the face of this unprecedented year, our teams have embodied resiliency and flexibility as they delivered results. For the second year in a row, we've been recognized as a top utility for economic development by [ Site Selector ] magazine. Our teams have also secured 19 new projects across our service territory and helping to create more than 1,700 new jobs. These developments are good news for our customers and communities and another example of our purpose in motion. 
In closing, I'm pleased to share our forecast for our tenth year in a row of 5% to 7% earnings growth, our increased and narrowed 2020 earnings guidance range between $2.40 per share and $2.46 per share, our 2021 earnings guidance range between $2.50 per share and $2.64 per share. And in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend of $1.61 per share. 
We remain committed to our purpose-driven strategy, the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision and delivering consistent returns for our investors. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."

Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due",1266,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, the timing of income tax expense and a favorable $0.04 adjustment to the credit loss liability related to lessee guarantees in our nonutility business. 
These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and equity dilution. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Pages 3 and 4 on the supplemental slides. 
In the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. By comparison in 2019, the year-to-date temperature impacts for the first 3 quarters increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share. 
Turning to temperature normalized sales. We've been very encouraged by the improvement we've seen in our sales when comparing the second quarter to the third quarter this year. 
I would characterize our current sales levels will be roughly flat versus the same period in 2019, with the increase in residential sales, offsetting the decreases seen in commercial and industrial sales. It's important to note that our third quarter results also reflected the impacts of the August 10 Derecho storm in Iowa, which caused a temporary reduction in sales as we look for a couple of weeks to restore power to our customers in Central Iowa. 
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. The key drivers of the [ 6% ] midpoint growth in temperature normalized EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's Kossuth wind farm and the Western Wisconsin Gas Pipeline and IPL -- sorry, wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 as part of our rate stabilization program and IPL's approved electric rates that were implemented in February of this year. 
Our 2021 guidance also reflects additional earnings at IPL related to wind generation of the [ limited service ] in September, which will be captured in IPL's renewable energy writer and the DAC PPA buyout payments in the third quarter, which we captured in IPL's fuel rider. The details of our updated capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 5. Included in this plan are a total of 1.4 gigawatts of solar generation, up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy such as community solar and battery storage, and nearly $3 billion of investments into our electric distribution system. 
As noted on the slide, we plan to finance our solar investments with tax equity funding. So we anticipate approximately $700 million in contributions for our solar projects from tax equity partners. On Slide 6, we provided a [ walk ] from last year's capital expenditure plan to this year's plan. We've [indiscernible] renewables expenditures into the next 2 years, which were originally forecasted in 2023 and also increased renewable expenditures in total over the 5-year period. 
These changes reflect the better-than-expected development progress with the solar sites we have acquired for our Wisconsin customers. And the addition of 400 megawatts of [ Iowa ] Solar John mentioned earlier. 
Slide 7 has been provided to assist remodeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 9% for 2020, a negative 14% for 2021. Additional production tax credits from the [indiscernible] projects placed into service in 2020 and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. 
The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral. Next, I'd like to highlight our continued commitment and focus on controlling costs for our customers. 
In September of this year, our Iowa Utility paid $110 million to terminate the Duane Arnold PPA 5 years early. This strategic decision will lead to a medium and substantial fuel cost savings for our customers. Additionally, we have and will continue to make investments in technology that will further reduce costs for our customers. 
A great example of this is our AMI investment in Iowa jurisdiction completed earlier this year that reduced O&M costs associated with meter reading. We are also pursuing additional technology investments that reduce O&M costs, such as our advanced distribution management system. I want to recognize the efforts of our employees. For. The hard work they're putting into cost transformation efforts on behalf of our customers. In this content, our rate utilization proposal earlier this year was recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. This is a win-win for the utility and for our customers as we're able to begin recovery of many previously approved projects such as our Kossuth wind farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, while leveraging fuel savings and excess deferred income taxes, to keep base rates in 2021 flat for our customers. Our utility customers in both states are benefiting from lower transmission costs, lower taxes from federal tax reform, lower fuel costs and tax credits associated with more renewable generation; and finally, lower O&M expenses. 
Let's move next to our financing plans for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. Our plans include approximately $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan in 2021. Our financing plans also include new long-term debt over the next 14 months, including up to $300 million at our Wisconsin utility and up to $300 million of Alliant Energy Finance. And finally, there are no long-term debt maturities between now and the end of 2021. 
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. For this year, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate stabilization plan yet this quarter, including the final fuel cost recovery amounts for 2021. Next year, in Iowa, we plan to make an advanced [indiscernible] filing for our planned 400 megawatts of new solar generation as well as a filing for the subsequent proceeding required as part of our test year 2020 retail electric and gas rate review. Both of these filings are anticipated in the first half of next year. And in this content, we anticipate decision from the PCW regarding our first certificate of authority filing for sole generation by the second quarter. We also want to make the second CA filing to round out our planned 1 gigawatt of Wisconsin solar in the first half of the year. 
Lastly, in the second quarter of 2021, we plan to file a retail electric and gas rig review in Wisconsin. At this time, we are still evaluating whether there would be a single test year case or multiple test years. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results. We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the virtual EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the [ EM ] investor presentation and the November 2020 Factbook, which detailed the IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base and construction work in progress forecast through 2024. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And so we'll continue to work on those areas as we look into 2021 and look at all parts of the organization. And it went really some changes to drive cost efficiencies throughout our business. I'm really excited about a lot of new technology opportunities for us to drive those expense reductions.

At this point, we haven't quantified it, but there was some sales impact, as we alluded to earlier. Think of that as probably about a $0.02 decrease in the third quarter related to just the sales impact. The remaining portions of the restoration costs, we're expecting to get recovery of those costs. And so we've actually capitalized lows. And we're also seeking -- later today, we'll be finally a deferral request for any of the operating expenses as well as the offsetting tax benefits associated with the storm. So so beyond sales impact, it was about negative $0.02, we're not expecting anything else material."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2020. I want to start by saying how proud I am to be part of the Alliant Energy team. Our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities has guided us throughout the year and the events of this quarter. 2020 has highlighted the importance of resiliency as we face the challenges of the pandemic and the derecho windstorm in Iowa. But resiliency is not new for us. Our customer-focused strategy is designed with both resiliency and flexibility in mind. On August 10, just a few days after our second quarter call, our teams with a picture of resiliency as they responded to an unprecedented storm that impacted 341 of the nearly 700 communities we serve in Iowa.
The windstorm, known as the derecho, hit with little warning, leaving more than half of our Iowa customers without power. This was the biggest storm in our company's 100-plus-year history. Our dedicated employees, many of whom were without power, were assisted by crews from across the country in Canada, working day in and day out for more than 2 weeks until every customer had power available to them. I also want to recognize the kindness and resiliency of our Iowa customers during this time. Our employees were overwhelmed with the kindness and patience expressed to them throughout the restoration process.
Our resiliency extended to our social commitments to our customers. In partnership with our employees, we started Project ReConnect, a program to help homeowners make costly repairs to their residences after the storm. To date, Alliant Energy, along with our employees, have donated more than $300,000 to Project ReConnect. It's one more way that our values to do the right thing and care for others make a difference in the communities we call home.
We remain flexible to assist those in need beyond the borders of our service territory as well. Over the weekend, nearly 200 Alliant Energy employees left home to help restore power following Hurricane Zeta in Gulfport, Mississippi where they'll be joined by mutual aid crews from several other states to help get the lights back on.
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert who will address the sales trends we are seeing as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. I'm proud of the efforts our employees have made in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts, helping us offset expenses from the storm as well as the pandemic and resulting in lower cost for customers in 2020 compared to 2019.
Turning to the execution of our strategy. We recently announced the on-time and on-budget completion of our $2 billion wind expansion in Iowa. Our generation transformation started over a decade ago and required thoughtful planning, flexibility and solid execution. And that's just what we did making us now the third largest regulated wind owner-operator in the country. And we take pride in our sustainable construction practices, delivering a range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the communities we serve.
Continuing our purpose-driven strategy and building on our strong track record of project execution, last week we announced the next phase of our clean energy expansion in Iowa as part of our Clean Energy Blueprint. The Blueprint offers clarity about the generation plans in Iowa through our 2020 to 2024 planning horizon. The Blueprint aligns with our consumer preferences for more renewable energy includes adding up to 400 megawatts of solar by 2023. Our near-term investments in renewables creates long-term savings for customers. When the 400 megawatts of solar is combined with the nearly 1,300 megawatts of owned and operated wind plus the power generated by existing solar farms in Dubuque, Marshalltown and Cedar Rapids, nearly 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa Generation portfolio will be from renewables.
We also announced our intent to retire our Lansing Generating Station by the end of 2022, and the coal to natural gas conversion of our Burlington Generating Station. These plans will allow us to avoid significant investments and helps to advance toward our goal of eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040. These retirements also bring the end of an era for our employees at these facilities. For decades, our employees have done an outstanding job, safely maintaining and efficiently operating these plants, providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. We will continue to live our values by caring for our employees and assisting the impacted communities throughout the transition.
The Iowa Blueprint builds upon our Clean Energy strategy, including plans to add up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy, such as community solar and energy store systems. Our Clean Energy Vision is more than renewables. It's a comprehensive view of the energy ecosystem, recognizing the changing needs of our customers and advancing investments in our connected energy network, which prioritizes reliability, resiliency and customer affordability. These investments include transitioning our grid from overhead to underground, deploying technologies such as ADMS, maximizing the use of our AMI system and advancing high-speed fiber communications. And of course, we'll continue our efforts to retain and attract customers, driving economic development through a variety of projects and partnerships.
In the face of this unprecedented year, our teams have embodied resiliency and flexibility as they've delivered results. For the second year in a row, we've been recognized as a top utility for economic development by Site Selector magazine. Our teams have also secured 19 new projects across our service territory and helping to create more than 1,700 new jobs. These developments are good news for our customers and communities and another example of our purpose in motion.
In closing, I'm pleased to share our forecast for our tenth year in a row of 5% to 7% earnings growth, our increased and narrowed 2020 earnings guidance range between $2.40 per share and $2.46 per share, our 2021 earnings guidance range between $2.50 per share and $2.64 per share and in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend of $1.61 per share.
We remain committed to our purpose-driven strategy, the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision and delivering consistent returns for our investors.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,692500580,2127255,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due",1261,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, the timing of income tax expense and the favorable $0.04 adjustment to the credit loss liability related to legacy guarantees in our nonutility business. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and equity dilution. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Pages 3 and 4 on the supplemental slides.
In the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. By comparison in 2019, the year-to-date temperature impacts for the first 3 quarters increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share.
Turning to temperature normalized sales. We've been very encouraged by the improvement we've seen in our sales when comparing the second quarter to the third quarter this year. I would characterize our current sales levels will be roughly flat versus the same period in 2019, with the increase in residential sales, offsetting the decreases seen in commercial and industrial sales.
It's important to note that our third quarter results also reflected the impacts of the August 10 derecho storm in Iowa, which caused a temporary reduction in sales as we look for a couple of weeks to restore power to our customers in Central Iowa.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. The key drivers of the 6% midpoint growth in temperature normalized EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin Gas Pipeline and IPL's West -- sorry, wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 as part of our rate stabilization program and IPL's approved electric rates that were implemented in February of this year.
Our 2021 guidance also reflects additional earnings at IPL related to wind generation of the limited service in September, which will be captured in IPL's renewable energy rider and the DAEC PPA buyout payments in the third quarter, which we captured in IPL's fuel rider.
The details of our updated capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 5. Included in this plan are a total of 1.4 gigawatts of solar generation, up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy such as community solar and battery storage, and nearly $3 billion of investments into our electric distribution system. As noted on the slide, we plan to finance our solar investments with tax equity funding. So we anticipate approximately $700 million in contributions for our solar projects from tax equity partners.
On Slide 6, we provided a walk from last year's capital expenditure plan to this year's plan. We've accelerated renewables expenditures into the next 2 years, which were originally forecasted in 2023 and also increased renewable expenditures in total over the 5-year period. These changes reflect the better-than-expected development progress with the solar sites we have acquired for our Wisconsin customers and the addition of 400 megawatts of Iowa Solar John mentioned earlier.
Slide 7 has been provided to assist remodeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 9% for 2020 and negative 14% for 2021. Additional production tax credits from the new wind projects placed into service in 2020 and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
Next, I'd like to highlight our continued commitment and focus on controlling costs for our customers. In September of this year, our Iowa utility paid $110 million to terminate the Duane Arnold PPA 5 years early. This strategic decision will lead to a medium and substantial fuel cost savings for our customers. Additionally, we have and will continue to make investments in technology that will further reduce costs for our customers.
A great example of this is our AMI investment in Iowa jurisdiction completed earlier this year that reduced O&M costs associated with meter reading. We are also pursuing additional technology investments to reduce O&M costs, such as our advanced distribution management system. I want to recognize the great efforts of our employees for the hard work they're putting into cost transformation efforts on behalf of our customers.
In this content, our rates utilization proposal earlier this year was recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. This is a win-win for the utility and for our customers as we're able to begin recovery of many previously approved projects such as our Kossuth wind farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, while leveraging fuel savings and excess deferred income taxes to keep base rates in 2021 flat for our customers.
Our utility customers in both states are benefiting from lower transmission costs, lower taxes from federal tax reform, lower fuel costs and tax credits associated with more renewable generation; and finally, lower O&M expenses.
Let's move next to our financing plans for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. Our plans include approximately $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan in 2021. Our financing plans also include new long-term debt over the next 14 months, including up to $300 million at our Wisconsin utility and up to $300 million of Alliant Energy Finance. And finally, there are no long-term debt maturities between now and the end of 2021.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. For this year, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate stabilization plan yet this quarter, including the final fuel cost recovery amounts for 2021. Next year, in Iowa, we plan to make an advanced rate-making principles filing for our planned 400 megawatts of new solar generation as well as a filing for the subsequent proceeding required as part of our test year 2020 retail, electric and gas rate review. Both of these filings are anticipated in the first half of next year. And in this content, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW regarding our first certificate of authority filing for solar generation by the second quarter. We also plan to make the second CA filing to round out our planned 1 gigawatt of Wisconsin solar in the first half of the year.
Lastly, in the second quarter of 2021, we plan to file a retail electric and gas rig review in Wisconsin. At this time, we are still evaluating whether there would be a single test year case or multiple test years. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the virtual EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2020 Factbook, which detailed the IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base and construction work in progress forecast through 2024.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as you know, the midpoint is where we spend a lot of time making sure we have a plan to get solidly within that range and we'll continue to.

And as we've shared with you and others, we do have some plans for increasing our T&D spend overhead to underground. As Robert and I both mentioned, you'd see a little bit of that in the tail end in 2024.
There's some great T&D spend yet. So as you know, we try to have that $1.2 to $1.4 billion per year is a really good spot for us to maintain the 5% to 7% minimal equity needs and keeping customer costs affordable. So we really like the CapEx plan and I would say there's some great T&D spend that we continue to look at, and we'll just let capital compete as we always do, Julien. Thanks for the question."

The other half is largely related to our ability to manage costs and to accelerate some of the transformation activities for future sustainable savings.
And so we'll continue to work on those areas as we look into 2021 and look at all parts of the organization and implement really some changes to drive cost efficiencies throughout our business. I'm really excited about a lot of new technology opportunities for us to drive those expense reductions. And we're also operating with a lot of fewer employees by not backfilling certain vacated positions. So I think our efforts in 2019 really helped us position us well for 2020 and looking forward to the rest of this year position us really well for next year for 2021."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2020. I want to start by saying how proud I am to be part of the Alliant Energy team. Our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities has guided us throughout the year and the events of this quarter. 2020 has highlighted the importance of resiliency as we face the challenges of the pandemic and the derecho windstorm in Iowa. But resiliency is not new for us. Our customer-focused strategy is designed with both resiliency and flexibility in mind. On August 10, just a few days after our second quarter call, our teams with a picture of resiliency as they responded to an unprecedented storm that impacted 341 of the nearly 700 communities we serve in Iowa.
The windstorm, known as the derecho, hit with little warning, leaving more than half of our Iowa customers without power. This was the biggest storm in our company's 100-plus-year history. Our dedicated employees, many of whom were without power, were assisted by crews from across the country in Canada, working day in and day out for more than 2 weeks until every customer had power available to them. I also want to recognize the kindness and resiliency of our Iowa customers during this time. Our employees were overwhelmed with the kindness and patience expressed to them throughout the restoration process.
Our resiliency extended to our social commitments to our customers. In partnership with our employees, we started Project ReConnect, a program to help homeowners make costly repairs to their residences after the storm. To date, Alliant Energy, along with our employees, have donated more than $300,000 to Project ReConnect. It's one more way that our values to do the right thing and care for others make a difference in the communities we call home.
We remain flexible to assist those in need beyond the borders of our service territory as well. Over the weekend, nearly 200 Alliant Energy employees left home to help restore power following Hurricane Zeta in Gulfport, Mississippi where they'll be joined by mutual aid crews from several other states to help get the lights back on.
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert who will address the sales trends we are seeing as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. I'm proud of the efforts our employees have made in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts, helping us offset expenses from the storm as well as the pandemic and resulting in lower cost for customers in 2020 compared to 2019.
Turning to the execution of our strategy. We recently announced the on-time and on-budget completion of our $2 billion wind expansion in Iowa. Our generation transformation started over a decade ago and required thoughtful planning, flexibility and solid execution. And that's just what we did making us now the third largest regulated wind owner-operator in the country. And we take pride in our sustainable construction practices, delivering a range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the communities we serve.
Continuing our purpose-driven strategy and building on our strong track record of project execution, last week we announced the next phase of our clean energy expansion in Iowa as part of our Clean Energy Blueprint. The Blueprint offers clarity about the generation plans in Iowa through our 2020 to 2024 planning horizon. The Blueprint aligns with our consumer preferences for more renewable energy includes adding up to 400 megawatts of solar by 2023. Our near-term investments in renewables creates long-term savings for customers. When the 400 megawatts of solar is combined with the nearly 1,300 megawatts of owned and operated wind plus the power generated by existing solar farms in Dubuque, Marshalltown and Cedar Rapids, nearly 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa Generation portfolio will be from renewables.
We also announced our intent to retire our Lansing Generating Station by the end of 2022, and the coal to natural gas conversion of our Burlington Generating Station. These plans will allow us to avoid significant investments and helps to advance toward our goal of eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040. These retirements also bring the end of an era for our employees at these facilities. For decades, our employees have done an outstanding job, safely maintaining and efficiently operating these plants, providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. We will continue to live our values by caring for our employees and assisting the impacted communities throughout the transition.
The Iowa Blueprint builds upon our Clean Energy strategy, including plans to add up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy, such as community solar and energy store systems. Our Clean Energy Vision is more than renewables. It's a comprehensive view of the energy ecosystem, recognizing the changing needs of our customers and advancing investments in our connected energy network, which prioritizes reliability, resiliency and customer affordability. These investments include transitioning our grid from overhead to underground, deploying technologies such as ADMS, maximizing the use of our AMI system and advancing high-speed fiber communications. And of course, we'll continue our efforts to retain and attract customers, driving economic development through a variety of projects and partnerships.
In the face of this unprecedented year, our teams have embodied resiliency and flexibility as they've delivered results. For the second year in a row, we've been recognized as a top utility for economic development by Site Selector magazine. Our teams have also secured 19 new projects across our service territory and helping to create more than 1,700 new jobs. These developments are good news for our customers and communities and another example of our purpose in motion.
In closing, I'm pleased to share our forecast for our tenth year in a row of 5% to 7% earnings growth, our increased and narrowed 2020 earnings guidance range between $2.40 per share and $2.46 per share, our 2021 earnings guidance range between $2.50 per share and $2.64 per share and in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend of $1.61 per share.
We remain committed to our purpose-driven strategy, the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision and delivering consistent returns for our investors.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,692500580,2157543,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due",1261,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, the timing of income tax expense and the favorable $0.04 adjustment to the credit loss liability related to legacy guarantees in our nonutility business. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and equity dilution. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Pages 3 and 4 on the supplemental slides.
In the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. By comparison in 2019, the year-to-date temperature impacts for the first 3 quarters increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share.
Turning to temperature normalized sales. We've been very encouraged by the improvement we've seen in our sales when comparing the second quarter to the third quarter this year. I would characterize our current sales levels will be roughly flat versus the same period in 2019, with the increase in residential sales, offsetting the decreases seen in commercial and industrial sales.
It's important to note that our third quarter results also reflected the impacts of the August 10 derecho storm in Iowa, which caused a temporary reduction in sales as we look for a couple of weeks to restore power to our customers in Central Iowa.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. The key drivers of the 6% midpoint growth in temperature normalized EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin Gas Pipeline and IPL's West -- sorry, wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 as part of our rate stabilization program and IPL's approved electric rates that were implemented in February of this year.
Our 2021 guidance also reflects additional earnings at IPL related to wind generation of the limited service in September, which will be captured in IPL's renewable energy rider and the DAEC PPA buyout payments in the third quarter, which we captured in IPL's fuel rider.
The details of our updated capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 5. Included in this plan are a total of 1.4 gigawatts of solar generation, up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy such as community solar and battery storage and nearly $3 billion of investments into our electric distribution system. As noted on the slide, we plan to finance our solar investments with tax equity funding. So we anticipate approximately $700 million in contributions for our solar projects from tax equity partners.
On Slide 6, we provided a walk from last year's capital expenditure plan to this year's plan. We've accelerated renewables expenditures into the next 2 years, which were originally forecasted in 2023 and also increased renewable expenditures in total over the 5-year period. These changes reflect the better-than-expected development progress with the solar sites we have acquired for our Wisconsin customers and the addition of 400 megawatts of Iowa Solar John mentioned earlier.
Slide 7 has been provided to assist remodeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 9% for 2020 and negative 14% for 2021. Additional production tax credits from the new wind projects placed into service in 2020 and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
Next, I'd like to highlight our continued commitment and focus on controlling costs for our customers. In September of this year, our Iowa utility paid $110 million to terminate the Duane Arnold PPA 5 years early. This strategic decision will lead to a medium and substantial fuel cost savings for our customers. Additionally, we have and will continue to make investments in technology that will further reduce costs for our customers.
A great example of this is our AMI investment in Iowa jurisdiction completed earlier this year that reduced O&M costs associated with meter reading. We are also pursuing additional technology investments to reduce O&M costs, such as our advanced distribution management system. I want to recognize the great efforts of our employees for the hard work they're putting into cost transformation efforts on behalf of our customers.
In this content, our rates utilization proposal earlier this year was recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. This is a win-win for the utility and for our customers as we're able to begin recovery of many previously approved projects such as our Kossuth wind farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, while leveraging fuel savings and excess deferred income taxes to keep base rates in 2021 flat for our customers.
Our utility customers in both states are benefiting from lower transmission costs, lower taxes from federal tax reform, lower fuel costs and tax credits associated with more renewable generation; and finally, lower O&M expenses.
Let's move next to our financing plans for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. Our plans include approximately $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan in 2021. Our financing plans also include new long-term debt over the next 14 months, including up to $300 million at our Wisconsin utility and up to $300 million of Alliant Energy Finance. And finally, there are no long-term debt maturities between now and the end of 2021.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. For this year, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate stabilization plan yet this quarter, including the final fuel cost recovery amounts for 2021. Next year, in Iowa, we plan to make an advanced rate-making principles filing for our planned 400 megawatts of new solar generation as well as a filing for the subsequent proceeding required as part of our test year 2020 retail, electric and gas rate review. Both of these filings are anticipated in the first half of next year. And in this content, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW regarding our first certificate of authority filing for solar generation by the second quarter. We also plan to make the second CA filing to round out our planned 1 gigawatt of Wisconsin solar in the first half of the year.
Lastly, in the second quarter of 2021, we plan to file a retail electric and gas rig review in Wisconsin. At this time, we are still evaluating whether there would be a single test year case or multiple test years. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the virtual EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2020 Factbook, which detailed the IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base and construction work in progress forecast through 2024.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as you know, the midpoint is where we spend a lot of time making sure we have a plan to get solidly within that range and we'll continue to.

And as we've shared with you and others, we do have some plans for increasing our T&D spend overhead to underground. As Robert and I both mentioned, you'd see a little bit of that in the tail end in 2024.
There's some great T&D spend yet. So as you know, we try to have that $1.2 to $1.4 billion per year is a really good spot for us to maintain the 5% to 7% minimal equity needs and keeping customer costs affordable. So we really like the CapEx plan and I would say there's some great T&D spend that we continue to look at and we'll just let capital compete as we always do, Julien. Thanks for the question."

The other half is largely related to our ability to manage costs and to accelerate some of the transformation activities for future sustainable savings.
And so we'll continue to work on those areas as we look into 2021 and look at all parts of the organization and implement really some changes to drive cost efficiencies throughout our business. I'm really excited about a lot of new technology opportunities for us to drive those expense reductions. And we're also operating with a lot of fewer employees by not backfilling certain vacated positions.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the third quarter of 2020. I want to start by saying how proud I am to be part of the Alliant Energy team. Our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities has guided us throughout the year and the events of this quarter. 2020 has highlighted the importance of resiliency as we face the challenges of the pandemic and the derecho windstorm in Iowa. But resiliency is not new for us. Our customer-focused strategy is designed with both resiliency and flexibility in mind. On August 10, just a few days after our second quarter call, our teams with a picture of resiliency as they responded to an unprecedented storm that impacted 341 of the nearly 700 communities we serve in Iowa.
The windstorm, known as the derecho, hit with little warning, leaving more than half of our Iowa customers without power. This was the biggest storm in our company's 100-plus-year history. Our dedicated employees, many of whom were without power, were assisted by crews from across the country in Canada, working day in and day out for more than 2 weeks until every customer had power available to them. I also want to recognize the kindness and resiliency of our Iowa customers during this time. Our employees were overwhelmed with the kindness and patience expressed to them throughout the restoration process.
Our resiliency extended to our social commitments to our customers. In partnership with our employees, we started Project ReConnect, a program to help homeowners make costly repairs to their residences after the storm. To date, Alliant Energy, along with our employees, have donated more than $300,000 to Project ReConnect. It's one more way that our values to do the right thing and care for others make a difference in the communities we call home.
We remain flexible to assist those in need beyond the borders of our service territory as well. Over the weekend, nearly 200 Alliant Energy employees left home to help restore power following Hurricane Zeta in Gulfport, Mississippi where they'll be joined by mutual aid crews from several other states to help get the lights back on.
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert who will address the sales trends we are seeing as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. I'm proud of the efforts our employees have made in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts, helping us offset expenses from the storm as well as the pandemic and resulting in lower cost for customers in 2020 compared to 2019.
Turning to the execution of our strategy. We recently announced the on-time and on-budget completion of our $2 billion wind expansion in Iowa. Our generation transformation started over a decade ago and required thoughtful planning, flexibility and solid execution. And that's just what we did making us now the third largest regulated wind owner-operator in the country. And we take pride in our sustainable construction practices, delivering a range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the communities we serve.
Continuing our purpose-driven strategy and building on our strong track record of project execution, last week we announced the next phase of our clean energy expansion in Iowa as part of our Clean Energy Blueprint. The Blueprint offers clarity about the generation plans in Iowa through our 2020 to 2024 planning horizon. The Blueprint aligns with our consumer preferences for more renewable energy includes adding up to 400 megawatts of solar by 2023. Our near-term investments in renewables creates long-term savings for customers. When the 400 megawatts of solar is combined with the nearly 1,300 megawatts of owned and operated wind plus the power generated by existing solar farms in Dubuque, Marshalltown and Cedar Rapids, nearly 50% of Alliant Energy's Iowa Generation portfolio will be from renewables.
We also announced our intent to retire our Lansing Generating Station by the end of 2022, and the coal to natural gas conversion of our Burlington Generating Station. These plans will allow us to avoid significant investments and helps to advance toward our goal of eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040. These retirements also bring the end of an era for our employees at these facilities. For decades, our employees have done an outstanding job, safely maintaining and efficiently operating these plants, providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. We will continue to live our values by caring for our employees and assisting the impacted communities throughout the transition.
The Iowa Blueprint builds upon our Clean Energy strategy, including plans to add up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy, such as community solar and energy store systems. Our Clean Energy Vision is more than renewables. It's a comprehensive view of the energy ecosystem, recognizing the changing needs of our customers and advancing investments in our connected energy network, which prioritizes reliability, resiliency and customer affordability. These investments include transitioning our grid from overhead to underground, deploying technologies such as ADMS, maximizing the use of our AMI system and advancing high-speed fiber communications. And of course, we'll continue our efforts to retain and attract customers, driving economic development through a variety of projects and partnerships.
In the face of this unprecedented year, our teams have embodied resiliency and flexibility as they've delivered results. For the second year in a row, we've been recognized as a top utility for economic development by Site Selector magazine. Our teams have also secured 19 new projects across our service territory and helping to create more than 1,700 new jobs. These developments are good news for our customers and communities and another example of our purpose in motion.
In closing, I'm pleased to share our forecast for our tenth year in a row of 5% to 7% earnings growth, our increased and narrowed 2020 earnings guidance range between $2.40 per share and $2.46 per share, our 2021 earnings guidance range between $2.50 per share and $2.64 per share and in keeping with our plan to grow dividends commensurate with earnings growth, our Board of Directors has approved a 6% increase in our targeted annual common stock dividend of $1.61 per share.
We remain committed to our purpose-driven strategy, the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision and delivering consistent returns for our investors.
I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,692500580,2157545,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2020",2020-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due",1261,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the third quarter last year. Our higher earnings year-over-year were driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base, the timing of income tax expense and the favorable $0.04 adjustment to the credit loss liability related to legacy guarantees in our nonutility business. These higher earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation and equity dilution. We provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Pages 3 and 4 on the supplemental slides.
In the first 9 months of this year, temperatures in our service territory have increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.01 per share. By comparison in 2019, the year-to-date temperature impacts for the first 3 quarters increased retail, electric and gas margins by approximately $0.05 per share.
Turning to temperature normalized sales. We've been very encouraged by the improvement we've seen in our sales when comparing the second quarter to the third quarter this year. I would characterize our current sales levels will be roughly flat versus the same period in 2019, with the increase in residential sales, offsetting the decreases seen in commercial and industrial sales.
It's important to note that our third quarter results also reflected the impacts of the August 10 derecho storm in Iowa, which caused a temporary reduction in sales as we look for a couple of weeks to restore power to our customers in Central Iowa.
As John mentioned, last night, we issued our consolidated 2021 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $2.64 per share. The key drivers of the 6% midpoint growth in temperature normalized EPS are related to investments in our core utility business, including WPL's Kossuth Wind Farm and the Western Wisconsin Gas Pipeline and IPL's West -- sorry, wind expansion program. These investments were reflected in WPL's approved electric rates for 2021 as part of our rate stabilization program and IPL's approved electric rates that were implemented in February of this year.
Our 2021 guidance also reflects additional earnings at IPL related to wind generation of the limited service in September, which will be captured in IPL's renewable energy rider and the DAEC PPA buyout payments in the third quarter, which we captured in IPL's fuel rider.
The details of our updated capital expenditure plan are shown on Slide 5. Included in this plan are a total of 1.4 gigawatts of solar generation, up to 100 megawatts of distributed energy such as community solar and battery storage and nearly $3 billion of investments into our electric distribution system. As noted on the slide, we plan to finance our solar investments with tax equity funding. So we anticipate approximately $700 million in contributions for our solar projects from tax equity partners.
On Slide 6, we provided a walk from last year's capital expenditure plan to this year's plan. We've accelerated renewables expenditures into the next 2 years, which were originally forecasted in 2023 and also increased renewable expenditures in total over the 5-year period. These changes reflect the better-than-expected development progress with the solar sites we have acquired for our Wisconsin customers and the addition of 400 megawatts of Iowa Solar John mentioned earlier.
Slide 7 has been provided to assist remodeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 9% for 2020 and negative 14% for 2021. Additional production tax credits from the new wind projects placed into service in 2020 and the excess deferred taxes being returned to customers in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decrease in the effective tax rate. The production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins next year. Thus, the decreases in the effective tax rate related to PTCs and excess deferred tax benefits are largely earnings neutral.
Next, I'd like to highlight our continued commitment and focus on controlling costs for our customers. In September of this year, our Iowa utility paid $110 million to terminate the Duane Arnold PPA 5 years early. This strategic decision will lead to a medium and substantial fuel cost savings for our customers. Additionally, we have and will continue to make investments in technology that will further reduce costs for our customers.
A great example of this is our AMI investment in Iowa jurisdiction completed earlier this year that reduced O&M costs associated with meter reading. We are also pursuing additional technology investments to reduce O&M costs, such as our advanced distribution management system. I want to recognize the great efforts of our employees for the hard work they're putting into cost transformation efforts on behalf of our customers.
In this content, our rates utilization proposal earlier this year was recently approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. This is a win-win for the utility and for our customers as we're able to begin recovery of many previously approved projects such as our Kossuth wind farm and the Western Wisconsin pipeline, while leveraging fuel savings and excess deferred income taxes to keep base rates in 2021 flat for our customers.
Our utility customers in both states are benefiting from lower transmission costs, lower taxes from federal tax reform, lower fuel costs and tax credits associated with more renewable generation; and finally, lower O&M expenses.
Let's move next to our financing plans for the remainder of 2020 and 2021. Our plans include approximately $25 million of new common equity through our DRIP plan in 2021. Our financing plans also include new long-term debt over the next 14 months, including up to $300 million at our Wisconsin utility and up to $300 million of Alliant Energy Finance. And finally, there are no long-term debt maturities between now and the end of 2021.
Lastly, we've included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. For this year, we expect to receive the written decision regarding our WPL rate stabilization plan yet this quarter, including the final fuel cost recovery amounts for 2021. Next year, in Iowa, we plan to make an advanced rate-making principles filing for our planned 400 megawatts of new solar generation as well as a filing for the subsequent proceeding required as part of our test year 2020 retail, electric and gas rate review. Both of these filings are anticipated in the first half of next year. And in this content, we anticipate a decision from the PSCW regarding our first certificate of authority filing for solar generation by the second quarter. We also plan to make the second CA filing to round out our planned 1 gigawatt of Wisconsin solar in the first half of the year.
Lastly, in the second quarter of 2021, we plan to file a retail electric and gas rig review in Wisconsin. At this time, we are still evaluating whether there would be a single test year case or multiple test years. These regulatory initiatives are important components of our operational and financial results.
We very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you during the virtual EEI Finance Conference next week. Later today, we expect to post on our website the EEI investor presentation and the November 2020 Factbook, which detailed the IPL and WPL updated capital expenditures, rate base and construction work in progress forecast through 2024.
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

And as you know, the midpoint is where we spend a lot of time making sure we have a plan to get solidly within that range and we'll continue to.

And as we've shared with you and others, we do have some plans for increasing our T&D spend overhead to underground. As Robert and I both mentioned, you'd see a little bit of that in the tail end in 2024.
There's some great T&D spend yet. So as you know, we try to have that $1.2 to $1.4 billion per year is a really good spot for us to maintain the 5% to 7% minimal equity needs and keeping customer costs affordable. So we really like the CapEx plan and I would say there's some great T&D spend that we continue to look at and we'll just let capital compete as we always do, Julien. Thanks for the question."

The other half is largely related to our ability to manage costs and to accelerate some of the transformation activities for future sustainable savings.
And so we'll continue to work on those areas as we look into 2021 and look at all parts of the organization and implement really some changes to drive cost efficiencies throughout our business. I'm really excited about a lot of new technology opportunities for us to drive those expense reductions. And we're also operating with a lot of fewer employees by not backfilling certain vacated positions.

I hope you're all staying safe and healthy. Thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020.

Thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020. I'll share a few notable stories from the quarter and then turn the call over to Robert as he recaps some of our regulatory, customer and financial highlights.  
I'll start my comments with a focus on our recently issued Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship as well as our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve.
On the environmental front, we were excited to announce that we achieved our 2030 goal of having 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources, 10 years ahead of schedule. And we're not stopping there. Our customer-focused strategy continues to advance us toward a clean-energy future. And our responsibility report has been updated with new and even more aggressive clean-energy goals. These new goals are shown on Slide 2 of the supplemental slides.  
Our report also highlights the great work of our employees to support our customers and communities. This is not new for Alliant Energy. It's part of how we do business. We've continued to support our customers and communities as they respond to the ongoing demands of the COVID-19 health and economic crisis. Our charitable foundation recently released a new wave of community grants, benefiting more than 230 nonprofit organizations across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our stated purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities is core to everything we do, and we're proud of the many ways we help to build stronger communities where we live, work and raise our families.  
Now more than ever, the social part of our corporate responsibility is at the forefront. We are committed to partnering with our communities, working to understand and help address their needs. We act by providing financial support to agencies and nonprofit organizations that help our communities bridge gaps of social inequities and through programs that support food and security and housing, workforce readiness, environmental stewardship and diversity, safety and wellbeing. Our employees and retirees are a driving force in our communities, and I'm very proud to be part of the company that lives our values in so many ways.  
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert, who will address the trends we are seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer bases as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Our employees have made great progress in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts during the first half of the year while keeping a strong focus on safety and reliability.  
Turning to the execution of our strategy, I'll highlight progress we've made as we advance our Clean Energy Vision. A key driver to achieving our goals is the continued successful advancement of new renewable energy source, wind and solar. In May, we filed a Certificate of Authority with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. Collectively, these solar projects are expected to create more than 1,200 local construction jobs and, once operational, will provide an estimated $80 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years.  
In conjunction with our solar filing, we also announced our plans to retire our Edgewater Generating Station. Our efforts to transition our generation to a cleaner and more efficient fleet are not new. In fact, we've been on this path for over a decade. As we have in the past, we will live our values to care for others and do the right thing as we support the transition of impacted employees in the Sheboygan community.  
The expansion of our Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio as well as the decision to retire the Edgewater facility was a result of a year-long process that involved working with key stakeholders and ultimately forming what we call our Clean Energy Blueprint. We have a similar process started in Iowa and expect to share the results of our Clean Energy Blueprint for our IPL business later this year.  
Speaking of Iowa, I'll also share that we recently announced an innovative partnership with the city of Decorah. The new project features a 2.5-megawatt battery storage facility to support distributed solar. This battery system will help us better serve the community and allow us to efficiently integrate a growing desire for distributed energy resources.  
And while a lot of great work is happening related to solar and energy storage, I also want to highlight American Wind Week, which kicks off next Monday. We are proud to be part of advancing wind energy and the many benefits it brings to our customers and rural communities.  
We remain on track to install an additional 280 megawatts of wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. Our 130-megawatt Richland wind farm will be completed by the end of the third quarter. And our 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm is 80% complete and will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the United States.  
To summarize, we remain committed to focusing on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision, ensuring our investments are well executed, efficient and customer-focused, and delivering consistent returns for our investors with a 5% to 7% growth rate and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.  
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,678277295,2159986,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2020",2020-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base",1026,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base and higher electric margins from warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. We provided additional details on earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 3 and 4.  
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residential temperature-normalized sales increased 5% year-over-year, largely driven by our customers spending more time at home.  
On the other hand, commercial and industrial temperature-normalized sales declined 9%. Manufacturing sales, which make up approximately 50% of our commercial and industrial sales, were down 15% to 25% during April and May. And as expected, we saw material declines in electric sales in April and May to other sectors of our commercial and industrial customers, including retail, lodging and food service as a result of temporary business closures.  
More recently, we've been encouraged to see electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers rebound in June and July to levels that were only modestly lower than the same month last year. We are also fortunate to have a broad diversity of customers across our 2 state jurisdictions, but even saw certain customers, such as our food processing, packaging and warehouse customers, having flat to higher-than-normal sales at the initial months of the pandemic.  
With the faster-than-expected rebound in electric sales, we have updated our current projections to reflect an approximate 2% to 3% reduction in temperature-normalized electric sales for calendar year 2020 compared to last year. We have made significant progress mitigating this pandemic-related sales declines by accelerating planned cost transformation activities and reimagining how we do work. This is a direct reflection of our employees' leadership and dedication to reducing cost for our customers.  
I speak for the entire executive team in sharing my appreciation for the employees of Alliant Energy, especially for the men and women who are in the field each day, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of affordable energy to our customers throughout this pandemic. The health crisis has reaffirmed how essential energy services are to the country and a reminder of just how critical our purpose is to the communities and customers we serve.  
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 10% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits which flowed back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins, thereby resulting in no material impact on full year earnings.
The timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. This results in higher earnings in the first half of the year and lower earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the results of last year.  
On Slide 7, we have provided the details of our financial plan for 2020, which has now largely been completed. In June, we finalized a $400 million, 10-year bond issuance at our Iowa utility and used part of the proceeds to call early a maturity that was due later this year. This deal was well received by the market and achieved the lowest bond interest rate in our Iowa utility's history. We will also use a portion of the remaining proceeds from the new bond issuance to make $110 million payment in September for the buyout of the Duane Arnold purchase power agreement.  
Our current liquidity is approximately $1.1 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. With no material debt maturities in 2021, we are well positioned to respond to any potential changes in projected cash flows.  
The key to achieving our updated carbon dioxide emission goals is expanding our use of clean energy resources. As John mentioned, we recently announced plans to retire one of our Wisconsin coal-fired generator facilities and to add 1,000 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin by the end of 2023. We recently filed a Certificate of Authority request for the first phase of construction, which includes 675 megawatts of new solar generation. As a result of this filing, we are planning to ship $350 million of capital expenditures into 2021 and 2022 that were originally forecasted in 2023.
The earlier timing of capital expenditures is based on our progress with development activities to date and the expected construction schedules. Our forecast also assumes 35% of the construction costs will be financed through tax equity partners. The contributions from the tax equity partners are current when the projects are placed in service. We expect to place 425 megawatts of solar into service in 2022 and 575 megawatts of the service in 2023. 
We plan to refresh our full future capital expenditure forecast and disclose our 2021 financing plans as part of our third quarter earnings release in November. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. As shown on the slide, our regulatory calendar for 2020 has many key milestones now behind us. The one noteworthy disclosure development since our last quarterly earnings call was the Wisconsin Certificate of Authority filing in late May for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. The filing is progressing as expected, and we are currently awaiting the procedural schedule. 
We are also encouraged by the progress on our 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal in Wisconsin. Comments recently filed by the innovating groups representing our retail customers include support for the proposal. We anticipate a decision from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on our proposal later this quarter. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with all of you virtually over the coming months. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

So we're expecting that decision or that issue will be addressed in the next rate filing that we make sometime next year.

Thank you for joining us today as we highlight our solid results for the second quarter of 2020. I'll share a few notable stories from the quarter and then turn the call over to Robert as he recaps some of our regulatory, customer and financial highlights.  
I'll start my comments with a focus on our recently issued Corporate Responsibility Report. This year's update showcases many examples of our environmental stewardship as well as our long-standing efforts to address the important social needs of the communities we proudly serve.
On the environmental front, we were excited to announce that we achieved our 2030 goal of having 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources, 10 years ahead of schedule. And we're not stopping there. Our customer-focused strategy continues to advance us toward a clean-energy future. And our responsibility report has been updated with new and even more aggressive clean-energy goals. These new goals are shown on Slide 2 of the supplemental slides.  
Our report also highlights the great work of our employees to support our customers and communities. This is not new for Alliant Energy. It's part of how we do business. We've continued to support our customers and communities as they respond to the ongoing demands of the COVID-19 health and economic crisis. Our charitable foundation recently released a new wave of community grants, benefiting more than 230 nonprofit organizations across Iowa and Wisconsin. Our stated purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities is core to everything we do, and we're proud of the many ways we help to build stronger communities where we live, work and raise our families.  
Now more than ever, the social part of our corporate responsibility is at the forefront. We are committed to partnering with our communities, working to understand and help address their needs. We act by providing financial support to agencies and nonprofit organizations that help our communities bridge gaps of social inequities and through programs that support food and security and housing, workforce readiness, environmental stewardship and diversity, safety and wellbeing. Our employees and retirees are a driving force in our communities, and I'm very proud to be part of the company that lives our values in so many ways.  
In a few moments, I'll turn the call over to Robert, who will address the trends we are seeing across our residential, commercial and industrial customer bases as a result of the ongoing COVID pandemic. Our employees have made great progress in driving cost reductions and advancing our broader transformation efforts during the first half of the year while keeping a strong focus on safety and reliability.  
Turning to the execution of our strategy, I'll highlight progress we've made as we advance our Clean Energy Vision. A key driver to achieving our goals is the continued successful advancement of new renewable energy source, wind and solar. In May, we filed a Certificate of Authority with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. Collectively, these solar projects are expected to create more than 1,200 local construction jobs and, once operational, will provide an estimated $80 million in local tax revenues over the next 30 years.  
In conjunction with our solar filing, we also announced our plans to retire our Edgewater Generating Station. Our efforts to transition our generation to a cleaner and more efficient fleet are not new. In fact, we've been on this path for over a decade. As we have in the past, we will live our values to care for others and do the right thing as we support the transition of impacted employees in the Sheboygan community.  
The expansion of our Wisconsin renewable resource portfolio as well as the decision to retire the Edgewater facility was a result of a year-long process that involved working with key stakeholders and ultimately forming what we call our Clean Energy Blueprint. We have a similar process started in Iowa and expect to share the results of our Clean Energy Blueprint for our IPL business later this year.  
Speaking of Iowa, I'll also share that we recently announced an innovative partnership with the city of Decorah. The new project features a 2.5-megawatt battery storage facility to support distributed solar. This battery system will help us better serve the community and allow us to efficiently integrate a growing desire for distributed energy resources.  
And while a lot of great work is happening related to solar and energy storage, I also want to highlight American Wind Week, which kicks off next Monday. We are proud to be part of advancing wind energy and the many benefits it brings to our customers and rural communities.  
We remain on track to install an additional 280 megawatts of wind for our Iowa and Wisconsin customers by the end of this year. Our 130-megawatt Richland wind farm will be completed by the end of the third quarter. And our 150-megawatt Kossuth wind farm is 80% complete and will be placed into service in the fourth quarter of this year, making us the third largest owner-operator of regulated wind in the United States.  
To summarize, we remain committed to focusing on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and communities, advancing our Clean Energy Vision, ensuring our investments are well executed, efficient and customer-focused, and delivering consistent returns for our investors with a 5% to 7% growth rate and our 60% to 70% dividend payout ratio.  
Thank you for your interest in Alliant Energy. I'll now turn the call over to Robert."
312949,678277295,2159987,"Alliant Energy Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Aug 07, 2020",2020-08-07,"Earnings Calls","Alliant Energy Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base",1026,"Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $0.54 per share compared to $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2019. Our utilities had higher earnings year-over-year, driven by increasing rate base and higher electric margins from warmer temperatures. These increases in earnings were partially offset by higher depreciation expense. We provided additional details on earnings variance drivers for the quarter on Slides 3 and 4.  
Our temperature-normalized retail electric sales in the second quarter were down 6% versus last year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residential temperature-normalized sales increased 5% year-over-year, largely driven by our customers spending more time at home.  
On the other hand, commercial and industrial temperature-normalized sales declined 9%. Manufacturing sales, which make up approximately 50% of our commercial and industrial sales, were down 15% to 25% during April and May. And as expected, we saw material declines in electric sales in April and May to other sectors of our commercial and industrial customers, including retail, lodging and food service as a result of temporary business closures.  
More recently, we've been encouraged to see electric sales to our commercial and industrial customers rebound in June and July to levels that were only modestly lower than the same month last year. We are also fortunate to have a broad diversity of customers across our 2 state jurisdictions, but even saw certain customers, such as our food processing, packaging and warehouse customers, having flat to higher-than-normal sales at the initial months of the pandemic.  
With the faster-than-expected rebound in electric sales, we have updated our current projections to reflect an approximate 2% to 3% reduction in temperature-normalized electric sales for calendar year 2020 compared to last year. We have made significant progress mitigating this pandemic-related sales declines by accelerating planned cost transformation activities and reimagining how we do work. This is a direct reflection of our employees' leadership and dedication to reducing cost for our customers.  
I speak for the entire executive team in sharing my appreciation for the employees of Alliant Energy, especially for the men and women who are in the field each day, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of affordable energy to our customers throughout this pandemic. The health crisis has reaffirmed how essential energy services are to the country and a reminder of just how critical our purpose is to the communities and customers we serve.  
Slide 6 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our 2 utilities and our consolidated group. We currently estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 10% for 2020. The primary drivers of the lower tax rate are production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits which flowed back to customers, resulting in lower electric margins, thereby resulting in no material impact on full year earnings.
The timing of wind production tax credits and excess deferred income tax amortizations are recognized will cause quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in earnings. This results in higher earnings in the first half of the year and lower earnings in the second half of the year when compared to the results of last year.  
On Slide 7, we have provided the details of our financial plan for 2020, which has now largely been completed. In June, we finalized a $400 million, 10-year bond issuance at our Iowa utility and used part of the proceeds to call early a maturity that was due later this year. This deal was well received by the market and achieved the lowest bond interest rate in our Iowa utility's history. We will also use a portion of the remaining proceeds from the new bond issuance to make $110 million payment in September for the buyout of the Duane Arnold purchase power agreement.  
Our current liquidity is approximately $1.1 billion, including cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility and our sale of accounts receivable program. With no material debt maturities in 2021, we are well positioned to respond to any potential changes in projected cash flows.  
The key to achieving our updated carbon dioxide emission goals is expanding our use of clean energy resources. As John mentioned, we recently announced plans to retire one of our Wisconsin coal-fired generator facilities and to add 1,000 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin by the end of 2023. We recently filed a Certificate of Authority request for the first phase of construction, which includes 675 megawatts of new solar generation. As a result of this filing, we are planning to ship $350 million of capital expenditures into 2021 and 2022 that were originally forecasted in 2023.
The earlier timing of capital expenditures is based on our progress with development activities to date and the expected construction schedules. Our forecast also assumes 35% of the construction costs will be financed through tax equity partners. The contributions from the tax equity partners are current when the projects are placed in service. We expect to place 425 megawatts of solar into service in 2022 and 575 megawatts of the service in 2023. 
We plan to refresh our full future capital expenditure forecast and disclose our 2021 financing plans as part of our third quarter earnings release in November. 
Lastly, we have included our regulatory initiatives of note on Slide 8. As shown on the slide, our regulatory calendar for 2020 has many key milestones now behind us. The one noteworthy disclosure development since our last quarterly earnings call was the Wisconsin Certificate of Authority filing in late May for 675 megawatts of new solar generation. The filing is progressing as expected, and we are currently awaiting the procedural schedule. 
We are also encouraged by the progress on our 2021 customer rate stabilization proposal in Wisconsin. Comments recently filed by the innovating groups representing our retail customers include support for the proposal. We anticipate a decision from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin on our proposal later this quarter. 
We appreciate your continued interest in our company and look forward to connecting with all of you virtually over the coming months. 
At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session."

You walked through the use of proceeds and all that. But I guess I'm asking, it was upsized, right? The first quarter slide deck showed up to $300 million, and you actually raised $400 million. Can you just discuss why that was upsized and what that means for the balance sheet and future plans for debt issuances?"

Yes, as we got into the deal, very strong market demand for that debt issuance, and we utilize that, obviously, to capture that lower interest rate. To this point, we've used the proceeds largely for 2 purposes. One is to retire $200 million of debt in June that was expected to be maturing in, I think, September of this year. Right now, we have about $200 million left on our balance sheet in the form of cash. We're going to use $110 million of that for the payment that we need to make to NextEra to terminate the Duane Arnold Energy purchase power agreement. And the remaining funds will largely be invested in the wind projects that we're continuing to finish up, including the Richland project that will be finished up sometime later this quarter."

We did see a step-change improvement in Q2, a little faster recovery towards the tail end of that than what we had originally planned. And then as Robert mentioned, we're keeping flexibility in our plan for a little bit of the unknown. So part of our planning was to look at a few different scenarios for the back half.
