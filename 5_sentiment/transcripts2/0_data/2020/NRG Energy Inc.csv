I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of our Operations. 
This earnings call marks the 4-year anniversary since we started a new direction for NRG. We have accomplished many things together. We refocused and streamlined our business to better serve our customers. We significantly reduced our total debt and strengthened our balance sheet, which is now on a path to an investment-grade rating. We provided discipline and transparency on how we invest our capital. And most importantly, we have done it the right way for our employees and our stakeholders.  The company has never been stronger or with a brighter future than it is today. 
I'd like to start by highlighting the key messages for the quarter on Slide 3. First, our integrated business delivered EBITDA in line with our 2019 expectations during a period of volatile market conditions, further validating the benefits of integration between retail and wholesale. As such, we're also reaffirming 2020 guidance. 
Second, we have a comprehensive sustainability framework with industry-leading carbon reduction goals. Given that I view this framework as foundational to our business and an integral part of our long-term strategy, I will provide additional detail later in the presentation. 
And third, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy by adhering to our principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. 
Moving to the business and financial highlights on Slide 4. Beginning with our 2019 scorecard on the left-hand side of the slide, we executed well on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results despite challenging market conditions during the summer. We also had our best safety year ever, marking this the second back-to-back years of record performance. Congratulations to all my colleagues for this remarkable accomplishment. 
With respect to our Transformation Plan, we deliver on our goals. We have now completed over 90% of the plan with all cost savings and working capital completed and $80 million of additional margin enhancement remaining to be achieved in 2020. 
After 2 years of focusing on rightsizing the business and strengthening our balance sheet, in 2019, we focus on perfecting our integrated business. We signed 1.6 gigawatts of medium-term solar PPAs in ERCOT; returned our Gregory plant to service ahead of the summer; and acquired Stream Energy, adding important capabilities to our retail portfolio. 
We also announced the acceleration of our science-based carbon reduction goals to align with guidance from the new intergovernmental panel on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, so as to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
Finally, we continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles and provided additional transparency into our long-term capital allocation plan. In 2019, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also announced the increase of the dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, with the first payment made in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's with a positive outlook, moving us closer to our goal of a solid investment-grade rating. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, similar to how we have presented the financials throughout the year, EBITDA is shown on a same-store basis, adjusted for asset sales and deconsolidations. We ended the year with $1.977 billion of EBITDA or 24% higher than last year. While we deliver on EBITDA, our free cash flow came in below our expected range due to timing issues with Kirk -- which Kirk will address in greater detail later in the presentation. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to talk to you about our comprehensive sustainability framework. It is one that expands across our business from operations and employees to customers and suppliers. Sustainability is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. 
Beginning on Slide 5, our sustainability philosophy is guided by 3 core principles: accountability, transparency and engagement. 
So let me start with accountability. Good intentions are just not enough. We need goals that are clear and measurable. We have a few examples in this slide, including safety, environmental responsibility and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
You have heard me say this before. Safety is our #1 priority. We measure and report our safety performance every quarter, and we hold ourselves accountable to top decile performance. In this way, we're able to take corrective actions to improve our performance in periods where we fall below our standards. Like safety, we have many other goals across our business, that measure not just what we do but how we do it, including our carbon reduction goals, which I will address in more detail in the next slide. 
Measurable goals are important, but we also need to communicate our progress in a clear and transparent way. We do this every year with the release of our Sustainability Report. We were the first and only company in our sector to comply with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, back in 2016. We were one of the first companies to publicly commit to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD. And recently, we were awarded leadership level across all 3 carbon disclosure project, or CDP programs, on climate risk, water security and supply chain and engagement. 
Finally, we are committed to engaging and investing in the communities where we live and do business, from major cities with large concentrations of customers to smaller communities that are home to our power plants and employees. In 2019 alone, we donated to almost 700 organizations. But we aren't just focused on monetary donations. We're also investing our time in the communities with over 11,000 volunteer hours by our employees across 264 organizations. We also participate with organizations like CECP, where we presented our sustainability framework and long-term strategy to investors. This engagement is something that makes us very proud and defines us as a company. 
Now let me turn to Slide 6. I want to talk to you about our decarbonization efforts as we transition our business away from traditional generation and closer to the retail customer. In September of last year, we accelerated our current reduction goals to conform with a 1.5 degree trajectory. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and to be net 0 by 2050. These goals are some of the most ambitious in the sector, and we're proud with the progress that we have made to date. We are already 83% of the way to our 2025 goal with clear line of sight to achieve it with our current portfolio. 
Although our baseline is 2014, we have been decarbonizing our fleet since 2010, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in just the last 10 years. That is the equivalent of taking 9 million cars off the road every year. As you can see, our actions move the needle. We will continue to share our progress and plans in the months to come. 
From an earnings perspective, as we progress towards decarbonization, cogeneration is contributing less and less to our earnings. Moving to the right side of the slide. In just the last 6 years, coal as a percentage of our total revenues has decreased 55%, and that is inclusive of capacity revenues. This is an important distinction as energy revenues have been the bulk of the decline and our coal assets in the East now act primarily as insurance for grid reliability and not for electric generation. 
Finally, sustainability is an integral part of our culture and incorporated in our strategic decisions. We continue to take concrete actions to limit our own carbon footprint while also providing customers with cleaner energy choices, such as electricity plants from renewable resources. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future and be on the lookout for the release of our Annual Sustainability Report in early May. 
Now turning to Slide 7, I want to provide you a brief update on our core markets. Beginning on the left side of the slide, as you can see on the chart, electric demand in ERCOT continues to grow at the fastest pace in the nation, between 2% and 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Now as you all know, the direct result of this robust load growth is a record tight supply-demand balance or reserve margin. This requires a tremendous amount of generation investments simply to maintain the current low reserve margin. 
As a large participant in the market, we are looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium-term PPAs. These PPAs enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. 
From an overall market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable build cycle. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we are seeing steady progress in all of our core markets with FERC, ISOs and states, addressing the current market design and adapting it to the evolved grid of the future. While progress has not been perfect, we support efforts that create durable markets that benefit consumers and foster the transition to a cleaner and sustainable energy future. 
In ERCOT, regulators continue to refine their scarcity pricing mechanism to incentivize new generation, which is predominantly renewable and intermittent, while adequately compensating existing resources that provide firm or dispatchable generation. 
In the East, FERC issued a ruling on the PJM capacity market proceeding which resulted from its finding that current market is unjust and unreasonable. This ruling seeks to correctly account for resources that receive state subsidies, particularly out of markets nuclear subsidies that stifle development of renewable energy and distorts the integrity of competitive markets. This ruling is just the most recent in a series of market reforms that PJM and FERC have undertaken since 2004 to protect the integrity of competitive markets. 
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 8. You can see that our track record is directly in line with our road map to value creation of stabilize, rightsize and now redefine our company. 
During 2019, we achieved our investment-grade credit metric target. We announced the highly accretive stream retail transaction and closed it within 3 months. And in line with my commitment to returning capital, we increased our dividend tenfold and executed $1.44 billion in share repurchases. 
For our 2020 capital allocation plan, we are already executing. We paid our first dividend under our recently announced $1.20 per share, with 7% to 9% annual growth dividend policy. We have already begun executing share repurchases under our current $400 million share buyback program, consistent with the 50% return of capital commitment. And like in 2019, and every year since I took over as CEO, you can expect disciplined and timely allocation of our excess on committed capital as we earn it throughout the year. 
Last, I want to remind everyone about our capital allocation framework on the right side of the slide. As you can see on the waterfall, we remain committed to maintaining top decile safety and operational excellence. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet, having now achieved investment-grade credit metrics. And last quarter, we provided enhanced visibility into our long-term capital return philosophy. At least 50% will be returned through a mix of dividends and share repurchases. For the other 50%, we remain committed to our growth investment criteria which must meet or exceed our financial thresholds and be consistent with our core strategy or it will be returned to shareholders. 
Now given that the seasonality of our cash flows and liquidity ultimately inform capital allocation, it is my intention for the 50% return of capital to be allocated more programmatically with a dividend paid quarterly and share repurchases throughout the year. 
In the risk of being redundant, as we have consistently said on nearly every earnings call and every meeting, we are committed to being prudent allocators of shareholder capital. We will continue to demonstrate our discipline by adhering to our stated principles and allocate capital to opportunities that maximizes long-term value for your investment. That's our mindset. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus",1157,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus 2018, largely due to higher supply costs in the ERCOT region. 
Highlighting the benefits of our integrated platform, higher wholesale prices, particularly in ERCOT, benefited our Generation segment, which delivered $1.057 billion in 2019. Moreover, as our prior year 2018 generation results included approximately $180 million in EBITDA from assets subsequently sold, as well as Agua Caliente and Ivanpah results prior to their deconsolidation. 
On a same-store basis, our 2019 generation EBITDA results represented over a $400 million year-over-year increase in EBITDA. Our consolidated 2019 results also include the benefit of the full run rate of $590 million in cost savings as well as $135 million of margin enhancement from our Transformation Plan. 2019 free cash flow before growth was $1.212 billion. Although these results represent a $92 million increase over 2018, free cash flow fell short of our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion due to the impact of a delay in the timing of certain cash flow items, which will now contribute to 2020 free cash flow. 
In total, on a net basis, the impact of these timing-related items was approximately $60 million. The largest component of these items was the delay in the receipt of $34 million in AMT credit refunds due to NRG in 2019 as a result of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act. NRG filed the required documentation associated with these refunds on time, and we fully expect to receive them in 2020. The balance of the net timing impact primarily consists of other working capital-related items, which we now expect in 2020. And as a result, the full amount of the $60 million will be realized in this year. 
Turning to an update on share repurchase activity. We completed the latest $250 million share repurchase program announced in 2019 and have now turned toward executing on programmatic share repurchases in 2020 as a part of our revised capital allocation framework announced last quarter. This framework includes our commitment to returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of our increased dividend and ongoing share repurchases. As a result, in 2020, we expect to execute on approximately $380 million of incremental share repurchases, which I'll explain in greater detail in a few moments. 
In 2019, we reduced debt by $600 million and achieved our target investment-grade metrics for the year. We also realized an important milestone as we continue toward our goal to align our ratings with our credit metrics and our reduced risk profile, as we received an upgrade from Moody's to Ba1, 1 notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook. 
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted -- consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, and consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a final summary of 2019 capital allocation, with changes since our prior update highlighted in blue. After adjusting for 2019 actual cash flow results, our total 2019 excess capital available was $2.845 billion, and was allocated as follows: just over $700 million, or approximately 25%, was used to fund reductions in total debt in order to achieve our target investment-grade metrics; $1.44 billion, representing just over 50% of total capital, was used to fund share repurchases during 2019. 
We  ended the year with $60 million remaining under the most recent $250 million buyback program and have completed these repurchases during early 2020. Dividends in 2019, under the prior dividend policy, represented the balance of return of shareholder capital, and, of course, will represent a significantly more robust component of capital allocation going forward. $551 million was allocated to growth and other investments or approximately a $30 million increase versus our prior update, reflecting M&A fees and other integration costs associated with our retail acquisition. 
After a slight shift in Transformation Plan cost to achieve from 2019 to 2020, we ended 2019 with $35 million in unallocated capital, which will be part of the 2020 summary. And I'll now turn to that on Slide 12. 
As shown on the left of Slide 12, the combination of $35 million carried over from 2019, plus the midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance leads to just over $1.4 billion in capital available for allocation in 2020. As I mentioned before, we ended 2019 with a $60 million balance remaining under our latest buyback program, which has now been completed in 2020. Adjusting for that 2019 carryover, we have $1.35 billion in 2020 capital remaining to be allocated, to which we then apply our framework of 50% return of shareholder capital and 50% toward potential value-accretive investment opportunities. $675 million will be returned to shareholders in 2020 via our increased dividend for $295 million, and the balance of $380 million through ongoing share repurchases, of which we have executed $62 million year-to-date. 
The remaining 50% of excess capital is available for potential investment opportunities, of which only $61 million are currently identified. As shown in the box below the chart, this consists of the balance of cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan; our ongoing commitment to legacy GenOn pension obligations; and costs associated with readying the site of our retired Encina generating station in California to be marketed for redevelopment. This site is located in San Diego County and is a prime location for real estate development. As with our successful sale of the Potrero site outside San Francisco just a few years ago, the Encina represents a similar compelling opportunity for monetization. 
The balance of $614 million in unallocated capital remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value-enhancing opportunities, which exceed both our hurdle rate as well as the opportunity cost of our own stock, we intend to allocate any remaining balance of this capital to our shareholders. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13. Based on 2019 actual results, we ended the year near the midpoint of our target investment-grade metric range. For 2020, we remain on track to further strengthen our investment-grade credit metrics to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of achieving investment-grade credit metrics for NRG. Importantly, we expect to achieve these results without the need for additional capital allocation toward debt reduction. And we continue to believe that the combination of our stable cash flows and strong credit metrics, along with the continued execution, places us in a position to build on our recent ratings upgrade toward achieving investment-grade ratings over the next 12 to 18 months. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2020 priorities and expectations. As always, our top priority remains delivering on our financial and operational objectives and adhering to our capital allocation principles. In addition to completing our Transformation Plan, we remain focused on further perfecting and growing our business. This means rebalancing our current portfolio through additional asset optimization efforts and growing our customer base with compelling retail products, supported by capital-light generation supply. 
With a large asset sales completed, we're looking at further optimizing single assets and our real estate portfolio at large. An example of that is what we're doing at the Encina site, getting it ready for commercial redevelopment and the development and sale of Canal 3. These type of projects are generally highly accretive, don't use permanent capital and further simplify our story. We will also continue to enhance and simplify our disclosures to better align with the way we manage our integrated business. In the next earnings call, we will provide additional disclosures around our ERCOT platform. 
Finally, and like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it simpler and more predictable, while consistently returning significant capital to shareholders. I am very excited for 2020 and the future of our company, and I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG.

So we're constantly and continuously going to evaluate our generation portfolio in light of that priority. California is less strategic, less core because we don't have a retail business.

Given the uncertainty with what's happening with the FERC ruling around capacity auctions and the capacity market, do you see any concern that if every state were to step away from the PJM capacity market that it has a risk for you in terms of your capacity revenue? Or kind of how do you see that playing out?"

While we have been very active on the PJM discussion, I also are mindful that is the exposure that we have is just less than 5% of our EBITDA, so we need to allocate resources accordingly to that. Having said that, I will tell you that I was very pleased with the FERC order. I think it is very consistent with what they have done in previous years, which is maintain the integrity of competitive markets, which have greatly benefited consumers across the PJM footprint. So with that said, Chris, in terms of what to expect next?"

I would say that I agree with Mauricio there that the FERC MOPR ruling was positive for competitive markets and should help mitigate some of the impact of handouts to some local utilities. You're talking about states pulling out. Arguably, that's the FRR process. And I think as states look at that, they may see that the FRR is an inferior alternative for consumers to a region-wide capacity market. I mean, if you look at the history of FRRs, they have consistently cost the consumers in that area 3 to 10x the prevailing auction rate. They shift risk onto a captive set of ratepayers, lock in the local monopoly. The latest numbers I saw from the IMM indicates that the nukes that are getting this X right now are profitable without them, so it's unclear to me why an FRR would be the choice of anybody except the ones receiving those subsidies. So yes, there's obviously a lot of smoke around this right now, and a lot of states are talking about it. But I mean, if you dig into what FRRs have done in the past and what they're expected to do in the future, it doesn't seem like a great idea for me."

I don't see the same attractive opportunities in the generation side, that's why we have been executing on our capital-light PPA strategy. So I mean, I don't disagree with you.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of our Operations. 
This earnings call marks the 4-year anniversary since we started a new direction for NRG. We have accomplished many things together. We refocused and streamlined our business to better serve our customers. We significantly reduced our total debt and strengthened our balance sheet, which is now on a path to an investment-grade rating. We provided discipline and transparency on how we invest our capital. And most importantly, we have done it the right way for our employees and our stakeholders.  The company has never been stronger or with a brighter future than it is today. 
I'd like to start by highlighting the key messages for the quarter on Slide 3. First, our integrated business delivered EBITDA in line with our 2019 expectations during a period of volatile market conditions, further validating the benefits of integration between retail and wholesale. As such, we're also reaffirming 2020 guidance. 
Second, we have a comprehensive sustainability framework with industry-leading carbon reduction goals. Given that I view this framework as foundational to our business and an integral part of our long-term strategy, I will provide additional detail later in the presentation. 
And third, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy by adhering to our principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. 
Moving to the business and financial highlights on Slide 4. Beginning with our 2019 scorecard on the left-hand side of the slide, we executed well on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results despite challenging market conditions during the summer. We also had our best safety year ever, marking this the second back-to-back years of record performance. Congratulations to all my colleagues for this remarkable accomplishment. 
With respect to our Transformation Plan, we deliver on our goals. We have now completed over 90% of the plan with all cost savings and working capital completed and $80 million of additional margin enhancing -- enhancement remaining to be achieved in 2020. 
After 2 years of focusing on rightsizing the business and strengthening our balance sheet, in 2019, we focus on perfecting our integrated business. We signed 1.6 gigawatts of medium-term solar PPAs in ERCOT; returned our Gregory plant to service ahead of the summer; and acquired Stream Energy, adding important capabilities to our retail portfolio. 
We also announced the acceleration of our science-based carbon reduction goals to align with guidance from the new intergovernmental panel on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, so as to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
Finally, we continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles and provided additional transparency into our long-term capital allocation plan. In 2019, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also announced the increase of the dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, with the first payment made in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's with a positive outlook, moving us closer to our goal of a solid investment-grade rating. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, similar to how we have presented the financials throughout the year, EBITDA is shown on a same-store basis, adjusted for asset sales and deconsolidations. We ended the year with $1.977 billion of EBITDA or 24% higher than last year. While we deliver on EBITDA, our free cash flow came in below our expected range due to timing issues with Kirk -- which Kirk will address in greater detail later in the presentation. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to talk to you about our comprehensive sustainability framework. It is one that expands across our business from operations and employees to customers and suppliers. Sustainability is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. 
Beginning on Slide 5, our sustainability philosophy is guided by 3 core principles: accountability, transparency and engagement. 
So let me start with accountability. Good intentions are just not enough. We need goals that are clear and measurable. We have a few examples in this slide, including safety, environmental responsibility and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
You have heard me say this before. Safety is our #1 priority. We measure and report our safety performance every quarter, and we hold ourselves accountable to top decile performance. In this way, we're able to take corrective actions to improve our performance in periods where we fall below our standards. Like safety, we have many other goals across our business that measure, not just what we do, but how we do it, including our carbon reduction goals, which I will address in more detail in the next slide. 
Measurable goals are important, but we also need to communicate our progress in a clear and transparent way. We do this every year with the release of our Sustainability Report. We were the first and only company in our sector to comply with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, back in 2016. We were one of the first companies to publicly commit to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD. And recently, we were awarded leadership level across all 3 carbon disclosure project, or CDP programs, on climate risk, water security and supply chain engagement. 
Finally, we are committed to engaging and investing in the communities where we live and do business, from major cities where -- with large concentrations of customers to smaller communities that are home to our power plants and employees. In 2019 alone, we donated to almost 700 organizations. But we aren't just focused on monetary donations. We're also investing our time in the communities with over 11,000 volunteer hours by our employees across 264 organizations. 
We also participate with organizations like CECP, where we presented our sustainability framework and long-term strategy to investors. This engagement is something that makes us very proud and defines us as a company. 
Now let me turn to Slide 6. I want to talk to you about our decarbonization efforts as we transition our business away from traditional generation and closer to the retail customer. In September of last year, we accelerated our carbon reduction goals to conform with a 1.5-degree trajectory. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and to be net 0 by 2050. These goals are some of the most ambitious in the sector, and we're proud with the progress that we have made to date. We are already 83% of the way to our 2025 goal with clear line of sight to achieve it with our current portfolio. 
Although our baseline is 2014, we have been decarbonizing our fleet since 2010, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in just the last 10 years. That is the equivalent of taking 9 million cars off the road every year. As you can see, our actions move the needle. We will continue to share our progress and plans in the months to come. 
From an earnings perspective, as we progress toward decarbonization, cogeneration is contributing less and less to our earnings. Moving to the right side of the slide. In just the last 6 years, coal as a percentage of our total revenues has decreased 55%, and that is inclusive of capacity revenues. This is an important distinction as energy revenues have been the bulk of the decline and our coal assets in the East now act primarily as insurance for grid reliability and not for electric generation. 
Finally, sustainability is an integral part of our culture and incorporated in our -- incorporated it in our strategic decisions. We continue to take concrete actions to limit our own carbon footprint while also providing customers with cleaner energy choices, such as electricity plants from renewable resources. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future and be on the lookout for the release of our annual Sustainability Report in early May. 
Now turning to Slide 7, I want to provide you a brief update on our core markets. Beginning on the left side of the slide, as you can see on the chart, electric demand in ERCOT continues to grow at the fastest pace in the nation, between 2% and 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Now as you all know, the direct result of this robust load growth is a record tight supply-demand balance or reserve margin. This requires a tremendous amount of generation investments simply to maintain the current low reserve margin. 
As a large participant in the market, we are looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium-term PPAs. These PPAs enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. 
From an overall market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable build cycle. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we are seeing steady progress in all of our core markets with FERC, ISOs and states, addressing the current market design and adapting it to the evolved grid of the future. While progress has not been perfect, we support efforts that create durable markets that benefit consumers and foster the transition to a cleaner and sustainable energy future. 
In ERCOT, regulators continue to refine their scarcity pricing mechanism to incentivize new generation, which is predominantly renewable and intermittent, while adequately compensating existing resources that provide firm or dispatchable generation. 
In the East, FERC issued a ruling on the PJM capacity market proceeding, which resulted from its finding that current market is unjust and unreasonable. This ruling seeks to correctly account for resources that receive state subsidies, particularly out-of-markets nuclear subsidies that stifle development of renewable energy and distorts the integrity of competitive markets. This ruling is just the most recent in a series of market reforms that PJM and FERC have undertaken since 2004 to protect the integrity of competitive markets. 
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 8. You can see that our track record is directly in line with our road map to value creation of stabilize, rightsize and now, redefine our company. 
During 2019, we achieved our investment-grade credit metric target. We announced the highly accretive stream retail transaction and closed it within 3 months. And in line with my commitment to returning capital, we increased our dividend tenfold and executed $1.44 billion in share repurchases. 
For our 2020 capital allocation plan, we are already executing. We paid our first dividend under our recently announced $1.20 per share, with 7% to 9% annual growth dividend policy. We have already begun executing share repurchases under our current $400 million share buyback program, consistent with the 50% return of capital commitment. And like in 2019, and every year since I took over as CEO, you can expect disciplined and timely allocation of our excess on committed capital as we earn it throughout the year. 
Last, I want to remind everyone about our capital allocation framework on the right side of the slide. As you can see on the waterfall, we remain committed to maintaining top decile safety and operational excellence. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet, having now achieved investment-grade credit metrics. And last quarter, we provided enhanced visibility into our long-term capital return philosophy. At least 50% will be returned through a mix of dividends and share repurchases. For the other 50%, we remain committed to our growth investment criteria which must meet or exceed our financial thresholds and be consistent with our core strategy or it will be returned to shareholders. 
Now given that the seasonality of our cash flows and liquidity ultimately inform capital allocation, it is my intention for the 50% return of capital to be allocated more programmatically with a dividend paid quarterly and share repurchases throughout the year. 
In the risk of being redundant, as we have consistently said on nearly every earnings call and every meeting, we are committed to being prudent allocators of shareholder capital. We will continue to demonstrate our discipline by adhering to our stated principles and allocate capital to opportunities that maximizes long-term value for your investment. That's our mindset. 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Our consolidated 2019 results also include the benefit of the full run rate of $590 million in cost savings as well as $135 million of margin enhancement from our Transformation Plan. 2019 free cash flow before growth was $1.212 billion. Although these results represent a $92 million increase over 2018, free cash flow fell short of our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion due to the impact of a delay in the timing of certain cash flow items, which will now contribute to 2020 free cash flow. 
In total, on a net basis, the impact of these timing-related items was approximately $60 million. The largest component of these items was the delay in the receipt of $34 million in AMT credit refunds due to NRG in 2019 as a result of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act. NRG filed the required documentation associated with these refunds on time, and we fully expect to receive them in 2020. The balance of the net timing impact primarily consist of other working capital-related items which we now expect in 2020. And as a result, the full amount of the $60 million will be realized in this year. 
Turning to an update on share repurchase activity. We completed the latest $250 million share repurchase program announced in 2019 and have now turned toward executing on programmatic share repurchases in 2020 as a part of our revised capital allocation framework announced last quarter. This framework includes our commitment to returning at least 50% of the annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of our increased dividend and ongoing share repurchases. As a result, in 2020, we expect to execute on approximately $380 million of incremental share repurchases, which I'll explain in greater detail in a few moments. 
In 2019, we reduced debt by $600 million and achieved our target investment-grade metrics for the year. We also realized an important milestone as we continue toward our goal to align our ratings with our credit metrics and our reduced risk profile, as we received an upgrade from Moody's to Ba1, 1 notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook. 
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted -- consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, and consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a final summary of 2019 capital allocation, with changes since our prior update highlighted in blue. After adjusting for 2019 actual cash flow results, our total 2019 excess capital available was $2.845 billion, and was allocated as follows: just over $700 million, or approximately 25%, was used to fund reductions in total debt in order to achieve our target investment-grade metrics; $1.44 billion, representing just over 50% of total capital, was used to fund share repurchases during 2019. 
We ended the year with $60 million remaining under the most recent $250 million buyback program and have completed these repurchases during early 2020. Dividends in 2019, under the prior dividend policy, represented the balance of return of shareholder capital, and, of course, will represent a significantly more robust component of capital allocation going forward. $551 million was allocated to growth in other investments or approximately a $30 million increase versus our prior update, reflecting M&A fees and other integration costs associated with our retail acquisition. 
After a slight shift in Transformation Plan cost to achieve from 2019 to 2020, we ended 2019 with $35 million in unallocated capital, which will be part of the 2020 summary. And I'll now turn to that on Slide 12. 
As shown on the left of Slide 12, the combination of $35 million carried over from 2019, plus the midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance, leads to just over $1.4 billion in capital available for allocation in 2020. As I mentioned before, we ended 2019 with a $60 million balance remaining under our latest buyback program, which has now been completed in 2020. Adjusting for that 2019 carryover, we have $1.35 billion in 2020 capital remaining to be allocated, to which we then apply our framework of 50% return of shareholder capital and 50% toward potential value-accretive investment opportunities. $675 million will be returned to shareholders in 2020 via our increased dividend for $295 million, and the balance of $380 million through ongoing share repurchases, of which we have executed $62 million year-to-date. 
The remaining 50% of excess capital is available for potential investment opportunities, of which only $61 million are currently identified. As shown in the box below the chart, this consists of the balance of cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan; our ongoing commitment to legacy GenOn pension obligations; and costs associated with readying the site of our retired Encina generating station in California to be marketed for redevelopment. This site is located in San Diego County and is a prime location for real estate development. 
As with our successful sale of the Potrero site outside San Francisco just a few years ago, the Encina represents a similar compelling opportunity for monetization. 
The balance of $614 million in unallocated capital remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value-enhancing opportunities, which exceed both our hurdle rate as well as the opportunity cost of our own stock, we intend to allocate any remaining balance of this capital to our shareholders. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13. Based on 2019 actual results, we ended the year near the midpoint of our target investment-grade metric range. For 2020, we remain on track to further strengthen our investment-grade credit metrics to 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of achieving investment-grade credit metrics for NRG. Importantly, we expect to achieve these results without the need for additional capital allocation toward debt reduction. And we continue to believe that the combination of our stable cash flows and strong credit metrics, along with the continued execution, places us in a position to build on our recent ratings upgrade toward achieving investment-grade ratings over the next 12 to 18 months. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2020 priorities and expectations. As always, our top priority remains delivering on our financial and operational objectives and adhering to our capital allocation principles. 
In addition to completing our Transformation Plan, we remain focused on further perfecting and growing our business. This means rebalancing our current portfolio through additional asset optimization efforts and growing our customer base with compelling retail products, supported by capital-light generation supply. 
With a large asset sales completed, we're looking at further optimizing single assets and our real estate portfolio at large. An example of that is what we're doing at the Encina site, getting it ready for commercial redevelopment and the development and sale of Canal 3. These type of projects are generally highly accretive, don't use permanent capital and further simplify our story. We will also continue to enhance and simplify our disclosures to better align with the way we manage our integrated business. In the next earnings call, we will provide additional disclosures around our ERCOT platform. 
Finally, and like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it simpler and more predictable, while consistently returning significant capital to shareholders. I am very excited for 2020 and the future of our company, and I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. 
With that, Towanda, we're now ready to open the line for questions."

So we're constantly and continuously going to evaluate our generation portfolio in light of that priority. California is less strategic, less core because we don't have a retail business.

I would say that I agree with Mauricio there that the FERC MOPR ruling was positive for competitive markets and should help mitigate some of the impact of handouts to some local utilities. You're talking about states pulling out. Arguably, that's the FRR process. And I think as states look at that, they may see that the FRR is an inferior alternative for consumers to a region-wide capacity market. 
I mean, if you look at the history of FRRs, they have consistently cost the consumers in that area 3 to 10x the prevailing auction rate. They shift risk onto a cap to a set of ratepayers, lock in the local monopoly. The latest numbers I saw from the IMM indicates that the nukes that are getting this X right now are profitable without them, so it's unclear to me why an FRR would be the choice of anybody except the ones receiving those subsidies. 
So, yes, there's obviously a lot of smoke around this right now, and a lot of states are talking about it. But I mean, if you dig into what FRRs have done in the past and what they're expected to do in the future, it doesn't seem like a great idea for me."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of our Operations. 
This earnings call marks the fourth year anniversary since we started a new direction for NRG. We have accomplished many things together. We refocused and streamlined our business to better serve our customers. We significantly reduced our total debt and strengthened our balance sheet, which is now on a path to an investment-grade rating. We provided discipline and transparency on how we invest our capital. And most importantly, we have done it the right way for our employees and our stakeholders.  The company has never been stronger or with a brighter future than it is today. 
I'd like to start by highlighting the key messages for the quarter on Slide 3. First, our integrated business delivered EBITDA in line with our 2019 expectations during a period of volatile market conditions, further validating the benefits of integration between retail and wholesale. As such, we're also reaffirming 2020 guidance. 
Second, we have a comprehensive sustainability framework with industry-leading carbon reduction goals. Given that I view this framework as foundational to our business and an integral part of our long-term strategy, I will provide additional detail later in the presentation. 
And third, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy by adhering to our principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. 
Moving to the business and financial highlights on Slide 4. Beginning with our 2019 scorecard on the left-hand side of the slide, we executed well on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results despite challenging market conditions during the summer. We also had our best safety year ever, marking this the second back-to-back years of record performance. Congratulations to all my colleagues for this remarkable accomplishment. 
With respect to our Transformation Plan, we deliver on our goals. We have now completed over 90% of the plan with all cost savings and working capital completed and $80 million of additional margin enhancing -- enhancement remaining to be achieved in 2020. 
After 2 years of focusing on rightsizing the business and strengthening our balance sheet, in 2019, we focused on perfecting our integrated business. We signed 1.6 gigawatts of medium-term solar PPAs in ERCOT; returned our Gregory plant to service ahead of the summer; and acquired Stream Energy, adding important capabilities to our retail portfolio. 
We also announced the acceleration of our science-based carbon reduction goals to align with guidance from the new intergovernmental panel on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, so as to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
Finally, we continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles and provided additional transparency into our long-term capital allocation plan. In 2019, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also announced the increase of the dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, with the first payment made in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's with a positive outlook, moving us closer to our goal of a solid investment-grade rating. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, similar to how we have presented the financials throughout the year, EBITDA is shown on a same-store basis, adjusted for asset sales and deconsolidations. We ended the year with $1.977 billion of EBITDA or 24% higher than last year. While we deliver on EBITDA, our free cash flow came in below our expected range due to timing issues with Kirk -- which Kirk will address in greater detail later in the presentation. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to talk to you about our comprehensive sustainability framework. It is one that expands across our business from operations and employees to customers and suppliers. Sustainability is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. 
Beginning on Slide 5, our sustainability philosophy is guided by 3 core principles: accountability, transparency and engagement. 
So let me start with accountability. Good intentions are just not enough. We need goals that are clear and measurable. We have a few examples in this slide, including safety, environmental responsibility and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
You have heard me say this before. Safety is our #1 priority. We measure and report our safety performance every quarter, and we hold ourselves accountable to top decile performance. In this way, we're able to take corrective actions to improve our performance in periods where we fall below our standards. Like safety, we have many other goals across our business that measure, not just what we do, but how we do it, including our carbon reduction goals, which I will address in more detail in the next slide. 
Measurable goals are important, but we also need to communicate our progress in a clear and transparent way. We do this every year with the release of our Sustainability Report. We were the first and only company in our sector to comply with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, back in 2016. We were one of the first companies to publicly commit to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD. And recently, we were awarded leadership level across all 3 carbon disclosure project, or CDP programs, on climate risk, water security and supply chain engagement. 
Finally, we are committed to engaging and investing in the communities where we live and do business, from major cities where -- with large concentrations of customers to smaller communities that are home to our power plants and employees. In 2019 alone, we donated to almost 700 organizations. But we aren't just focused on monetary donations. We're also investing our time in the communities with over 11,000 volunteer hours by our employees across 264 organizations. 
We also participate with organizations like CECP, where we presented our sustainability framework and long-term strategy to investors. This engagement is something that makes us very proud and defines us as a company. 
Now let me turn to Slide 6. I want to talk to you about our decarbonization efforts as we transition our business away from traditional generation and closer to the retail customer. In September of last year, we accelerated our carbon reduction goals to conform with the 1.5-degree trajectory. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and to be net 0 by 2050. These goals are some of the most ambitious in the sector, and we're proud with the progress that we have made to date. We are already 83% of the way to our 2025 goal with clear line of sight to achieve it with our current portfolio. 
Although our baseline is 2014, we have been decarbonizing our fleet since 2010, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in just the last 10 years. That is the equivalent of taking 9 million cars off the road every year. As you can see, our actions move the needle. We will continue to share our progress and plans in the months to come. 
From an earnings perspective, as we progress toward decarbonization, coal generation is contributing less and less to our earnings. Moving to the right side of the slide. In just the last 6 years, coal as a percentage of our total revenues has decreased 55%, and that is inclusive of capacity revenues. This is an important distinction as energy revenues have been the bulk of the decline and our coal assets in the East now act primarily as insurance for grid reliability and not for electric generation. 
Finally, sustainability is an integral part of our culture and incorporated in our -- incorporated it in our strategic decisions. We continue to take concrete actions to limit our own carbon footprint while also providing customers with cleaner energy choices, such as electricity plants from renewable resources. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future and be on the lookout for the release of our annual Sustainability Report in early May. 
Now turning to Slide 7, I want to provide you a brief update on our core markets. Beginning on the left side of the slide, as you can see on the chart, electric demand in ERCOT continues to grow at the fastest pace in the nation, between 2% and 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Now as you all know, the direct result of this robust load growth is a record tight supply-demand balance or reserve margin. This requires a tremendous amount of generation investments simply to maintain the current low reserve margin. 
As a large participant in the market, we are looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium-term PPAs. These PPAs enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. 
From an overall market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable build cycle. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we are seeing steady progress in all of our core markets with FERC, ISOs and states, addressing the current market design and adapting it to the evolved grid of the future. While progress has not been perfect, we support efforts that create durable markets that benefit consumers and foster the transition to a cleaner and sustainable energy future. 
In ERCOT, regulators continue to refine their scarcity pricing mechanism to incentivize new generation, which is predominantly renewable and intermittent, while adequately compensating existing resources that provide firm or dispatchable generation. 
In the East, FERC issued a ruling on the PJM capacity market proceeding, which resulted from its finding that current market design is unjust and unreasonable. This ruling seeks to correctly account for resources that receive state subsidies, particularly out-of-markets nuclear subsidies that stifle development of renewable energy and distorts the integrity of competitive markets. This ruling is just the most recent in a series of market reforms that PJM and FERC have undertaken since 2004 to protect the integrity of competitive markets. 
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 8. You can see that our track record is directly in line with our road map to value creation of stabilize, rightsize and now, redefine our company. 
During 2019, we achieved our investment-grade credit metric target. We announced the highly accretive Stream retail transaction and closed it within 3 months. And in line with my commitment to returning capital, we increased our dividend tenfold and executed $1.44 billion in share repurchases. 
For our 2020 capital allocation plan, we are already executing. We paid our first dividend under our recently announced $1.20 per share, with 7% to 9% annual growth dividend policy. We have already begun executing share repurchases under our current $400 million share buyback program, consistent with the 50% return of capital commitment. And like in 2019, and every year since I took over as CEO, you can expect disciplined and timely allocation of our excess uncommitted capital as we earn it throughout the year. 
Last, I want to remind everyone about our capital allocation framework on the right side of the slide. As you can see on the waterfall, we remain committed to maintaining top decile safety and operational excellence. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet, having now achieved investment-grade credit metrics. And last quarter, we provided enhanced visibility into our long-term capital return philosophy. At least 50% will be returned through a mix of dividends and share repurchases. For the other 50%, we remain committed to our growth investment criteria which must meet or exceed our financial thresholds and be consistent with our core strategy or it will be returned to shareholders. 
Now given that the seasonality of our cash flows and liquidity ultimately inform capital allocation, it is my intention for the 50% return of capital to be allocated more programmatically with the dividend paid quarterly and share repurchases throughout the year. 
In the risk of being redundant, as we have consistently said on nearly every earnings call and every meeting, we are committed to being prudent allocators of shareholder capital. We will continue to demonstrate our discipline by adhering to our stated principles and allocate capital to opportunities that maximizes long-term value for your investment. That's our mindset. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus",1156,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus 2018, largely due to higher supply costs in the ERCOT region. 
Highlighting the benefits of our integrated platform, higher wholesale prices, particularly in ERCOT, benefited our Generation segment, which delivered $1.057 billion in 2019. Moreover, as our prior year 2018 generation results included approximately $180 million in EBITDA from assets subsequently sold, as well as Agua Caliente and Ivanpah results prior to their deconsolidation. 
On a same-store basis, our 2019 generation EBITDA results represented over a $400 million year-over-year increase in EBITDA. 
Our consolidated 2019 results also include the benefit of the full run rate of $590 million in cost savings as well as $135 million of margin enhancement from our Transformation Plan. 2019 free cash flow before growth was $1.212 billion. Although these results represent a $92 million increase over 2018, free cash flow fell short of our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion due to the impact of a delay in the timing of certain cash flow items, which will now contribute to 2020 free cash flow. 
In total, on a net basis, the impact of these timing-related items was approximately $60 million. The largest component of these items was the delay in the receipt of $34 million in AMT credit refunds due to NRG in 2019 as a result of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act. NRG filed the required documentation associated with these refunds on time, and we fully expect to receive them in 2020. The balance of the net timing impact primarily consists of other working capital-related items which we now expect in 2020. And as a result, the full amount of the $60 million will be realized in this year. 
Turning to an update on share repurchase activity. We completed the latest $250 million share repurchase program announced in 2019 and have now turned toward executing on programmatic share repurchases in 2020 as a part of our revised capital allocation framework announced last quarter. This framework includes our commitment to returning at least 50% of the annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of our increased dividend and ongoing share repurchases. As a result, in 2020, we expect to execute on approximately $380 million of incremental share repurchases, which I'll explain in greater detail in a few moments. 
In 2019, we reduced debt by $600 million and achieved our target investment-grade metrics for the year. We also realized an important milestone as we continue toward our goal to align our ratings with our credit metrics and our reduced risk profile, as we received an upgrade from Moody's to Ba1, 1 notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook. 
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted -- consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, and consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a final summary of 2019 capital allocation, with changes since our prior update highlighted in blue. After adjusting for 2019 actual cash flow results, our total 2019 excess capital available was $2.845 billion, and was allocated as follows: just over $700 million, or approximately 25%, was used to fund reductions in total debt in order to achieve our target investment-grade metrics; $1.44 billion, representing just over 50% of total capital, was used to fund share repurchases during 2019. 
We ended the year with $60 million remaining under the most recent $250 million buyback program and have completed these repurchases during early 2020. Dividends in 2019, under the prior dividend policy, represented the balance of return of shareholder capital, and, of course, will represent a significantly more robust component of capital allocation going forward. $551 million was allocated to growth and other investments or approximately a $30 million increase versus our prior update, reflecting M&A fees and other integration costs associated with our retail acquisition. 
After a slight shift in Transformation Plan cost to achieve from 2019 to 2020, we ended 2019 with $35 million in unallocated capital, which will be part of the 2020 summary. And I'll now turn to that on Slide 12. 
As shown on the left of Slide 12, the combination of $35 million carried over from 2019, plus the midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance, leads to just over $1.4 billion in capital available for allocation in 2020. As I mentioned before, we ended 2019 with a $60 million balance remaining under our latest buyback program, which has now been completed in 2020. Adjusting for that 2019 carryover, we have $1.35 billion in 2020 capital remaining to be allocated, to which we then apply our framework of 50% return of shareholder capital and 50% toward potential value-accretive investment opportunities. $675 million will be returned to shareholders in 2020 via our increased dividend for $295 million, and the balance of $380 million through ongoing share repurchases, of which we have executed $62 million year-to-date. 
The remaining 50% of excess capital is available for potential investment opportunities, of which only $61 million are currently identified. As shown in the box below the chart, this consists of the balance of cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan; our ongoing commitment to legacy GenOn pension obligations; and costs associated with readying the site of our retired Encina generating station in California to be marketed for redevelopment. This site is located in San Diego County and is a prime location for real estate development. 
As with our successful sale of the Potrero site outside San Francisco just a few years ago, the Encina represents a similar compelling opportunity for monetization. 
The balance of $614 million in unallocated capital remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value-enhancing opportunities, which exceed both our hurdle rate as well as the opportunity cost of our own stock, we intend to allocate any remaining balance of this capital to our shareholders. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13. Based on 2019 actual results, we ended the year near the midpoint of our target investment-grade metric range. For 2020, we remain on track to further strengthen our investment-grade credit metrics to 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of achieving investment-grade credit metrics for NRG. Importantly, we expect to achieve these results without the need for additional capital allocation toward debt reduction. And we continue to believe that the combination of our stable cash flows and strong credit metrics, along with the continued execution, places us in a position to build on our recent ratings upgrade toward achieving investment-grade ratings over the next 12 to 18 months. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2020 priorities and expectations. As always, our top priority remains delivering on our financial and operational objectives and adhering to our capital allocation principles. 
In addition to completing our Transformation Plan, we remain focused on further perfecting and growing our business. This means rebalancing our current portfolio through additional asset optimization efforts and growing our customer base with compelling retail products, supported by capital-light generation supply. 
With the large asset sales completed, we're looking at further optimizing single assets and our real estate portfolio at large. An example of that is what we're doing at the Encina site, getting it ready for commercial redevelopment and the development and sale of Canal 3. These type of projects are generally highly accretive, don't use permanent capital and further simplify our story. We will also continue to enhance and simplify our disclosures to better align with the way we manage our integrated business. In the next earnings call, we will provide additional disclosures around our ERCOT platform. 
Finally, and like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it simpler and more predictable, while consistently returning significant capital to shareholders. I am very excited for 2020 and the future of our company, and I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG.

So we're constantly and continuously going to evaluate our generation portfolio in light of that priority. California is less strategic, less core because we don't have a retail business.

I would say that I agree with Mauricio there that the FERC MOPR ruling was positive for competitive markets and should help mitigate some of the impact of handouts to some local utilities. You're talking about states pulling out. Arguably, that's the FRR process. And I think as states look at that, they may see that the FRR is an inferior alternative for consumers to a region-wide capacity market. 
I mean, if you look at the history of FRRs, they have consistently cost the consumers in that area 3 to 10x the prevailing auction rate. They shift risk onto a cap to a set of ratepayers, lock in the local monopoly. The latest numbers I saw from the IMM indicates that the nukes that are getting this X right now are profitable without them, so it's unclear to me why an FRR would be the choice of anybody except the ones receiving those subsidies. 
So, yes, there's obviously a lot of smoke around this right now, and a lot of states are talking about it. But I mean, if you dig into what FRRs have done in the past and what they're expected to do in the future, it doesn't seem like a great idea for me."

So having said that, I -- there are some areas of opportunities that are consistent with our long-term strategy. 
I will say that retail, while there has been a lot of consolidation, there's still some opportunities, I would say, in the small to medium-sized companies. And given the scale that we have and the scope of our operational platform, we can achieve significant synergies when looking at these opportunities. I don't see the same attractive opportunities in the generation side, that's why we have been executing on our capital-light PPA strategy. 
So I mean, I don't disagree with you. I mean, particularly with the recent performance of our stock price, it makes it so much harder to allocate capital to growth, or in this case, it makes the probability of reallocating that capital from growth to share buybacks much more probable."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of our Retail Mass business; and Chris Moser, Head of our Operations. 
This earnings call marks the fourth year anniversary since we started a new direction for NRG. We have accomplished many things together. We refocused and streamlined our business to better serve our customers. We significantly reduced our total debt and strengthened our balance sheet, which is now on a path to an investment-grade rating. We provided discipline and transparency on how we invest our capital. And most importantly, we have done it the right way for our employees and our stakeholders. The company has never been stronger or with a brighter future than it is today. 
I'd like to start by highlighting the key messages for the quarter on Slide 3. First, our integrated business delivered EBITDA in line with our 2019 expectations during a period of volatile market conditions, further validating the benefits of integration between retail and wholesale. As such, we're also reaffirming 2020 guidance. 
Second, we have a comprehensive sustainability framework with industry-leading carbon reduction goals. Given that I view this framework as foundational to our business and an integral part of our long-term strategy, I will provide additional detail later in the presentation. 
And third, we continue to execute our capital allocation strategy by adhering to our principles and our commitment to being excellent stewards of shareholder capital. 
Moving to the business and financial highlights on Slide 4. Beginning with our 2019 scorecard on the left-hand side of the slide, we executed well on all our priorities. We delivered strong financial and operational results despite challenging market conditions during the summer. We also had our best safety year ever, marking this the second back-to-back years of record performance. Congratulations to all my colleagues for this remarkable accomplishment. 
With respect to our Transformation Plan, we deliver on our goals. We have now completed over 90% of the plan with all cost savings and working capital completed and $80 million of additional margin enhancing -- enhancement remaining to be achieved in 2020. 
After 2 years of focusing on rightsizing the business and strengthening our balance sheet, in 2019, we focused on perfecting our integrated business. We signed 1.6 gigawatts of medium-term solar PPAs in ERCOT; returned our Gregory plant to service ahead of the summer; and acquired Stream Energy, adding important capabilities to our retail portfolio. 
We also announced the acceleration of our science-based carbon reduction goals to align with guidance from the new intergovernmental panel on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, so as to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 
Finally, we continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles and provided additional transparency into our long-term capital allocation plan. In 2019, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also announced the increase of the dividend from $0.12 per share to $1.20 per share, with the first payment made in the first quarter of 2020. 
During the fourth quarter, we received an upgrade from Moody's with a positive outlook, moving us closer to our goal of a solid investment-grade rating. 
On the right-hand side of the slide, similar to how we have presented the financials throughout the year, EBITDA is shown on a same-store basis, adjusted for asset sales and deconsolidations. We ended the year with $1.977 billion of EBITDA or 24% higher than last year. While we deliver on EBITDA, our free cash flow came in below our expected range due to timing issues with Kirk -- which Kirk will address in greater detail later in the presentation. 
On the next 2 slides, I want to talk to you about our comprehensive sustainability framework. It is one that expands across our business from operations and employees to customers and suppliers. Sustainability is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. 
Beginning on Slide 5, our sustainability philosophy is guided by 3 core principles: accountability, transparency and engagement. 
So let me start with accountability. Good intentions are just not enough. We need goals that are clear and measurable. We have a few examples in this slide, including safety, environmental responsibility and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. 
You have heard me say this before. Safety is our #1 priority. We measure and report our safety performance every quarter, and we hold ourselves accountable to top decile performance. In this way, we're able to take corrective actions to improve our performance in periods where we fall below our standards. Like safety, we have many other goals across our business that measure, not just what we do, but how we do it, including our carbon reduction goals, which I will address in more detail in the next slide. 
Measurable goals are important, but we also need to communicate our progress in a clear and transparent way. We do this every year with the release of our Sustainability Report. We were the first and only company in our sector to comply with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, back in 2016. We were one of the first companies to publicly commit to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD. And recently, we were awarded leadership level across all 3 carbon disclosure project, or CDP programs, on climate risk, water security and supply chain engagement. 
Finally, we are committed to engaging and investing in the communities where we live and do business, from major cities where -- with large concentrations of customers to smaller communities that are home to our power plants and employees. In 2019 alone, we donated to almost 700 organizations. But we aren't just focused on monetary donations. We're also investing our time in the communities with over 11,000 volunteer hours by our employees across 264 organizations. 
We also participate with organizations like CECP, where we presented our sustainability framework and long-term strategy to investors. This engagement is something that makes us very proud and defines us as a company. 
Now let me turn to Slide 6. I want to talk to you about our decarbonization efforts as we transition our business away from traditional generation and closer to the retail customer. In September of last year, we accelerated our carbon reduction goals to conform with the 1.5-degree trajectory. This means reducing our carbon emissions 50% by 2025 and to be net 0 by 2050. These goals are some of the most ambitious in the sector, and we're proud with the progress that we have made to date. We are already 83% of the way to our 2025 goal with clear line of sight to achieve it with our current portfolio. 
Although our baseline is 2014, we have been decarbonizing our fleet since 2010, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 40 million metric tons in just the last 10 years. That is the equivalent of taking 9 million cars off the road every year. As you can see, our actions move the needle. We will continue to share our progress and plans in the months to come. 
From an earnings perspective, as we progress toward decarbonization, coal generation is contributing less and less to our earnings. Moving to the right side of the slide. In just the last 6 years, coal as a percentage of our total revenues has decreased 55%, and that is inclusive of capacity revenues. This is an important distinction as energy revenues have been the bulk of the decline and our coal assets in the East now act primarily as insurance for grid reliability and not for electric generation. 
Finally, sustainability is an integral part of our culture and incorporated in our -- incorporated it in our strategic decisions. We continue to take concrete actions to limit our own carbon footprint while also providing customers with cleaner energy choices, such as electricity plants from renewable resources. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the future and be on the lookout for the release of our annual Sustainability Report in early May. 
Now turning to Slide 7, I want to provide you a brief update on our core markets. Beginning on the left side of the slide, as you can see on the chart, electric demand in ERCOT continues to grow at the fastest pace in the nation, between 2% and 3% per year for the foreseeable future. Now as you all know, the direct result of this robust load growth is a record tight supply/demand balance or reserve margin. This requires a tremendous amount of generation investments simply to maintain the current low reserve margin. 
As a large participant in the market, we are looking to facilitate solar newbuilds to improve reliability and rebalance our portfolio by entering into medium-term PPAs. These PPAs enable the developers to obtain cost-effective financing and tax equity to economically develop the project. And for us, they complement our generation profile, lower our cost structure and allows us to better serve our customers. 
From an overall market perspective, we expect ERCOT to remain tight and volatile for the foreseeable future. Our integrated platform is well positioned to thrive during this volatile and emerging renewable build cycle. 
Moving to the right side of the slide, we are seeing steady progress in all of our core markets with FERC, ISOs and states, addressing the current market design and adapting it to the evolved grid of the future. While progress has not been perfect, we support efforts that create durable markets that benefit consumers and foster the transition to a cleaner and sustainable energy future. 
In ERCOT, regulators continue to refine their scarcity pricing mechanism to incentivize new generation, which is predominantly renewable and intermittent, while adequately compensating existing resources that provide firm or dispatchable generation. 
In the East, FERC issued a ruling on the PJM capacity market proceeding, which resulted from its finding that current market design is unjust and unreasonable. This ruling seeks to correctly account for resources that receive state subsidies, particularly out-of-markets nuclear subsidies that stifle development of renewable energy and distorts the integrity of competitive markets. This ruling is just the most recent in a series of market reforms that PJM and FERC have undertaken since 2004 to protect the integrity of competitive markets. 
Moving to capital allocation on Slide 8. You can see that our track record is directly in line with our road map to value creation of stabilize, rightsize and now redefine our company. 
During 2019, we achieved our investment-grade credit metric target. We announced the highly accretive Stream retail transaction and closed it within 3 months. And in line with my commitment to returning capital, we increased our dividend tenfold and executed $1.44 billion in share repurchases. 
For our 2020 capital allocation plan, we are already executing. We paid our first dividend under our recently announced $1.20 per share, with 7% to 9% annual growth dividend policy. We have already begun executing share repurchases under our current $400 million share buyback program, consistent with the 50% return of capital commitment. And like in 2019, and every year since I took over as CEO, you can expect disciplined and timely allocation of our excess uncommitted capital as we earn it throughout the year. 
Last, I want to remind everyone about our capital allocation framework on the right side of the slide. As you can see on the waterfall, we remain committed to maintaining top decile safety and operational excellence. We will continue to have a strong balance sheet, having now achieved investment-grade credit metrics. And last quarter, we provided enhanced visibility into our long-term capital return philosophy. At least 50% will be returned through a mix of dividends and share repurchases. For the other 50%, we remain committed to our growth investment criteria which must meet or exceed our financial thresholds and be consistent with our core strategy or it will be returned to shareholders. 
Now given that the seasonality of our cash flows and liquidity ultimately inform capital allocation, it is my intention for the 50% return of capital to be allocated more programmatically with the dividend paid quarterly and share repurchases throughout the year. 
In the risk of being redundant, as we have consistently said on nearly every earnings call and every meeting, we are committed to being prudent allocators of shareholder capital. We will continue to demonstrate our discipline by adhering to our stated principles and allocate capital to opportunities that maximizes long-term value for your investment. That's our mindset. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus",1156,"Thank you, Mauricio. Turning to the financial summary on Slide 10, NRG finished 2019 with $1.977 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.212 billion in free cash flow before growth. Retail delivered $920 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $32 million decrease versus 2018, largely due to higher supply costs in the ERCOT region. 
Highlighting the benefits of our integrated platform, higher wholesale prices, particularly in ERCOT, benefited our Generation segment, which delivered $1.057 billion in 2019. Moreover, as our prior year 2018 generation results included approximately $180 million in EBITDA from assets subsequently sold as well as Agua Caliente and Ivanpah results prior to their deconsolidation. 
On a same-store basis, our 2019 generation EBITDA results represented over a $400 million year-over-year increase in EBITDA. 
Our consolidated 2019 results also include the benefit of the full run rate of $590 million in cost savings as well as $135 million of margin enhancement from our Transformation Plan. 2019 free cash flow before growth was $1.212 billion. Although these results represent a $92 million increase over 2018, free cash flow fell short of our guidance range of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion due to the impact of a delay in the timing of certain cash flow items, which will now contribute to 2020 free cash flow. 
In total, on a net basis, the impact of these timing-related items was approximately $60 million. The largest component of these items was the delay in the receipt of $34 million in AMT credit refunds due to NRG in 2019 as a result of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act. NRG filed the required documentation associated with these refunds on time, and we fully expect to receive them in 2020. The balance of the net timing impact primarily consists of other working capital-related items which we now expect in 2020. And as a result, the full amount of the $60 million will be realized in this year. 
Turning to an update on share repurchase activity. We completed the latest $250 million share repurchase program announced in 2019 and have now turned toward executing on programmatic share repurchases in 2020 as a part of our revised capital allocation framework announced last quarter. This framework includes our commitment to returning at least 50% of the annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of our increased dividend and ongoing share repurchases. As a result, in 2020, we expect to execute on approximately $380 million of incremental share repurchases, which I'll explain in greater detail in a few moments. 
In 2019, we reduced debt by $600 million and achieved our target investment-grade metrics for the year. We also realized an important milestone as we continue toward our goal to align our ratings with our credit metrics and our reduced risk profile, as we received an upgrade from Moody's to Ba1, 1 notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook. 
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we are reaffirming our 2020 adjusted -- consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, and consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance of $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion. 
Turning to Slide 12 for a final summary of 2019 capital allocation, with changes since our prior update highlighted in blue. After adjusting for 2019 actual cash flow results, our total 2019 excess capital available was $2.845 billion, and was allocated as follows: just over $700 million, or approximately 25%, was used to fund reductions in total debt in order to achieve our target investment-grade metrics; $1.44 billion, representing just over 50% of total capital, was used to fund share repurchases during 2019. 
We ended the year with $60 million remaining under the most recent $250 million buyback program and have completed these repurchases during early 2020. Dividends in 2019, under the prior dividend policy, represented the balance of return of shareholder capital, and, of course, will represent a significantly more robust component of capital allocation going forward. $551 million was allocated to growth and other investments or approximately a $30 million increase versus our prior update, reflecting M&A fees and other integration costs associated with our retail acquisition. 
After a slight shift in Transformation Plan cost to achieve from 2019 to 2020, we ended 2019 with $35 million in unallocated capital, which will be part of the 2020 summary. And I'll now turn to that on Slide 12. 
As shown on the left of Slide 12, the combination of $35 million carried over from 2019, plus the midpoint of our 2020 free cash flow guidance, leads to just over $1.4 billion in capital available for allocation in 2020. As I mentioned before, we ended 2019 with a $60 million balance remaining under our latest buyback program, which has now been completed in 2020. Adjusting for that 2019 carryover, we have $1.35 billion in 2020 capital remaining to be allocated, to which we then apply our framework of 50% return of shareholder capital and 50% toward potential value-accretive investment opportunities. $675 million will be returned to shareholders in 2020 via our increased dividend for $295 million, and the balance of $380 million through ongoing share repurchases, of which we have executed $62 million year-to-date. 
The remaining 50% of excess capital is available for potential investment opportunities, of which only $61 million are currently identified. As shown in the box below the chart, this consists of the balance of cost to achieve associated with the Transformation Plan; our ongoing commitment to legacy GenOn pension obligations; and costs associated with readying the site of our retired Encina generating station in California to be marketed for redevelopment. This site is located in San Diego County and is a prime location for real estate development. 
As with our successful sale of the Potrero site outside San Francisco just a few years ago, the Encina represents a similar compelling opportunity for monetization. 
The balance of $614 million in unallocated capital remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value-enhancing opportunities, which exceed both our hurdle rate as well as the opportunity cost of our own stock, we intend to allocate any remaining balance of this capital to our shareholders. 
Finally, turning to Slide 13. Based on 2019 actual results, we ended the year near the midpoint of our target investment-grade metric range. For 2020, we remain on track to further strengthen our investment-grade credit metrics to 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA, making 2020 the second year of achieving investment-grade credit metrics for NRG. Importantly, we expect to achieve these results without the need for additional capital allocation toward debt reduction. And we continue to believe that the combination of our stable cash flows and strong credit metrics, along with the continued execution, places us in a position to build on our recent ratings upgrade toward achieving investment-grade ratings over the next 12 to 18 months. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2020 priorities and expectations. As always, our top priority remains delivering on our financial and operational objectives and adhering to our capital allocation principles. 
In addition to completing our Transformation Plan, we remain focused on further perfecting and growing our business. This means rebalancing our current portfolio through additional asset optimization efforts and growing our customer base with compelling retail products, supported by capital-light generation supply. 
With the large asset sales completed, we're looking at further optimizing single assets and our real estate portfolio at large. An example of that is what we're doing at the Encina site, getting it ready for commercial redevelopment and the development and sale of Canal 3. These type of projects are generally highly accretive, don't use permanent capital and further simplify our story. We will also continue to enhance and simplify our disclosures to better align with the way we manage our integrated business. In the next earnings call, we will provide additional disclosures around our ERCOT platform. 
Finally, and like I said earlier, our company today is stronger than it has ever been. We have the financial flexibility to continue perfecting our platform to make it simpler and more predictable, while consistently returning significant capital to shareholders. I am very excited for 2020 and the future of our company, and I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG.

So either we grow retail or we reduce our generation position, and we're evaluating that. 
Now keep in mind that the model that we have going forward is we really want generation that serves a purpose, and that purpose is to better serve our customers in the most cost-efficient way. So we're constantly and continuously going to evaluate our generation portfolio in light of that priority. California is less strategic, less core because we don't have a retail business. So while we have benefited from an increasing capacity price in California, we're going to continuously evaluate that portfolio through the lenses of our long-term strategic goals."

I would say that I agree with Mauricio there that the FERC MOPR ruling was positive for competitive markets and should help mitigate some of the impact of handouts to some local utilities. You're talking about states pulling out. Arguably, that's the FRR process. And I think as states look at that, they may see that the FRR is an inferior alternative for consumers to a region-wide capacity market. 
I mean if you look at the history of FRRs, they have consistently cost the consumers in that area 3 to 10x the prevailing auction rate. They shift risk onto a cap to a set of ratepayers, lock in the local monopoly. The latest numbers I saw from the IMM indicates that the nukes that are getting this X right now are profitable without them, so it's unclear to me why an FRR would be the choice of anybody except the ones receiving those subsidies. 
So, yes, there's obviously a lot of smoke around this right now, and a lot of states are talking about it. But I mean, if you dig into what FRRs have done in the past and what they're expected to do in the future, it doesn't seem like a great idea for me."

I will say that retail, while there has been a lot of consolidation, there's still some opportunities, I would say, in the small to medium-sized companies. And given the scale that we have and the scope of our operational platform, we can achieve significant synergies when looking at these opportunities. I don't see the same attractive opportunities in the generation side, that's why we have been executing on our capital-light PPA strategy. 
So I mean, I don't disagree with you. I mean particularly with the recent performance of our stock price, it makes it so much harder to allocate capital to growth, or in this case, it makes the probability of reallocating that capital from growth to share buybacks much more probable."

I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to say from everyone at NRG, we sincerely hope that you and your families are well and our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It has never been clear how critical electricity is to our way of life. And now more than ever, our communities are relying on the service that we provide to homes and businesses. I want to thank our essential employees who are on the front lines safely operating our power plants and supporting our customers. These employees continue to impress me every day with their commitment and courage during this unprecedented time. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's call: First, we initiated a comprehensive response to COVID-19, focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our #1 priority remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, so they can safely deliver electricity and keep the lights on for our customers and communities; second, given the changes that we have made to our integrated business, we were able to deliver strong results during the first quarter and reaffirm our full year financial guidance; third, and as we promised on our February earnings call, we are providing enhanced disclosures on our business, including the introduction of the integrated regional segments. 
Turning to Slide 4. I want to talk to you in greater detail about our response to COVID-19. As you know, our top priority has been protecting the safety and wellbeing of our employees. On January 21, 1 day after the first confirmed U.S. case, we activated our crisis management team to ensure we were prepared for any scenario. On March 17, we closed our offices and transition employees to remote work. We have remained fully operational during this time with over 95% of our office personnel working remotely. 
While we closed our offices to nonessential personnel, we also have employees who provide critical or essential services and continue to work at our power plants and offices every day. As part of our commitment to protecting their health and safety, we introduced health screening guidelines for those continuing to work on site, initiated deep cleaning protocols, enacted strict social distancing in guidelines, restricted access to offices and power plants and implemented staggered staffing for essential functions. 
We have also expanded health benefits for all employees to include access to virtual doctors and awarded brands from our NRG employee relief fund. These additional resources are intended to protect our employees and their families. 
With respect to our operations, the impact has been limited. A few outages were delayed due to COVID-19 issues. However, none of them had a material financial impact or reliability implications. Our spring program included 84 outages and a nuclear refueling at SPP, so we are well prepared for the summer months. 
We did stop work at all nonessential projects including our Encina demolition project in California. We have also paused face-to-face retail sales activities to support the safety and wellbeing of our team and communities. Recognizing that some of our customers have been financially impacted by COVID-19, we temporarily paused all late fees and electric disconnects, and offer deferred payment plans to provide temporary relief. We also work closely with the PUCT and other Texas market participants to create a solution that extends additional assistance through mid-July to low-income customers and those facing significant financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. 
In April, we announced a pledge of $2 million to relief efforts aimed at dose on the front lines who needed the most. This includes funding and critical safety supplies to first responders who are in desperate need of personal protective equipment. Community-led relief funds for small businesses, which have been devastated as social distancing and shelter in place guidelines have forced many to close 4 months, and teachers and educators who play such a pivotal role in our communities where we live and work. We have begun activities to return our employees to the new normal operations, prioritizing their safety and wellbeing. 
Now moving on to our financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 5. We achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, almost a 5% increase from the same period last year. These results were driven by the addition of stream energy and margin enhancement initiatives, partially offset by mild weather across our core markets. 
To put the mild weather into context, ERCOT and the Northeast saw temperatures that were 20% and 17% warmer than the 10-year normal for the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full year guidance based on our expectations of a gradual reopening of our economy during the summer and the stability of our integrated platform. But these are unprecedented times, and expect most of the adverse impact from COVID-19 to come from customer payment related items like bad debt. At this point, we estimate that to be around $50 million. We will look at offsetting this impact through prudent cost management and ERCOT's relief fund. 
During the quarter, we implemented our infectious disease and pandemic plan to ensure business continuity as we discussed in the previous slide. We also updated our reporting segments during the quarter, and are providing enhanced disclosures, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. These disclosures are intended to help you think about our business in the same way we manage it. I also believe they will help demonstrate the stability of our ERCOT platform that we have long talked about, but which was difficult to illustrate when retail and generation went out of as a separate businesses. 
Finally, on the last earnings call in late February, I spoke at length about our sustainability program and our commitment to transparency. To that end, we just published our 10th annual sustainability report. Our comprehensive sustainability framework is foundational to the long-term success of our company. One of the key metrics is the speed at which we are decarbonizing in our business. As you will see, we are now 83% of the way to achieving our 2025 goal and have clear line of sight to get there. 
Moving to Slide 6. I want to highlight some of the impacts we are seeing on electric demand in our core markets. In the upper right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load for April. As you can see, electric demand has been impacted across the country with declines anywhere between 6% to 9%. Except in ERCOT, which continues to show resilience, and it is down only 2%. Even within ERCOT, we're seeing significant differences between West Texas and the rest of the state driven primarily by the impact of low oil prices in the Permian region. These differences are not only regional, but also by customer class, as you can see in the lower right-hand side of the slide. Residential demand, which makes up around 30% of ERCOT peak electric demand this time of the year, is up 7% for the month of paper. While small business and C&I have been negatively impacted. 
The point I want to make here is that the impact to specific companies will depend on the customer mix in their portfolios. In our case, we are heavily weighted towards the Texas residential customer. 
Now looking ahead into the summer. Texas already began a partial reopening of the economy. This suggests that the severe impact to small businesses we have seen in April may ease as the economy reopens. Conversely, the impact on the Oil patch may just be getting started. I will simply remind everyone that our largest exposure in ERCOT is to residential demand, and so far, that has been robust. The impact to summer load is difficult to assess at this point. But I can tell you that summer prices will be dependent on wind production and weather. 
Finally, the long-term outlook for ERCOT from our perspective will remain robust. We know that reserve margins are dependent, almost exclusively on new renewables coming online in the next few years. No doubt, COVID-19 and low oil prices will have an impact on demand. It's difficult to know how much at this point. We have no new renewables PPA this quarter, which is indicative of a slowdown in new renewable development. How much these 2 things offset each other is going to determine scarcity prices going forward. 
Now based on where the forward curve is, not much scarcity is assuming the forward prices, which is not helpful for new renewable developments or any new development for that matter. This is why we think reserve margins will be tighter than what we have seen in the CDR. 
So with this market context, I want to review how we are positioned as a company to perform during this unprecedented period on Slide 7. Since I took over as CEO over 4 years ago, we deliberately evolved our business from a highly endeavored IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieve what we view as an investment-grade balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework, and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While the stock price doesn't reflected, we expect all the good work we have done to be reflected in our stable earnings, as we successfully navigate the current downtime. 
As you can see, we rebalanced our portfolio by selling noncore and underperforming assets to better match retail load with generation. By integrating these 2 complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain, we have significantly stabilized our earnings. 
As you can see in the new segments, our business is heavily weighted towards residential consumers, which has proven to be a more resilient group during this period, particularly in Texas. Second, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Last year, we reached our goal of driving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our target investment-grade metric range of 2.5 to 2.75x and through continued operational performance, we expect to drive this ratio to the conservative end of that range this year. We remain in close dialogue with the rating agencies, and we continue to target investment-grade ratings over the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet strength goes well beyond these metrics. We have done a good job in managing our maturity schedule and liquidity. Our next maturity is not until 2024. And each year's maturity is sized to be less than any 1 year's free cash flow. Our liquidity also remained strong at approximately $2 billion. 
Next, on capital allocation, all our actions to stabilize and midsize our business have created tremendous financial flexibility. And now with our deleveraging program behind us, we're focusing all our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our business model and returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we established a longer-term framework built upon a commitment of value creation through disciplined capital allocation across all cycles. With this financial flexibility, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic growth that meets our financial thresholds, and return capital to shareholders through growing our dividend to 7% to 9% combined with programmatic and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, our comprehensive sustainability framework serves as a solid foundation to our portfolio as it is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy and necessary for our long-term success. The bottom line is this, our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We recognize that our business model is unique and relatively new. I look forward to further validating the stability of our platform through our strong execution. 
Today, we're taking 1 additional step in the evolution of our business model, and how we report results. We have moved from having 2 distinct businesses, retail and generation to 1 integrated business with a regional focus. Therefore, we need to realign our segment reporting to match our integrated strategy and the way we operate our company. 
Turning to Slide 8. We're introducing the new regional segments and EBITDA sensitivities. These segments will have the benefit of a common market structure, and importantly, we will better highlight the stability of our ERCOT platform. Also, the new sensitivity now captured the full impact of the integrated business at the EBITDA level. The Texas segment will include all activities in our value chain from customer operations to market and plant operations. In this new format, revenues will be primarily driven by retail, while costs will be either the fuel that we buy for our power plants or the power we purchase from the wholesale market. This is exactly how we manage the business. The integration of these 2 countercyclical businesses results in long-term earnings stability from this segment, which is reinforced by the limited sensitivity to power prices shown in the bottom of the slide. 
The East segment will include all non Texas customer activity and all generation assets in the East. This region is not fully balanced between retail and generation. Therefore, we will continue to have both revenues and cost for each business. Our focus is to better match these 2 parts so we can fully integrate. 
The West and other segment includes the conventional and renewable projects in California, the cotton would lease and our interest in 1 international asset. This segment will only have generation revenue and cost since there is no ability to replicate our integrated model, due to a lack of competitive retail market. Because the East and West segments are not fully integrated, the sensitivity to changes in power prices are not optimized as it is in Texas. We believe this new segment structure better reflects our operations and regional impacts. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

Starting on Slide 10, I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed.

Starting on Slide 10, I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. 
In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2 distinct lines of business, those being retail and generation. Our new segments reflect our integrated regional focus with our customer-facing business as a primary revenue driver and the majority of our generation and associated costs, particularly in ERCOT, supporting our customer load. Our new segment financial results will provide a clearer picture of the EBITDA produced by our integrated segments by geography and is consistent with the way we manage our business, 1 position for each market. 
To help you better understand our historical results in this context, at the top of the slide, we've translated our 2019 results into the new geographical segment as they will be reflected in the components of our guidance going forward. Specifically, the Texas segment includes all of our customer market and plant operations within ERCOT and we will be providing the expected contribution from this segment to our consolidated EBITDA guidance range going forward. We will also be providing the expected contribution to EBITDA guidance from the remaining reporting segments, which include East, West and corporate and are comprised of the remainder of our businesses. 
On the upper right of the slide, you will find our 2019 results recast into these categories as compared to the corresponding results of our 2020 EBITDA guidance range. 
Later today, in addition to filing our 10-Q, we will also be filing an 8-K, which will contain restated financials based on our new segments on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 as well as annually for both 2017 and 2018 in order to further assist you in comparative analysis. You will find some of this information on Slide 21 in the appendix to today's presentation as well. 
The bottom half of the slide provides a bit more color on both the operations within each reporting segment as well as some highlights on the key components of the integrated margins within each. Focusing on Texas, you should be thinking of our revenue line as retail revenue, while our cost to serve is comprised of both fuel costs associated with generation supporting our load and purchase power to support load in excess of economic generation. Going forward, generation revenue in this segment will be minimal. 
In the East, our primary revenue will be from retail sales and capacity. And also include energy revenues from our plants that are not located near our load. The West is exclusively generation, where our thermal assets in California and associated resource adequacy and energy revenue primarily comprising revenues on the income statement. While cost of goods sold will again primarily reflect fuel costs associated with those assets. 
The West segment also includes our interest in the 2 remaining utility-scale projects in California, those being Agua and Ivanpah, as well as our partial interest in our 1 remaining international generating plant in Australia. However, all 3 of these interests are accounted for under the equity method, and our share of the earnings will be reported on a single line in the income statement. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $349 million in adjusted EBITDA and a robust $167 million in free cash flow before growth for the first quarter of 2020. Texas delivered $195 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $19 million increase versus 2019, largely due to the increase in load from the acquisition of Stream, which occurred in the second half of 2019, and  improved margins due to the lower supply costs in Texas. 
The balance of our quarterly results of $154 million from East, West and Corporate was in line overall with last year's results. However, within this, we did have a few items of note worth highlighting for comparative purposes. During 2019, we recognized a onetime gain of $27 million from the settlement of the mid- generation asbestos liability. During Q1 of 2020, due to the drop in oil prices, we wrote down our oil inventories in the East by $29 million, which is a noncash charge to earnings and EBITDA. Offsetting this write-down was the recognition in 2020 of $30 million in outage insurance proceeds related to outages that occurred last year. 
Finally, much improved availability of our Sunrise facility in the West and the lower cost of operations allowed our adjusted EBITDA outside of Texas to remain flat versus 2019. 
We saw no material impact from COVID-19 during the first quarter. However, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, over the balance of the year, we currently anticipate an impact of approximately $50 million due to the effects of the pandemic on customer payments, particularly bad debt expense, which we will look to offset through targeted cost management and the ERCOT relief fund. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. During the first quarter of this year, we received the $60 million in cash flow items I highlighted for you last quarter, which contributed to robust free cash flow before growth of $167 million. Due to the Cares Act, we expect our free cash flow before growth over the balance of the year to further improve from the delay of approximately $17 million of FICA payments into '21 and '22, as well as the acceleration of $11 million of AMT refunds that were previously expected in later years. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure we maintain surplus cash on hand in the event of stress in the banking system, during the quarter, we drew down our revolving credit facility by approximately $550 million to proportionately increase cash on hand. As liquidity in financial markets has improved and we enter the more cash-generative time of the year, we expect to repay the revolver balance back to 0. And since the first quarter, we've already reduced that balance by more than half. 
Finally, turning to an update on share repurchase activity. To date, we have completed $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $33.05, which consists of $60 million in purchases, which was the remaining balance of our 2019 program and $164 million of programmatic repurchases under our new capital allocation policy. 
Finally, turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on capital allocation activity. Our expectations for 2020 are unchanged, with the only item of note being the increase in share repurchases year-to-date, having now executed $164 million in share repurchases under the new capital allocation framework through the first 4 months of this year. We have now completed more than 40% of our targeted share repurchases as a part of our commitment to return 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders, which this year totaled $675 million, including our recently increased dividend. 
The balance of $614 million in remaining capital, shown in green on the right of the slide, remains available for accretive investment opportunities. However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value enhancing opportunities, we intend to allocate the balance of this unallocated capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Mauricio."

And once again, this year provides us a tail event that further demonstrate that stability. So as we have to demonstrate our investors, we also have to demonstrate these 2 rating agencies. They're not that different in that respect. So -- but I'll just hand it to Kirk to talk about the time line. Kirk?"

But overall, our dialogue with the agencies remains active and very positive. I think overall, they continue to be satisfied with both our performance and our strategy. But obviously, as Mauricio alluded to, I mean given the current backdrop and uncertainty in the broader economy, it's not a favorable set of circuses to certainly an immediate upgrade. But I would say the fact that both have maintained our positive outlook underscores their appreciation for our performance and our outlook as well as our balance sheet. And as Mauricio said, look at current events provide an opportunity for us to prove the resilience of our platform under extreme positions, and that would provide us a further argument towards that upgrade. I mean that said, understanding in the near term, I think agencies are likely to take more prudent wait and see, if you will, approach to ratings upgrades. So it's reasonable for us to assume that, that may extend the time line a little bit, maybe 6 months forward. Certainly, that's not our objective or target, but I think we have to be reasonable about the pace given the circumstances we're in. But overall, based on our dialogue with the agencies, we're confident that with continued performance, investment-grade remains achievable at our current leverage level, which were in line with those targets."

I think the important thing is we wanted to quantify so far what is our estimate in terms of the impact of COVID-19. And we are looking at -- we're going to take initiatives, both on the cost management side and the relief on to offset that. Outside of that, I mean, I think it's just there are so many things that we don't control how quickly states open, how quickly people are going to go out.

I mean, I think it is important to recognize that our portfolio in Texas is primarily residential customers. And we have seen actually an increase in demand from those customers. Now as you go into the summer, just recognize that perhaps April, the increased demand is much bigger than what you're going to see in the summer months because in the summer months, you normally already have people using a lot of electricity. I mean, people -- kids are out of school, they come back to. So we don't expect to see the same level of impact as we go into the summer as we have seen in April. So yes, and also, it's going to depend on how quickly the economy comes back, right? I mean, small businesses, perhaps they open gradually, they're not going to open a full capacity at first. So we're assessing that. But I think it's too early to tell to start trying to make some sort of assumptions in terms of what would be the ultimate impact of our -- in our portfolio. 
Obviously, if you have a 6% increase or 7% increase on residential demand for the balance of the year, I mean, that's great for us because we have a pretty significant exposure to it, if that's what you were trying to imply. But I also want to be cautious that there are so many things that we don't control here. We are, I think we are very well positioned. I think we're managing the -- our company and our risk well.

So I wouldn't say that we're -- that we are short. In terms of the sensitivities, I mean, now these are integrated sensitivities at the EBITDA level, which not only is the interaction between generation and retail on a gross margin basis, but also all this some of the other levels that we have to ensure that we optimize these 2 parts of the business.

I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to say from everyone at NRG, we sincerely hope that you and your families are well and our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It has never been clear how critical electricity is to our way of life. And now more than ever, our communities are relying on the service that we provide to homes and businesses. I want to thank our essential employees who are on the front lines safely operating our power plants and supporting our customers. These employees continue to impress me every day with their commitment and courage during this unprecedented time. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's call: First, we initiated a comprehensive response to COVID-19, focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our #1 priority remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, so they can safely deliver electricity and keep the lights on for our customers and communities; second, given the changes that we have made to our integrated business, we were able to deliver strong results during the first quarter and reaffirm our full year financial guidance; third, and as we promised on our February earnings call, we are providing enhanced disclosures on our business, including the introduction of new integrated regional segments. 
Turning to Slide 4. I want to talk to you in greater detail about our response to COVID-19. As you know, our top priority has been protecting the safety and wellbeing of our employees. On January 21, 1 day after the first confirmed U.S. case, we activated our Crisis Management Team to ensure we were prepared for any scenario. On March 17, we closed our offices and transition employees to remote work. We have remained fully operational during this time with over 95% of our office personnel working remotely. 
While we closed our offices to nonessential personnel, we also have employees who provide critical or essential services and continue to work at our power plants and in offices every day. As part of our commitment to protecting their health and safety, we introduced health screening guidelines for those continuing to work on-site, initiated deep cleaning protocols, enacted the strict social distancing guidelines, restricted access to offices and power plants, and implemented staggered staffing for essential functions. 
We have also expanded health benefits for all employees to include access to virtual doctors and awarded brands from our NRG employee relief fund. These additional resources are intended to protect our employees and their families. 
With respect to our operations, the impact has been limited. A few outages were delayed due to COVID-19 issues. However, none of them had a material financial impact or reliability implications. Our spring program included 84 outages and a nuclear refueling at STP, so we are well prepared for the summer months. 
We did stop work at all nonessential projects including our Encina demolition project in California. We have also paused face-to-face retail sales activities to support the safety and wellbeing of our team and communities. 
Recognizing that some of our customers have been financially impacted by COVID-19, we temporarily paused all late fees and electric disconnects, and offer deferred payment plans to provide temporary relief. We also work closely with the PUCT, another Texas market participants to create a solution that extends additional assistance through mid-July to low-income customers and those facing significant financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. 
In April, we announced a pledge of $2 million to relief efforts aimed at those on the front lines who needed the most. This includes funding and critical safety supplies to first responders who are in desperate need of personal protective equipment. Community-led relief funds for small businesses, which have been devastated as social distancing and shelter in place, guidelines have forced many to close for months and teachers and educators who play such a pivotal role in our communities where we live and work. We have begun activities to return our employees to the new normal operations, prioritizing their safety and wellbeing. 
Now moving on to our financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 5. We achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, almost a 5% increase from the same period last year. These results were driven by the addition of stream energy and margin enhancement initiatives, partially offset by mild weather across our core markets. 
To put the mild weather into context, ERCOT and the Northeast saw temperatures that were 20% and 17% warmer than the 10-year normal for the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full year guidance based on our expectations of a gradual reopening of our economy during the summer and the stability of our integrated platform. But these are unprecedented times and expect most of the adverse impact from COVID-19 to come from customer payment related items like bad debt. At this point, we estimate that to be around $50 million. We will look at offsetting this impact through prudent cost management and ERCOT's relief fund. 
During the quarter, we implemented our infectious disease and pandemic plan to ensure business continuity as we discussed in the previous slide. 
We also updated our reporting segments during the quarter, and are providing enhanced disclosures, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. These disclosures are intended to help you think about our business in the same way we manage it. I also believe they will help demonstrate the stability of our ERCOT platform that we have long talked about, but which was difficult to illustrate when Retail and Generation went up of as a separate businesses. 
Finally, on the last earnings call in late February, I spoke at length about our sustainability program and our commitment to transparency. To that end, we just published our 10th annual sustainability report. Our comprehensive sustainability framework is foundational to the long-term success of our company. One of the key metrics is the speed at which we are decarbonizing our business. As you will see, we are now 83% of the way to achieving our 2025 goal and have clear line of sight to get there. 
Moving to Slide 6. I want to highlight some of the impacts we are seeing on electric demand in our core markets. 
In the upper right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load for April. As you can see, electric demand has been impacted across the country with declines anywhere between 6% to 9%. Except in ERCOT, which continues to show resilience, and it is down only 2%. Even within ERCOT, we're seeing significant differences between West Texas and the rest of the state driven primarily by the impact of low oil prices in the Permian region. These differences are not only regional but also by customer class, as you can see in the lower right-hand side of the slide. Residential remain, which makes up around 30% of ERCOT peak electric demand this time of the year, is up 7% for the month of paper. While small business and C&I have been negatively impacted. 
The point I want to make here is that the impact to specific companies will depend on the customer mix in their portfolios. In our case, we are heavily weighted towards the Texas residential customer. 
Now looking ahead into the summer. Texas already began a partial reopening of the economy. This suggests that the severe impact to small businesses we have seen in April may ease as the economy reopens. Conversely, the impact on the Oil patch may just be getting started. I will simply remind everyone that our largest exposure in ERCOT is to residential demand, and so far, that has been robust. The impact to summer load is difficult to assess at this point. But I can tell you that summer prices will be dependent on wind production and weather. 
Finally, the long-term outlook for ERCOT from our perspective will remain robust. We know that reserve margins are dependent, almost exclusively on new renewables coming online in the next few years. No doubt, COVID-19 and low oil prices will have an impact on demand. It's difficult to know how much at this point. We have no new renewables PPA this quarter, which is indicative of a slowdown in new renewable development. How much these 2 things offset each other is going to determine scarcity prices going forward. 
Now based on where the forward curve is, not much scarcity is assuming the forward prices, which is not helpful for new renewable developments or any new development for that matter. This is why we think reserve margins will be tighter than what we have seen in the CDR. 
So with this market context, I want to review how we are positioned as a company to perform during this unprecedented period on Slide 7. Since I took over as CEO over 4 years ago, we deliberately evolved our business from a highly endeavored IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. 
During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieve what we view as an investment-grade balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework, and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While the stock price doesn't reflect it, we expect all the good work we have done to be reflected in our stable earnings, as we successfully navigate the current downtime. 
As you can see, we rebalanced our portfolio by selling noncore and underperforming assets to better match Retail Load with Generation. By integrating these 2 complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain, we have significantly stabilized our earnings. 
As you can see in the new segments, our business is heavily weighted towards residential consumers, which has proven to be a more resilient group during this period, particularly in Texas. Second, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Last year, we reached our goal of driving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our target investment-grade metric range of 2.5 to 2.75x, and through continued operational performance, we expect to drive this ratio to the conservative end of that range this year. We remain in close dialogue with the rating agencies, and we continue to target investment-grade ratings over the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet strength goes well beyond these metrics. We have done a good job in managing our maturity schedule and liquidity. Our next maturity is not until 2024. And each year's maturity is sized to be less than any 1 year's free cash flow. Our liquidity also remained strong at approximately $2 billion. 
Next, on capital allocation, all our actions to stabilize and rightsize our business have created tremendous financial flexibility. And now with our deleveraging program behind us, we're focusing all our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our business model and returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we established a longer-term framework built upon a commitment of value creation through disciplined capital allocation across all cycles. With this financial flexibility, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic growth that meets our financial thresholds, and return capital to shareholders through growing our dividend to 7% to 9% combined with programmatic and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, our comprehensive sustainability framework serves as a solid foundation to our portfolio as it is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy, and necessary for our long-term success. 
The bottom line is this, our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We recognize that our business model is unique and relatively new. 
I look forward to further validating the stability of our platform through our strong execution. 
Today, we're taking 1 additional step in the evolution of our business model, and how we report results. We have moved from having 2 distinct businesses, Retail, and Generation to 1 integrated business with a regional focus. Therefore, we need to realign our segment reporting to match our integrated strategy and the way we operate our company. 
Turning to Slide 8. We're introducing the new regional segments and EBITDA sensitivities. These segments will have the benefit of a common market structure, and importantly, we will better highlight the stability of our ERCOT platform. Also, the new sensitivities now captured the full impact of the integrated business at the EBITDA level. The Texas segment will include all activities in our value chain from customer operations to market and plant operations. In this new format, revenues will be primarily driven by Retail, while costs will be either the fuel that we buy for our power plants or the power we purchase from the wholesale market. This is exactly how we manage the business. The integration of these 2 countercyclical businesses results in long-term earnings stability from this segment, which is reinforced by the limited sensitivity to power prices shown in the bottom of the slide. 
The East segment will include all non-Texas customer activity and all Generation assets in the East. This region is not fully balanced between Retail and Generation. Therefore, we will continue to have both revenues and costs for each business. Our focus is to better match these 2 parts so we can fully integrate. 
The West and other segment includes the conventional and renewable projects in California, the Cottonwood lease, and our interest in one international asset. This segment will only have Generation revenue and cost since there is no ability to replicate our integrated model, due to a lack of competitive retail market. Because the East and West segments are not fully integrated, the sensitivity to changes in power prices are not optimized as it is in Texas. We believe this new segment structure better reflects our operations and regional impacts. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2",1218,"Thank you, Mauricio. Starting on Slide 10. I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. 
In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2 distinct lines of business, those being Retail and Generation. Our new segments reflect our integrated regional focus with our customer-facing business as a primary revenue driver and the majority of our Generation and associated costs, particularly in ERCOT, supporting our customer load. Our new segment financial results will provide a clear picture of the EBITDA produced by our integrated segments by geography and is consistent with the way we manage our business, 1 position for each market. 
To help you better understand our historical results in this context, at the top of the slide, we've translated our 2019 results into the new geographical segments as they will be reflected in the components of our guidance going forward. 
Specifically, the Texas segment includes all of our customer market and plant operations within ERCOT and we will be providing the expected contribution from this segment to our consolidated EBITDA guidance range going forward. We will also be providing the expected contribution to EBITDA guidance from the remaining reporting segments, which include East, West, and Corporate, and are comprised of the remainder of our businesses. 
On the upper right of the slide, you will find our 2019 results recast into these categories as compared to the corresponding results of our 2020 EBITDA guidance range. 
Later today, in addition to filing our 10-Q, we will also be filing an 8-K, which will contain restated financials based on our new segments on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 as well as annually for both 2017 and 2018 in order to further assist you in comparative analysis. You will find some of this information on Slide 21 in the appendix to today's presentation as well. 
The bottom half of the slide provides a bit more color on both the operations within each reporting segment as well as some highlights on the key components of the integrated margins within each. Focusing on Texas, you should be thinking of our revenue line as Retail revenue, while our cost to serve is comprised of both fuel costs associated with Generation, supporting our load and purchase power to support load in excess of economic generation. Going forward, Generation revenue in this segment will be minimal. 
In the East, our primary revenue will be from retail sales and capacity. And also include energy revenues from our plants that are not located near our load. The West is exclusively Generation, where our thermal assets in California and associated resource adequacy and energy revenue primarily comprising revenues on the income statement. While cost of goods sold will again primarily reflect fuel costs associated with those assets. 
The West segment also includes our interest in the 2 remaining utility-scale projects in California, those being Agua and Ivanpah, as well as our partial interest in our 1 remaining international generating plant in Australia. However, all 3 of these interests are accounted for under the equity method, and our share of the earnings will be reported on a single line in the income statement. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $349 million in adjusted EBITDA and a robust $167 million in free cash flow before growth for the first quarter of 2020. Texas delivered $195 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $19 million increase versus 2019, largely due to the increase in load from the acquisition of Stream, which occurred in the second half of 2019, and improved margins due to the lower supply costs in Texas. 
The balance of our quarterly results of $154 million from East, West, and Corporate was in line overall with last year's results. However, within this, we did have a few items at note worth highlighting for comparative purposes. 
During 2019, we recognized a onetime gain of $27 million from the settlement of the mid-West Generation asbestos liability. During Q1 of 2020, due to the drop in oil prices, we wrote down our oil inventories in the East by $29 million, which is a noncash charge to earnings and EBITDA. Offsetting this write-down was the recognition in 2020 of $30 million in outage insurance proceeds related to outages that occurred last year. 
Finally, much improved availability of our Sunrise facility in the West and the lower cost of operations allowed our adjusted EBITDA outside of Texas to remain flat versus 2019. 
We saw no material impact from COVID-19 during the first quarter. However, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, over the balance of the year, we currently anticipate an impact of approximately $50 million due to the effects of the pandemic on customer payments, particularly bad debt expense, which we will look to offset through targeted cost management and the ERCOT relief fund. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. During the first quarter of this year, we received the $60 million in cash flow items I highlighted for you last quarter, which contributed to robust free cash flow before growth of $167 million. Due to the Cares Act, we expect our free cash flow before growth [ over ] the balance of the year to further improve from the delay of approximately $17 million of FICA payments into '21 and '22, as well as the acceleration of $11 million of AMT refunds that were previously expected in later years. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure we maintain surplus cash on hand in the event of stress in the banking system, during the quarter, we drew down our revolving credit facility by approximately $550 million to proportionately increase cash on hand. As liquidity in financial markets has improved and we enter the more cash-generative time of the year, we expect to repay the revolver balance back to 0. And since the first quarter, we've already reduced that balance by more than half. 
Finally, turning to an update on share repurchase activity. To date, we have completed $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $33.05, which consists of $60 million in purchases, which was remaining balance of our 2019 program and $164 million of programmatic repurchases under our new capital allocation policy. 
Finally, turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on capital allocation activity. Our expectations for 2020 are unchanged, with the only item of note being the increase in share repurchases year-to-date, having now executed $164 million in share repurchases under the new capital allocation framework through the first 4 months of this year. We have now completed more than 40% of our targeted share repurchases as a part of our commitment to return 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders, which this year totaled $675 million, including our recently increased dividend. 
The balance of $614 million in remaining capital, shown in green on the right of the slide, remains available for accretive investment opportunities. 
However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value enhancing opportunities, we intend to allocate the balance of this unallocated capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Mauricio."

And as Mauricio said, look, the current events provide an opportunity for us to prove the resilience of our platform under extreme positions, and that would provide us a further argument towards that upgrade. I mean that said, understanding in the near term, I think agencies are likely to take more prudent wait and see, if you will, approach to ratings upgrades. So it's reasonable for us to assume that that may extend the timeline a little bit, maybe 6 months forward. Certainly, that's not our objective or target, but I think we had to be reasonable about the pace given the circumstances we're in. But overall, based on our dialogue with the agencies, we're confident that with continued performance, investment-grade remains achievable at our current leverage level, which were in line with those targets."

I mean, I think it is important to recognize that our portfolio in Texas is primarily residential customers. And we have seen actually an increase in demand from those customers. 
Now as you go into the summer, just recognize that perhaps April, the increased demand is much bigger than what you're going to see in the summer months because in the summer months, you normally already have people using a lot of electricity. I mean, people -- kids are out of school, they come back to. So we don't expect to see the same level of impact as we go into this summer as we have seen in April. So yes, and also, it's going to depend on how quickly the economy comes back, right? I mean, small businesses, perhaps they open gradually, they're not going to open a full capacity at first. So we're assessing that. But I think it's too early to tell to start trying to make some sort of assumptions in terms of what would be the ultimate impact of our -- in our portfolio. 
Obviously, if you have a 6% increase or 7% increase on residential demand for the balance of the year, I mean, that's great for us because we have a pretty significant exposure to it if that's what you were trying to imply. But I also want to be cautious that there are so many things that we don't control here. We are, I think we are very well positioned. I think we're managing the -- our company and our risk well.

That fixed price short rolls in overtime, and we can flex and change price on that.

Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to say from everyone at NRG, we sincerely hope that you and your families are well and our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It has never been clear how critical electricity is to our way of life. And now more than ever, our communities are relying on the service that we provide to homes and businesses. I want to thank our essential employees who are on the front lines safely operating our power plants and supporting our customers. These employees continue to impress me every day with their commitment and courage during this unprecedented time. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's call: First, we initiated a comprehensive response to COVID-19, focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our #1 priority remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, so they can safely deliver electricity and keep the lights on for our customers and communities; second, given the changes that we have made to our integrated business, we were able to deliver strong results during the first quarter and reaffirm our full year financial guidance; third, and as we promised on our February earnings call, we are providing enhanced disclosures on our business, including the introduction of new integrated regional segments. 
Turning to Slide 4. I want to talk to you in greater detail about our response to COVID-19. As you know, our top priority has been protecting the safety and wellbeing of our employees. On January 21, 1 day after the first confirmed U.S. case, we activated our Crisis Management Team to ensure we were prepared for any scenario. On March 17, we closed our offices and transition employees to remote work. We have remained fully operational during this time with over 95% of our office personnel working remotely. 
While we closed our offices to nonessential personnel, we also have employees who provide critical or essential services and continue to work at our power plants and in offices every day. As part of our commitment to protecting their health and safety, we introduced health screening guidelines for those continuing to work on-site, initiated deep cleaning protocols, enacted the strict social distancing guidelines, restricted access to offices and power plants, and implemented staggered staffing for essential functions. 
We have also expanded health benefits for all employees to include access to virtual doctors and awarded brands from our NRG employee relief fund. These additional resources are intended to protect our employees and their families. 
With respect to our operations, the impact has been limited. A few outages were delayed due to COVID-19 issues. However, none of them had a material financial impact or reliability implications. Our spring program included 84 outages and a nuclear refueling at STP, so we are well prepared for the summer months. 
We did stop work at all nonessential projects including our Encina demolition project in California. We have also paused face-to-face retail sales activities to support the safety and wellbeing of our team and communities. 
Recognizing that some of our customers have been financially impacted by COVID-19, we temporarily paused all late fees and electric disconnects, and offer deferred payment plans to provide temporary relief. We also work closely with the PUCT, another Texas market participants to create a solution that extends additional assistance through mid-July to low-income customers and those facing significant financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. 
In April, we announced a pledge of $2 million to relief efforts aimed at those on the front lines who needed the most. This includes funding and critical safety supplies to first responders who are in desperate need of personal protective equipment. Community-led relief funds for small businesses, which have been devastated as social distancing and shelter in place, guidelines have forced many to close for months and teachers and educators who play such a pivotal role in our communities where we live and work. We have begun activities to return our employees to the new normal operations, prioritizing their safety and wellbeing. 
Now moving on to our financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 5. We achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, almost a 5% increase from the same period last year. These results were driven by the addition of stream energy and margin enhancement initiatives, partially offset by mild weather across our core markets. 
To put the mild weather into context, ERCOT and the Northeast saw temperatures that were 20% and 17% warmer than the 10-year normal for the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full year guidance based on our expectations of a gradual reopening of our economy during the summer and the stability of our integrated platform. But these are unprecedented times and expect most of the adverse impact from COVID-19 to come from customer payment related items like bad debt. At this point, we estimate that to be around $50 million. We will look at offsetting this impact through prudent cost management and ERCOT's relief fund. 
During the quarter, we implemented our infectious disease and pandemic plan to ensure business continuity as we discussed in the previous slide. 
We also updated our reporting segments during the quarter, and are providing enhanced disclosures, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. These disclosures are intended to help you think about our business in the same way we manage it. I also believe they will help demonstrate the stability of our ERCOT platform that we have long talked about, but which was difficult to illustrate when Retail and Generation went up of as a separate businesses. 
Finally, on the last earnings call in late February, I spoke at length about our sustainability program and our commitment to transparency. To that end, we just published our 10th annual sustainability report. Our comprehensive sustainability framework is foundational to the long-term success of our company. One of the key metrics is the speed at which we are decarbonizing our business. As you will see, we are now 83% of the way to achieving our 2025 goal and have clear line of sight to get there. 
Moving to Slide 6. I want to highlight some of the impacts we are seeing on electric demand in our core markets. 
In the upper right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load for April. As you can see, electric demand has been impacted across the country with declines anywhere between 6% to 9%. Except in ERCOT, which continues to show resilience, and it is down only 2%. Even within ERCOT, we're seeing significant differences between West Texas and the rest of the state driven primarily by the impact of low oil prices in the Permian region. These differences are not only regional but also by customer class, as you can see in the lower right-hand side of the slide. Residential remain, which makes up around 30% of ERCOT peak electric demand this time of the year, is up 7% for the month of paper. While small business and C&I have been negatively impacted. 
The point I want to make here is that the impact to specific companies will depend on the customer mix in their portfolios. In our case, we are heavily weighted towards the Texas residential customer. 
Now looking ahead into the summer. Texas already began a partial reopening of the economy. This suggests that the severe impact to small businesses we have seen in April may ease as the economy reopens. Conversely, the impact on the Oil patch may just be getting started. I will simply remind everyone that our largest exposure in ERCOT is to residential demand, and so far, that has been robust. The impact to summer load is difficult to assess at this point. But I can tell you that summer prices will be dependent on wind production and weather. 
Finally, the long-term outlook for ERCOT from our perspective will remain robust. We know that reserve margins are dependent, almost exclusively on new renewables coming online in the next few years. No doubt, COVID-19 and low oil prices will have an impact on demand. It's difficult to know how much at this point. We have no new renewables PPA this quarter, which is indicative of a slowdown in new renewable development. How much these 2 things offset each other is going to determine scarcity prices going forward. 
Now based on where the forward curve is, not much scarcity is assuming the forward prices, which is not helpful for new renewable developments or any new development for that matter. This is why we think reserve margins will be tighter than what we have seen in the CDR. 
So with this market context, I want to review how we are positioned as a company to perform during this unprecedented period on Slide 7. Since I took over as CEO over 4 years ago, we deliberately evolved our business from a highly endeavored IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. 
During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieve what we view as an investment-grade balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework, and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While the stock price doesn't reflect it, we expect all the good work we have done to be reflected in our stable earnings, as we successfully navigate the current downtime. 
As you can see, we rebalanced our portfolio by selling noncore and underperforming assets to better match Retail Load with Generation. By integrating these 2 complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain, we have significantly stabilized our earnings. 
As you can see in the new segments, our business is heavily weighted towards residential consumers, which has proven to be a more resilient group during this period, particularly in Texas. Second, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Last year, we reached our goal of driving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our target investment-grade metric range of 2.5 to 2.75x, and through continued operational performance, we expect to drive this ratio to the conservative end of that range this year. We remain in close dialogue with the rating agencies, and we continue to target investment-grade ratings over the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet strength goes well beyond these metrics. We have done a good job in managing our maturity schedule and liquidity. Our next maturity is not until 2024. And each year's maturity is sized to be less than any 1 year's free cash flow. Our liquidity also remained strong at approximately $2 billion. 
Next, on capital allocation, all our actions to stabilize and rightsize our business have created tremendous financial flexibility. And now with our deleveraging program behind us, we're focusing all our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our business model and returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we established a longer-term framework built upon a commitment of value creation through disciplined capital allocation across all cycles. With this financial flexibility, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic growth that meets our financial thresholds, and return capital to shareholders through growing our dividend to 7% to 9% combined with programmatic and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, our comprehensive sustainability framework serves as a solid foundation to our portfolio as it is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy, and necessary for our long-term success. 
The bottom line is this, our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We recognize that our business model is unique and relatively new. 
I look forward to further validating the stability of our platform through our strong execution. 
Today, we're taking 1 additional step in the evolution of our business model, and how we report results. We have moved from having 2 distinct businesses, Retail, and Generation to 1 integrated business with a regional focus. Therefore, we need to realign our segment reporting to match our integrated strategy and the way we operate our company. 
Turning to Slide 8. We're introducing the new regional segments and EBITDA sensitivities. These segments will have the benefit of a common market structure, and importantly, we will better highlight the stability of our ERCOT platform. Also, the new sensitivities now captured the full impact of the integrated business at the EBITDA level. The Texas segment will include all activities in our value chain from customer operations to market and plant operations. In this new format, revenues will be primarily driven by Retail, while costs will be either the fuel that we buy for our power plants or the power we purchase from the wholesale market. This is exactly how we manage the business. The integration of these 2 countercyclical businesses results in long-term earnings stability from this segment, which is reinforced by the limited sensitivity to power prices shown in the bottom of the slide. 
The East segment will include all non-Texas customer activity and all Generation assets in the East. This region is not fully balanced between Retail and Generation. Therefore, we will continue to have both revenues and costs for each business. Our focus is to better match these 2 parts so we can fully integrate. 
The West and other segment includes the conventional and renewable projects in California, the Cottonwood lease, and our interest in one international asset. This segment will only have Generation revenue and cost since there is no ability to replicate our integrated model, due to a lack of competitive retail market. Because the East and West segments are not fully integrated, the sensitivity to changes in power prices are not optimized as it is in Texas. We believe this new segment structure better reflects our operations and regional impacts. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2",1218,"Thank you, Mauricio. Starting on Slide 10. I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. 
In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2 distinct lines of business, those being Retail and Generation. Our new segments reflect our integrated regional focus with our customer-facing business as a primary revenue driver and the majority of our Generation and associated costs, particularly in ERCOT, supporting our customer load. Our new segment financial results will provide a clear picture of the EBITDA produced by our integrated segments by geography and is consistent with the way we manage our business, 1 position for each market. 
To help you better understand our historical results in this context, at the top of the slide, we've translated our 2019 results into the new geographical segments as they will be reflected in the components of our guidance going forward. 
Specifically, the Texas segment includes all of our customer market and plant operations within ERCOT and we will be providing the expected contribution from this segment to our consolidated EBITDA guidance range going forward. We will also be providing the expected contribution to EBITDA guidance from the remaining reporting segments, which include East, West, and Corporate, and are comprised of the remainder of our businesses. 
On the upper right of the slide, you will find our 2019 results recast into these categories as compared to the corresponding results of our 2020 EBITDA guidance range. 
Later today, in addition to filing our 10-Q, we will also be filing an 8-K, which will contain restated financials based on our new segments on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 as well as annually for both 2017 and 2018 in order to further assist you in comparative analysis. You will find some of this information on Slide 21 in the appendix to today's presentation as well. 
The bottom half of the slide provides a bit more color on both the operations within each reporting segment as well as some highlights on the key components of the integrated margins within each. Focusing on Texas, you should be thinking of our revenue line as Retail revenue, while our cost to serve is comprised of both fuel costs associated with Generation, supporting our load and purchase power to support load in excess of economic generation. Going forward, Generation revenue in this segment will be minimal. 
In the East, our primary revenue will be from retail sales and capacity. And also include energy revenues from our plants that are not located near our load. The West is exclusively Generation, where our thermal assets in California and associated resource adequacy and energy revenue primarily comprising revenues on the income statement. While cost of goods sold will again primarily reflect fuel costs associated with those assets. 
The West segment also includes our interest in the 2 remaining utility-scale projects in California, those being Agua and Ivanpah, as well as our partial interest in our 1 remaining international generating plant in Australia. However, all 3 of these interests are accounted for under the equity method, and our share of the earnings will be reported on a single line in the income statement. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $349 million in adjusted EBITDA and a robust $167 million in free cash flow before growth for the first quarter of 2020. Texas delivered $195 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $19 million increase versus 2019, largely due to the increase in load from the acquisition of Stream, which occurred in the second half of 2019, and improved margins due to the lower supply costs in Texas. 
The balance of our quarterly results of $154 million from East, West, and Corporate was in line overall with last year's results. However, within this, we did have a few items at note worth highlighting for comparative purposes. 
During 2019, we recognized a onetime gain of $27 million from the settlement of the mid-West Generation asbestos liability. During Q1 of 2020, due to the drop in oil prices, we wrote down our oil inventories in the East by $29 million, which is a noncash charge to earnings and EBITDA. Offsetting this write-down was the recognition in 2020 of $30 million in outage insurance proceeds related to outages that occurred last year. 
Finally, much improved availability of our Sunrise facility in the West and the lower cost of operations allowed our adjusted EBITDA outside of Texas to remain flat versus 2019. 
We saw no material impact from COVID-19 during the first quarter. However, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, over the balance of the year, we currently anticipate an impact of approximately $50 million due to the effects of the pandemic on customer payments, particularly bad debt expense, which we will look to offset through targeted cost management and the ERCOT relief fund. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. During the first quarter of this year, we received the $60 million in cash flow items I highlighted for you last quarter, which contributed to robust free cash flow before growth of $167 million. Due to the Cares Act, we expect our free cash flow before growth [ over ] the balance of the year to further improve from the delay of approximately $17 million of FICA payments into '21 and '22, as well as the acceleration of $11 million of AMT refunds that were previously expected in later years. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure we maintain surplus cash on hand in the event of stress in the banking system, during the quarter, we drew down our revolving credit facility by approximately $550 million to proportionately increase cash on hand. As liquidity in financial markets has improved and we enter the more cash-generative time of the year, we expect to repay the revolver balance back to 0. And since the first quarter, we've already reduced that balance by more than half. 
Finally, turning to an update on share repurchase activity. To date, we have completed $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $33.05, which consists of $60 million in purchases, which was remaining balance of our 2019 program and $164 million of programmatic repurchases under our new capital allocation policy. 
Finally, turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on capital allocation activity. Our expectations for 2020 are unchanged, with the only item of note being the increase in share repurchases year-to-date, having now executed $164 million in share repurchases under the new capital allocation framework through the first 4 months of this year. We have now completed more than 40% of our targeted share repurchases as a part of our commitment to return 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders, which this year totaled $675 million, including our recently increased dividend. 
The balance of $614 million in remaining capital, shown in green on the right of the slide, remains available for accretive investment opportunities. 
However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value enhancing opportunities, we intend to allocate the balance of this unallocated capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Mauricio."

But I would say the fact that both have maintained our positive outlook underscores their appreciation for our performance and our outlook as well as our balance sheet. 
And as Mauricio said, look, the current events provide an opportunity for us to prove the resilience of our platform under extreme positions, and that would provide us a further argument towards that upgrade. I mean that said, understanding in the near term, I think agencies are likely to take more prudent wait and see, if you will, approach to ratings upgrades. So it's reasonable for us to assume that that may extend the timeline a little bit, maybe 6 months forward. Certainly, that's not our objective or target, but I think we had to be reasonable about the pace given the circumstances we're in. But overall, based on our dialogue with the agencies, we're confident that with continued performance, investment-grade remains achievable at our current leverage level, which were in line with those targets."

I mean, people -- kids are out of school, they come back to. So we don't expect to see the same level of impact as we go into this summer as we have seen in April. So yes, and also, it's going to depend on how quickly the economy comes back, right? I mean small businesses, perhaps they open gradually, they're not going to open a full capacity at first. So we're assessing that. But I think it's too early to tell to start trying to make some sort of assumptions in terms of what would be the ultimate impact of our -- in our portfolio. 
Obviously, if you have a 6% increase or 7% increase on residential demand for the balance of the year, I mean, that's great for us because we have a pretty significant exposure to it if that's what you were trying to imply. But I also want to be cautious that there are so many things that we don't control here. We are, I think we are very well positioned. I think we're managing the -- our company and our risk well. But they are also mindful that there is a lot of things that are outside of our control, and we need to just monitor that assessment. And as we see it, we communicate that to you."

So I wouldn't say that we're -- that we are short. In terms of the sensitivities, I mean, now these are integrated sensitivities at the EBITDA level, which not only is the interaction between Generation and Retail on a gross margin basis, but also all this some of the other levels that we have to ensure that we optimize these 2 parts of the business.

We have the opportunity to pass-through price changes. So it's not fixed price and we're short 60 terawatts for the next 5 years, right. That fixed price short rolls in overtime, and we can flex and change price on that.

I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to say from everyone at NRG, we sincerely hope that you and your families are well and our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It has never been clear how critical electricity is to our way of life. And now more than ever, our communities are relying on the service that we provide to homes and businesses. I want to thank our essential employees who are on the front lines safely operating our power plants and supporting our customers. These employees continue to impress me every day with their commitment and courage during this unprecedented time. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's call: First, we initiated a comprehensive response to COVID-19, focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our #1 priority remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, so they can safely deliver electricity and keep the lights on for our customers and communities; second, given the changes that we have made to our integrated business, we were able to deliver strong results during the first quarter and reaffirm our full year financial guidance; third, and as we promised on our February earnings call, we are providing enhanced disclosures on our business, including the introduction of new integrated regional segments. 
Turning to Slide 4. I want to talk to you in greater detail about our response to COVID-19. As you know, our top priority has been protecting the safety and wellbeing of our employees. On January 21, 1 day after the first confirmed U.S. case, we activated our Crisis Management Team to ensure we were prepared for any scenario. On March 17, we closed our offices and transition employees to remote work. We have remained fully operational during this time with over 95% of our office personnel working remotely. 
While we closed our offices to nonessential personnel, we also have employees who provide critical or essential services and continue to work at our power plants and in offices every day. As part of our commitment to protecting their health and safety, we introduced health screening guidelines for those continuing to work on-site, initiated deep cleaning protocols, enacted the strict social distancing guidelines, restricted access to offices and power plants, and implemented staggered staffing for essential functions. 
We have also expanded health benefits for all employees to include access to virtual doctors and awarded brands from our NRG employee relief fund. These additional resources are intended to protect our employees and their families. 
With respect to our operations, the impact has been limited. A few outages were delayed due to COVID-19 issues. However, none of them had a material financial impact or reliability implications. Our spring program included 84 outages and a nuclear refueling at STP, so we are well prepared for the summer months. 
We did stop work at all nonessential projects including our Encina demolition project in California. We have also paused face-to-face retail sales activities to support the safety and wellbeing of our team and communities. 
Recognizing that some of our customers have been financially impacted by COVID-19, we temporarily paused all late fees and electric disconnects, and offer deferred payment plans to provide temporary relief. We also work closely with the PUCT, another Texas market participants to create a solution that extends additional assistance through mid-July to low-income customers and those facing significant financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. 
In April, we announced a pledge of $2 million to relief efforts aimed at those on the front lines who needed the most. This includes funding and critical safety supplies to first responders who are in desperate need of personal protective equipment. Community-led relief funds for small businesses, which have been devastated as social distancing and shelter in place, guidelines have forced many to close for months and teachers and educators who play such a pivotal role in our communities where we live and work. We have begun activities to return our employees to the new normal operations, prioritizing their safety and wellbeing. 
Now moving on to our financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 5. We achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, almost a 5% increase from the same period last year. These results were driven by the addition of stream energy and margin enhancement initiatives, partially offset by mild weather across our core markets. 
To put the mild weather into context, ERCOT and the Northeast saw temperatures that were 20% and 17% warmer than the 10-year normal for the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full year guidance based on our expectations of a gradual reopening of our economy during the summer and the stability of our integrated platform. But these are unprecedented times and expect most of the adverse impact from COVID-19 to come from customer payment related items like bad debt. At this point, we estimate that to be around $50 million. We will look at offsetting this impact through prudent cost management and ERCOT's relief fund. 
During the quarter, we implemented our infectious disease and pandemic plan to ensure business continuity as we discussed in the previous slide. 
We also updated our reporting segments during the quarter, and are providing enhanced disclosures, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. These disclosures are intended to help you think about our business in the same way we manage it. I also believe they will help demonstrate the stability of our ERCOT platform that we have long talked about, but which was difficult to illustrate when Retail and Generation went up of as a separate businesses. 
Finally, on the last earnings call in late February, I spoke at length about our sustainability program and our commitment to transparency. To that end, we just published our 10th annual sustainability report. Our comprehensive sustainability framework is foundational to the long-term success of our company. One of the key metrics is the speed at which we are decarbonizing our business. As you will see, we are now 83% of the way to achieving our 2025 goal and have clear line of sight to get there. 
Moving to Slide 6. I want to highlight some of the impacts we are seeing on electric demand in our core markets. 
In the upper right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load for April. As you can see, electric demand has been impacted across the country with declines anywhere between 6% to 9%. Except in ERCOT, which continues to show resilience, and it is down only 2%. Even within ERCOT, we're seeing significant differences between West Texas and the rest of the state driven primarily by the impact of low oil prices in the Permian region. These differences are not only regional but also by customer class, as you can see in the lower right-hand side of the slide. Residential remain, which makes up around 30% of ERCOT peak electric demand this time of the year, is up 7% for the month of paper. While small business and C&I have been negatively impacted. 
The point I want to make here is that the impact to specific companies will depend on the customer mix in their portfolios. In our case, we are heavily weighted towards the Texas residential customer. 
Now looking ahead into the summer. Texas already began a partial reopening of the economy. This suggests that the severe impact to small businesses we have seen in April may ease as the economy reopens. Conversely, the impact on the Oil patch may just be getting started. I will simply remind everyone that our largest exposure in ERCOT is to residential demand, and so far, that has been robust. The impact to summer load is difficult to assess at this point. But I can tell you that summer prices will be dependent on wind production and weather. 
Finally, the long-term outlook for ERCOT from our perspective will remain robust. We know that reserve margins are dependent, almost exclusively on new renewables coming online in the next few years. No doubt, COVID-19 and low oil prices will have an impact on demand. It's difficult to know how much at this point. We have no new renewables PPA this quarter, which is indicative of a slowdown in new renewable development. How much these 2 things offset each other is going to determine scarcity prices going forward. 
Now based on where the forward curve is, not much scarcity is assuming the forward prices, which is not helpful for new renewable developments or any new development for that matter. This is why we think reserve margins will be tighter than what we have seen in the CDR. 
So with this market context, I want to review how we are positioned as a company to perform during this unprecedented period on Slide 7. Since I took over as CEO over 4 years ago, we deliberately evolved our business from a highly endeavored IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. 
During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieve what we view as an investment-grade balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework, and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While the stock price doesn't reflect it, we expect all the good work we have done to be reflected in our stable earnings, as we successfully navigate the current downtime. 
As you can see, we rebalanced our portfolio by selling noncore and underperforming assets to better match Retail Load with Generation. By integrating these 2 complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain, we have significantly stabilized our earnings. 
As you can see in the new segments, our business is heavily weighted towards residential consumers, which has proven to be a more resilient group during this period, particularly in Texas. Second, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Last year, we reached our goal of driving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our target investment-grade metric range of 2.5 to 2.75x, and through continued operational performance, we expect to drive this ratio to the conservative end of that range this year. We remain in close dialogue with the rating agencies, and we continue to target investment-grade ratings over the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet strength goes well beyond these metrics. We have done a good job in managing our maturity schedule and liquidity. Our next maturity is not until 2024. And each year's maturity is sized to be less than any 1 year's free cash flow. Our liquidity also remained strong at approximately $2 billion. 
Next, on capital allocation, all our actions to stabilize and rightsize our business have created tremendous financial flexibility. And now with our deleveraging program behind us, we're focusing all our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our business model and returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we established a longer-term framework built upon a commitment of value creation through disciplined capital allocation across all cycles. With this financial flexibility, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic growth that meets our financial thresholds, and return capital to shareholders through growing our dividend to 7% to 9% combined with programmatic and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, our comprehensive sustainability framework serves as a solid foundation to our portfolio as it is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy, and necessary for our long-term success. 
The bottom line is this, our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We recognize that our business model is unique and relatively new. 
I look forward to further validating the stability of our platform through our strong execution. 
Today, we're taking 1 additional step in the evolution of our business model, and how we report results. We have moved from having 2 distinct businesses, Retail, and Generation to 1 integrated business with a regional focus. Therefore, we need to realign our segment reporting to match our integrated strategy and the way we operate our company. 
Turning to Slide 8. We're introducing the new regional segments and EBITDA sensitivities. These segments will have the benefit of a common market structure, and importantly, we will better highlight the stability of our ERCOT platform. Also, the new sensitivities now captured the full impact of the integrated business at the EBITDA level. The Texas segment will include all activities in our value chain from customer operations to market and plant operations. In this new format, revenues will be primarily driven by Retail, while costs will be either the fuel that we buy for our power plants or the power we purchase from the wholesale market. This is exactly how we manage the business. The integration of these 2 countercyclical businesses results in long-term earnings stability from this segment, which is reinforced by the limited sensitivity to power prices shown in the bottom of the slide. 
The East segment will include all non-Texas customer activity and all Generation assets in the East. This region is not fully balanced between Retail and Generation. Therefore, we will continue to have both revenues and costs for each business. Our focus is to better match these 2 parts so we can fully integrate. 
The West and other segment includes the conventional and renewable projects in California, the Cottonwood lease, and our interest in one international asset. This segment will only have Generation revenue and cost since there is no ability to replicate our integrated model, due to a lack of competitive retail market. Because the East and West segments are not fully integrated, the sensitivity to changes in power prices are not optimized as it is in Texas. We believe this new segment structure better reflects our operations and regional impacts. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed.

I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. 
In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2 distinct lines of business, those being Retail and Generation. Our new segments reflect our integrated regional focus with our customer-facing business as a primary revenue driver and the majority of our Generation and associated costs, particularly in ERCOT, supporting our customer load. Our new segment financial results will provide a clear picture of the EBITDA produced by our integrated segments by geography and is consistent with the way we manage our business, 1 position for each market. 
To help you better understand our historical results in this context, at the top of the slide, we've translated our 2019 results into the new geographical segments as they will be reflected in the components of our guidance going forward. 
Specifically, the Texas segment includes all of our customer market and plant operations within ERCOT and we will be providing the expected contribution from this segment to our consolidated EBITDA guidance range going forward. We will also be providing the expected contribution to EBITDA guidance from the remaining reporting segments, which include East, West, and Corporate, and are comprised of the remainder of our businesses. 
On the upper right of the slide, you will find our 2019 results recast into these categories as compared to the corresponding results of our 2020 EBITDA guidance range. 
Later today, in addition to filing our 10-Q, we will also be filing an 8-K, which will contain restated financials based on our new segments on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 as well as annually for both 2017 and 2018 in order to further assist you in comparative analysis. You will find some of this information on Slide 21 in the appendix to today's presentation as well. 
The bottom half of the slide provides a bit more color on both the operations within each reporting segment as well as some highlights on the key components of the integrated margins within each. Focusing on Texas, you should be thinking of our revenue line as Retail revenue, while our cost to serve is comprised of both fuel costs associated with Generation, supporting our load and purchase power to support load in excess of economic generation. Going forward, Generation revenue in this segment will be minimal. 
In the East, our primary revenue will be from retail sales and capacity. And also include energy revenues from our plants that are not located near our load. The West is exclusively Generation, where our thermal assets in California and associated resource adequacy and energy revenue primarily comprising revenues on the income statement. While cost of goods sold will again primarily reflect fuel costs associated with those assets. 
The West segment also includes our interest in the 2 remaining utility-scale projects in California, those being Agua and Ivanpah, as well as our partial interest in our 1 remaining international generating plant in Australia. However, all 3 of these interests are accounted for under the equity method, and our share of the earnings will be reported on a single line in the income statement. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $349 million in adjusted EBITDA and a robust $167 million in free cash flow before growth for the first quarter of 2020. Texas delivered $195 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $19 million increase versus 2019, largely due to the increase in load from the acquisition of Stream, which occurred in the second half of 2019, and improved margins due to the lower supply costs in Texas. 
The balance of our quarterly results of $154 million from East, West, and Corporate was in line overall with last year's results. However, within this, we did have a few items at note worth highlighting for comparative purposes. 
During 2019, we recognized a onetime gain of $27 million from the settlement of the mid-West Generation asbestos liability. During Q1 of 2020, due to the drop in oil prices, we wrote down our oil inventories in the East by $29 million, which is a noncash charge to earnings and EBITDA. Offsetting this write-down was the recognition in 2020 of $30 million in outage insurance proceeds related to outages that occurred last year. 
Finally, much improved availability of our Sunrise facility in the West and the lower cost of operations allowed our adjusted EBITDA outside of Texas to remain flat versus 2019. 
We saw no material impact from COVID-19 during the first quarter. However, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, over the balance of the year, we currently anticipate an impact of approximately $50 million due to the effects of the pandemic on customer payments, particularly bad debt expense, which we will look to offset through targeted cost management and the ERCOT relief fund. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. During the first quarter of this year, we received the $60 million in cash flow items I highlighted for you last quarter, which contributed to robust free cash flow before growth of $167 million. Due to the Cares Act, we expect our free cash flow before growth [ over ] the balance of the year to further improve from the delay of approximately $17 million of FICA payments into '21 and '22, as well as the acceleration of $11 million of AMT refunds that were previously expected in later years. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure we maintain surplus cash on hand in the event of stress in the banking system, during the quarter, we drew down our revolving credit facility by approximately $550 million to proportionately increase cash on hand. As liquidity in financial markets has improved and we enter the more cash-generative time of the year, we expect to repay the revolver balance back to 0. And since the first quarter, we've already reduced that balance by more than half. 
Finally, turning to an update on share repurchase activity. To date, we have completed $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $33.05, which consists of $60 million in purchases, which was remaining balance of our 2019 program and $164 million of programmatic repurchases under our new capital allocation policy. 
Finally, turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on capital allocation activity. Our expectations for 2020 are unchanged, with the only item of note being the increase in share repurchases year-to-date, having now executed $164 million in share repurchases under the new capital allocation framework through the first 4 months of this year. We have now completed more than 40% of our targeted share repurchases as a part of our commitment to return 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders, which this year totaled $675 million, including our recently increased dividend. 
The balance of $614 million in remaining capital, shown in green on the right of the slide, remains available for accretive investment opportunities.

And as Mauricio said, look, the current events provide an opportunity for us to prove the resilience of our platform under extreme positions, and that would provide us a further argument towards that upgrade. I mean that said, understanding in the near term, I think agencies are likely to take more prudent wait and see, if you will, approach to ratings upgrades.

Certainly, that's not our objective or target, but I think we had to be reasonable about the pace given the circumstances we're in.

Now as you go into the summer, just recognize that perhaps April, the increased demand is much bigger than what you're going to see in the summer months because in the summer months, you normally already have people using a lot of electricity. I mean, people -- kids are out of school, they come back to. So we don't expect to see the same level of impact as we go into this summer as we have seen in April. So yes, and also, it's going to depend on how quickly the economy comes back, right? I mean small businesses, perhaps they open gradually, they're not going to open a full capacity at first. So we're assessing that. But I think it's too early to tell to start trying to make some sort of assumptions in terms of what would be the ultimate impact of our -- in our portfolio.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of operations. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the men and women of NRG who have been reporting to work during this pandemic at our power plants and customer care centers.
On behalf of everyone, thank you for keeping the lights on during this difficult time. Today, I'm pleased to share several important business updates as highlighted on Slide 3.
First, we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire Direct Energy, a highly complementary North American home and business retail company that advances our customer-focused strategy and strengthens our integrated platform.
This is a compelling transaction that will greatly expand our retail footprint across North America and further diversify our product offerings and earnings.
Second, this transaction will create significant shareholder value. It exceeds our stated investment hurdle rates and strengthens our path to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. And finally, our integrated platform continues to deliver solid results.
We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance and initiating 2021 guidance in line with expectations.
I'd like to go right into a summary of the Direct Energy acquisition on Slide 5. This is the right transaction at the right time, and it represents a considerable opportunity for our business. Perfecting our integrated model means moving closer to the customer and rebalancing our retail generation portfolio.
These transactions does exactly that. It greatly expands and enhances our retail business by adding over 3 million electric natural gas and service retail customers throughout the United States and Canada.
It strengthens our core operating platform by creating a more balanced generation retail portfolio, particularly in the Northeast, where we can expand the capital-light renewable PPA strategy we have deployed in ERCOT.
It as a proven and well-established retail gas platform with national recognition and reach, it reduces our earnings mix from coal and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term emission reduction targets. 
And it creates significant value by leveraging our scalable operational platform. We expect to realize $300 million of cost synergies per year. This transaction is highly attractive and accretive. It exceeds our stated investment criteria, represents a multiple of 4.9x EBIT to EBITDA after synergies and a 28% free cash flow yield on our invested capital. 
Importantly, we will achieve our targeted credit metrics within 12 months of closing. The purchase price of $3.625 billion will be funded through a mix of debt, equity-linked securities and cash on hand. 
Kirk will provide more detail around these and what it means for our capital allocation plan and financials in 2020 and '21. The approvals required to close this transaction includes HSR, FERC and the Canada Competition Act. Additionally, Centrica will hold a shareholder vote on the transaction within the next month.
We target closing by the end of 2020. Turning to Slide 6. I want to briefly talk about how this transaction fits within our overall strategic road map.
Since I became CEO 4.5 years ago, we have transformed our business from a highly levered IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company.
During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.
Our overarching commitment was to make sure you knew who we were and where we were heading with no head scratches. Along these lines, at our 2018 Analyst Day, we presented a strategic road map, which you can see on this slide.
With 2020, marking the final year of our 3-year 3-part transformation plan, we have now fully turned our attention to our next phase of redefining NRG and moving closer to the customer.
Growing our retail businesses positions the company to benefit from current market trends and better integrates complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain to further stabilize earnings, improve the quality of cash flows and lower our overall business risk profile.
Today's announcement is consistent with our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure while maintaining financial discipline.
It is just another step we're taking that demonstrates our commitment to creating a best-in-class customer-focused integrated energy organization.
The acquisition of Direct Energy is highly complementary to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. When complete, NRG will have the strongest collection of competitive power brands offering energy products and services in North America.
NRG brands, including Reliance and Green Mountain, have been focused primarily on electricity customers with the highest concentration in Texas. 
The Direct Energy brands, including air to significantly expands our mass and C&I footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas.
This portfolio not only enhances our current offerings, but it also adds complementary business such as natural gas. Direct Energy operates one of the largest natural gas retail platforms in the country, which we see as a logical extension of our current product offerings.
We have been impressed with the strong track record of Direct retail's gas business and expect they will benefit from operating on our platform, and under our risk management program. The combined portfolio will continue to be heavily weighted towards the residential customer, allowing us the opportunity to provide an unparalleled level of innovation across products and services.
Both residential and business customers will be able to leverage our scope and design energy plants to fit their specific needs, taking consumer choice to a whole new level.
And as we have seen time and time again, empowering customers with choice is both good for them and good for our business.
Before we move to the next slide, I want to briefly address the impact of COVID-19 on these consumer-facing platforms. Regarding energy specifically, I have been impressed by the quick turn to digital selling when face-to-face marketing was paused due to state restrictions.
The adaptability of the team to quickly evolve without missing a bit and deliver is a job well done. For Direct Energy, I will limit my commentary as we have not completed the acquisition.
But I will say that we are comfortable with what we have seen and have taken the near-term impact of COVID-19 into our plans and expectations.
Now turning to Slide 8. This transaction provides a unique opportunity to achieve significant cost synergies, which we expect to total $300 million per year.
These significant savings are possible by leveraging our integrated model and disciplined cost management that we have applied since 2016 and throughout our transformation plan. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, we expect to leverage our consolidated platform and processes, preserve the value-added talent and capabilities from the acquisition and focus our talent on optimizing the combined model.
Onetime costs to achieve will be $220 million, primarily for systems, process and personnel consolidation costs. Our proven model of integration results in a streamlined operating model that provides cost competitive products and places the customer at the center of everything we do.
Now turning to Slide 9, which provides the 3 pro forma run rate metrics. As you can see, this transaction creates tremendous shareholder value while maintaining significant financial flexibility, with $6 billion in excess cash generated through 2025, after achieving our target investment-grade metrics and growing our dividend at the midpoint of our 7% to 9% annual target. 
On one final note, before I move to our quarterly business update, I would like to take a moment to say to the Direct Energy team. We look forward to welcoming you to the NRG family. 
Moving to Slide 11. I want to provide you with a preview of our year-to-date results and other business updates. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we delivered $574 million of adjusted EBITDA, 22% higher than the same period last year.
The performance during the quarter was primarily driven by favorable weather, strong mass retail load as a result of stay-at-home restrictions and lower sales and marketing costs due to timing. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand at $922 million, a 15% increase from last year.
And as a result of our strong performance over the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges.
We expect to pull the full earnings material and thank you on August 6. And given today's comprehensive strategy and capital allocation update, do not currently expect to host a call. 
Now moving to the right side of the slide. While we typically wait until the third quarter to initiate next year's guidance, in light of today's acquisition announcement, we're initiating 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion adjusted EBITDA and 2.27 -- $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion of free cash flow before growth. These guidance ranges further demonstrate our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions.
Moving to the bottom right portion of the slide, we're also announcing 3 strategic portfolio updates today. First, we are opportunistically buying out the Midwest generation leases. As a reminder, these assets were acquired in 2014 as part of the Edison mission transaction, and the leases have been in place since 2000. Consistent with our efforts to simplify our balance sheet and achieve investment-grade credit rating, we have successfully negotiated to buy out the leases. 
This action creates greater operational and financial flexibility with the assets. We expect the net cash cost to be $112 million. Next, we expect to monetize Agua Caliente, which was previously delayed by the PG&E bankruptcy. We expect net proceeds from this asset to total $120 million.
And finally, as we roll forward to 2021 capital allocation, we will be completing the Encina site improvement project, which began this year. We're allocating $25 million in 2021.
And following completion, we expect to monetize the site at a return significantly exceeding our hurdle rates. So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial update."

I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the direct acquisition. Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-dat",2039,"Thank you, Mauricio. I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the direct acquisition. 
Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-date results and outlook over the balance of the year, which to be clear, includes lower expected COVID-related costs versus our last update, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for EBITDA and free cash flow for growth. Mauricio also mentioned, we've executed an agreement with the owner lessors of Powerton and Joliet to purchase those assets, thereby eliminating the lease obligations we assumed as a part of their acquisition.
As a lessor, we have kept those assets in compliance with environmental regulations through back end control investments and in the case of Joliette, by converting units from coal to natural gas. By purchasing these assets, we're able to eliminate the lease obligations, which are treated as debt for ratings purposes, thereby streamlining our balance sheet.
Moreover, as owners rather than lessors, we have a greater operational and strategic flexibility, thus providing us a greater range of alternatives to optimize their benefits to NRG going forward.
The purchase of these assets will be funded with approximately $112 million of NRG capital. With the balance of the buy in, funded with debt, replacing the $148 million lease obligation on a credit neutral basis.
Turning to Slide 14. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation, which includes 2 notable changes. First, our investments increased primarily as a result of the Midwest Gen purchase.
And second, we're reserving the remaining balance of 2020 capital of $664 million in order to help fund the direct acquisition, which we expect to close by early '21. We recognize that this results in a partial decrease of the capital previously earmarked for share repurchases under our 50-50 allocation policy. However, as I'll demonstrate shortly, we are confident that this is a superior use of this capital versus repurchasing our own stock.
Turning to the direct acquisition and starting with sources and uses on Slide 15, the purchase price of Direct plus expected transaction costs and expenses, leads us to total uses of $3.775 billion.
As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect to fund this with the following sources of capital. 
First, while we fully backstopped a bridge facility to fund the acquisition, our plan is to issue new secured and unsecured notes, likely prior to closing to raise approximately $2.4 billion towards the acquisition.
However, we view approximately $1.05 billion of this acquisition leverage to be temporary as we intend to delever by this amount using 2021 capital in order to rapidly return to our investment-grade metrics within the first year.
We view this as a capital allocation priority. And based on extensive discussions with the rating agencies who understand and appreciate this commitment, we expect favorable reports on NRG and the transaction in the very near future. With this anticipated support from the agencies and our confidence in returning to our target metrics, we expect this will put us on track to potentially earn an investment-grade rating by late next year or early '22, given the risk reducing impact of the transaction on our overall platform. 
We have also reserved approximately $750 million in potential market sourced equity which is a base case, we are showing as equity-linked or convertible securities.
This was a critical component of our rating strategy, and we will be focused on optimizing the structure and magnitude of this portion of the capital sources for the acquisition. We will look to balance equity treatment, ratings impact and overall cost of capital and will select the ideal structure based on market conditions as we move closer to closing the transaction.
Finally, we will fund the balance of the purchase price with the 2020 excess capital I reviewed earlier.
Additionally, as noted on the slide, we'll be increasing our liquidity facilities in connection with the transaction as well, with a total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities supplemented by excess capacity on our existing revolver, all of which is primarily intended to fund letters of credit in connection with hedging activities.
Our analysis and long track record of efficient collateral management gives us high confidence in our ability to leverage these strengths to significantly reduce these requirements as we integrate Direct.
This opportunity will be further enhanced as we move to investment-grade as we expect at least $1.5 billion in reduced collateral needs, from an investment-grade ratings upgrade alone.
Finally, in order to ensure nimble access to cash and liquidity, we are increasing our minimum cash, which we deduct before calculating capital available for allocation by $150 million from $500 million currently to $650 million following the transaction. 
Turning next to Slide 16. I'll begin our review of the financial benefits of the direct acquisition with an overview of the 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance Mauricio provided, which will provide a baseline for the acquisition impact.
We're initiating 2021 guidance of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and 1.7 -- $1.275 billion rather, and $1.475 billion in free cash flow before growth.
Our stand-alone guidance is consistent with 2020 expected results despite the backwardated power price curves, further underscoring the resilience of our integrated model. Although we expect to close the Direct acquisition by early 2021, we expect to realize the full run rate impact of the transaction by '23 due to the ramp-up in significant synergy benefits as well as the decreasing incremental interest costs associated with the transaction as we quickly repay a portion of the acquisition debt in '21 in order to return to our investment-grade credit metrics in the first year of the transaction.
Given our strong confidence in the ongoing resilience of our integrated model, we'll use the midpoint of NRG's 2021 guidance to show the full run rate financial power of the combination, which we'll realize by '23. 
Starting with 2021. Based on the assumption of a January 1 close, we expect direct energy to contribute an incremental $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. This consists of 3 components: first, baseline or run rate EBITDA before synergies of $440 million.
Second, we expect nearly half of the full amount of synergies of approximately $135 million in the first year of the acquisition. And finally, having assessed and risk-adjusted our expectations for Direct's 2021 financial results to allow for the possible impact of various COVID-19 outcomes, we've made a downward adjustment to the '21 expected EBITDA of approximately $75 million.
We view these assumptions as potentially conservative as should this possible impact abate or moderate, we may see upside to the 2021 contribution from Direct.
As we increase to the full impact of synergies over the next 2 years, we expect direct to contribute a total of $740 million in adjusted EBITDA or just under 5x adjusted EBITDA based on the purchase price, leading to $2.74 billion in total pro forma adjusted run rate EBITDA in 2023.
Turning to free cash flow before growth. In 2021, we expect direct to contribute $240 million in incremental cash flow after deducting incremental acquisition debt interest of approximately $150 million, dividends on the new convertible preferred and other cash flow items.
As we will be repaying approximately $1.05 billion of debt in 2021 in order to return to our target credit metrics in the first year, we will realize approximately $50 million in lower interest from the acquisition going forward. We will, however, likely reduce or realized rather this reduction in interest by repaying higher coupon legacy NRG unsecured notes, which will become callable next year, helping us optimize interest savings from delevering.
These savings, combined with the full impact of synergies, drive run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from the acquisition to $540 million by 2023.
As shown in the lower left of the slide, after giving effect for NRG capital allocated to the transaction, which totals approximately $1.94 billion, the run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from Direct implies a 28% free cash flow yield as compared to an approximate 17% yield on NRG shares at the current price, Helping to underscore not only the compelling financial impact of the transaction on an absolute basis, but more importantly, relative to repurchasing our own stock with this excess capital as well.
Moreover, as we recognize, we must fully consider the financial impact of allocating capital to this transaction on a relative basis. 
To further illustrate this on the lower right corner of the slide, we've compared the free cash flow per share impact of repurchasing shares with the capital allocated toward Direct, using share prices ranging from the current level in the mid-30s to $42 a share, which is the 52-week high. As you can see, this implies a run rate impact of the direct acquisition of approximately 8% to 13% accretion to free cash flow per share, importantly, on this relative basis.
Finally, by acquiring Direct, we are also able to use our substantial surplus of net operating losses to shield incremental cash taxes over most of the remaining decades, thereby accelerating their use and driving additional positive after-tax NPV of approximately $100 million versus the longer time frame over, which we would have used them on a stand-alone basis. 
However, despite this accelerated use of NRG's NOLS, we do not expect to become a full cash taxpayer on a combined basis until late in this decade, providing ongoing substantial tax runway even when combined. 
Turning to 21 capital allocation on Slide 17. Starting with the midpoint of 2021 free cash flow before growth, which I reviewed earlier, we expect to supplement this excess capital through the planned sale of our remaining interest in Agua Caliente in early 2021, thereby augmenting capital available for allocation by an expected net $120 million and leading to $1.72 billion in excess cash before deducting the increase of minimum cash of $150 million.
This deduction leaves us at $1.57 billion in incremental 2021 capital available for allocation, which will be first allocated to reducing debt in order to return balance sheet metrics to our target levels.
As I mentioned previously, as opposed to repaying lower cost debt, we'll issue the fund direct will augment the interest savings power by most likely targeting that higher coupon legacy unsecured debt, which is callable in 2021.
We then reserved $317 million for dividends based on the midpoint of our targeted dividend growth rate range of 7% to 9%. Finally, we have approximately $200 million in identified investments, primarily consisting of cost to achieve in connection with generating synergies from the direct acquisition, leaving us then fully allocated for 2021. 
Following our return to investment-grade metrics in 2021, we plan to resume our policy of returning 50% of excess capital to shareholders with the remaining balance reserve for additional growth opportunities but remain flexible in increasing capital return to shareholders should superior investment opportunities not materialize. 
Finally, turning to our credit profile on Slide 17 and our continuing focus on maintaining our credit ratio and remaining on track to achieve investment grade.
As shown on the table for 2021, on a stand-alone basis, we would be at the more favorable end of our targeted range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to corporate EBITDA.
When we then have the impact of this transaction, or approximately $1.5 billion of incremental debt, which is net of almost $1.1 billion in deleveraging in '21 and $500 million of incremental EBITDA which was -- does not yet reflect the entire expected run rate synergies, our forecasted net debt to corporate EBITDA at the end of 2021 on a combined basis, will be close to the midpoint of our targeted range, remaining within our targeted credit metrics by the end of 2021 underscores our commitment to continuing on a path to achieving investment-grade in the near future, which we now expect would be possible at the end of 2021 or early '22, based on our continuing dialogue with the rating agencies about the strength of our integrated platform and this business risk reducing transaction.
Mauricio, I'll turn it back to you."

I mean before moving to closing remarks, I want to review our capital allocation road map on Slide 20. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It was built upon our long-term commitment of value creation.
As you can see in the bar chart on the left, we have been disciplined in deploying every dollar of our excess capital and adhering to our capital allocation principles. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly 5 years ago was to first leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and we have done that.
Next, it was to use our tremendous financial flexibility to deploy our excess cash in good sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy.
If this was not an option, we would return capital back to shareholders. And we did, resulting in a nearly 25% reduction in our share count. Today's investment is consistent with our strategy and exceeds all financial hurdle rates.
We're using our financial flexibility to fund the project and expect to complete the deleveraging program in 2021. Then we would return to our target 50% growth and 50% return of capital objective in 2022.
Our dividend policy remains unchanged at 7% to 9% annual growth. This is a great transaction for NRG and will be a source of value creation for all our stakeholders in the years to come.
In closing, on Slide 21, I believe today's business update is another example of how everyone here at NRG remains focused on creating sustainable long-term value. This transaction is the right transaction. 
It expands our geographic reach and product offerings. It diversifies our business and reduces financial risks. It provides opportunities for significant synergies, enhancing our cost competitiveness and unlocking further value for our customers.
It improves our path to investment-grade and resilience once achieved. It enhances opportunities for organic growth and our ability to thrive through an increasingly cleaner and electrified economy.
And it will create significant and sustainable shareholder value. Thank you for your time today, and I also look forward to providing all our stakeholders more information during our Analyst Day in early 2021. Catherine, with that, we're ready to take questions."

That's why first focus for me on the financial analysis was ensuring that we had a transaction that measured up relative to our own stock.
And given the priority to deleveraging and what we believe is a superior long-term sustainable impact on shareholder value, and that's getting to that investment-grade rating.
We are temporarily but very dedicated to prioritizing that deleveraging capital I mentioned before.
But importantly, I also underscore as I think Mauricio did, once we get through that period of time, we expect to return. And remembering that we're continuing to deliver capital back to our shareholders through our more robust and growing dividend. But beyond '21, once we get back to those ratios, and we will, we have an opportunity to go back to our 50-50 plan, supplementing the dividend and buybacks."

But it doesn't mean that we have to own every single asset. We can own the asset. We can rent it, and then we can also lean on the bilateral wholesale market.
So we have that optionality, and we're going to do what we believe is the most cost-efficient and profit maximizing way of doing it. So I feel very, very comfortable that now that we have this platform, we're going to be able to optimize it like we have optimized ERCO. 
Your second question was about the makeup of the businesses. What I can tell you today is I'm really, really excited about the platform that we're acquiring today.
And this is no different than what we do at NRG. We're constantly evaluating and optimizing our portfolio. And once the direct energy is part of energy, we're going to do the same thing with the same rigor.

If you begin the additive effect of that ongoing cash flow is buoyed by our now more resilient and diversified platform on a robust basis. I think it doesn't take very many years because you -- even after you deduct for the dividend, you can add those numbers up on flexibility of cash flow. And within a couple of 3 years, you start to get something close to the current market cap of the company.
Again, not to say we intend to do that, but I'm just illustrating what that means by the order of magnitude over a relatively short period of time after we get past this deleveraging period."

I mean, we want to move closer to the customer, we believe that the megatrends that we're seeing support that move on the energy value chain. And if you think about what this transaction does for us, it doubles the size of our retail mass business. It balances our generation and retail portfolio in the East.
It adds a very well-respected national gas retail platform, it expands our product offering beyond just electricity and natural gas and other services that allows us to reduce the acquisition cost and increases the stickiness with customers. 
And across our C&I business, at a time when you're seeing more onshoring of manufacturing in the United States, given the supply chain environment or more hostile environment in the world.
And we are achieving all of that at a very attractive multiple of 4.9x, exceeding our investment hurdle rates, achieving a free cash flow yield on the capital of almost 30%.
And all of that, we will get back to our targeted credit metrics within 12 months.

On behalf of everyone, thank you for keeping the lights on during this difficult time. Today, I'm pleased to share several important business updates as highlighted on Slide 3.
First, we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire Direct Energy, a highly complementary North American home and business retail company that advances our customer-focused strategy and strengthens our integrated platform. This is a compelling transaction that will greatly expand our retail footprint across North America and further diversify our product offerings and earnings.
Second, this transaction will create significant shareholder value. It exceeds our stated investment hurdle rates and strengthens our path to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. And finally, our integrated platform continues to deliver solid results. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance and initiating 2021 guidance in line with expectations.
I'd like to go right into a summary of the Direct Energy acquisition on Slide 5. This is the right transaction at the right time, and it represents a considerable opportunity for our business. Perfecting our integrated model means moving closer to the customer and rebalancing our retail generation portfolio.
These transactions does exactly that. It greatly expands and enhances our retail business by adding over 3 million electric, natural gas and service retail customers throughout the United States and Canada. It strengthens our core operating platform by creating a more balanced generation retail portfolio, particularly in the Northeast, where we can expand the capital-light renewable PPA strategy we have deployed in ERCOT. It adds a proven and well-established retail gas platform with national recognition and reach. It reduces our earnings mix from coal and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term emission reduction targets. And it creates significant value by leveraging our scalable operational platform. We expect to realize $300 million of cost synergies per year. This transaction is highly attractive and accretive. It exceeds our stated investment criteria, represents a multiple of 4.9x EBIT to EBITDA after synergies and a 28% free cash flow yield on our invested capital. 
Importantly, we will achieve our targeted credit metrics within 12 months of closing. The purchase price of $3.625 billion will be funded through a mix of debt, equity-linked securities and cash on hand. Kirk will provide more detail around these and what it means for our capital allocation plan and financials in 2020 and '21. The approvals required to close this transaction includes HSR, FERC and the Canada Competition Act. Additionally, Centrica will hold a shareholder vote on the transaction within the next month. We target closing by the end of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. I want to briefly talk about how this transaction fits within our overall strategic road map. Since I became CEO 4.5 years ago, we have transformed our business from a highly levered IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet, established a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.
Our overarching commitment was to make sure you knew who we were and where we were heading with no head scratches. Along these lines, at our 2018 Analyst Day, we presented a strategic road map, which you can see on this slide. With 2020, marking the final year of our 3-year, 3-part transformation plan, we have now fully turned our attention to our next phase of redefining NRG and moving closer to the customer. Growing our Retail businesses positions the company to benefit from current market trends and better integrates complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain to further stabilize earnings, improve the quality of cash flows and lower our overall business risk profile.
Today's announcement is consistent with our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure while maintaining financial discipline. It is just another step we're taking that demonstrates our commitment to creating a best-in-class, customer-focused, integrated energy organization.
The acquisition of Direct Energy is highly complementary to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. When complete, NRG will have the strongest collection of competitive power brands offering energy products and services in North America.
NRG brands, including Reliant and Green Mountain, have been focused primarily on electricity customers with the highest concentration in Texas. The Direct Energy brands, including Airtron, significantly expands our mass and C&I footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas.
This portfolio not only enhances our current offerings, but it also adds complementary business such as natural gas. Direct Energy operates one of the largest natural gas retail platforms in the country, which we see as a logical extension of our current product offerings.
We have been impressed with the strong track record of Direct's retail gas business and expect they will benefit from operating on our platform and under our risk management program. The combined portfolio will continue to be heavily weighted towards the residential customer, allowing us the opportunity to provide an unparalleled level of innovation across products and services.
Both residential and business customers will be able to leverage our scope and design energy plants to fit their specific needs, taking consumer choice to a whole new level. And as we have seen time and time again, empowering customers with choice is both good for them and good for our business.
Before we move to the next slide, I want to briefly address the impact of COVID-19 on these consumer-facing platforms. Regarding NRG specifically, I have been impressed by the quick turn to digital selling when face-to-face marketing was paused due to state restrictions. The adaptability of the team to quickly evolve without missing a beat and deliver is a job well done. For Direct Energy, I will limit my commentary as we have not completed the acquisition. But I will say that we are comfortable with what we have seen and have taken the near-term impact of COVID-19 into our plans and expectations.
Now turning to Slide 8. This transaction provides a unique opportunity to achieve significant cost synergies, which we expect to total $300 million per year. These significant savings are possible by leveraging our integrated model and disciplined cost management that we have applied since 2016 and throughout our transformation plan. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, we expect to leverage our consolidated platform and processes, preserve the value-added talent and capabilities from the acquisition and focus our talent on optimizing the combined model.
Onetime costs to achieve will be $220 million, primarily for systems, process and personnel consolidation costs. Our proven model of integration results in a streamlined operating model that provides cost competitive products and places the customer at the center of everything we do.
Now turning to Slide 9, which provides the 3 pro forma run rate metrics. As you can see, this transaction creates tremendous shareholder value while maintaining significant financial flexibility, with $6 billion in excess cash generated through 2025, after achieving our target investment-grade metrics and growing our dividend at the midpoint of our 7% to 9% annual target. 
On one final note, before I move to our quarterly business update, I would like to take a moment to say to the Direct Energy team. We look forward to welcoming you to the NRG family. 
Moving to Slide 11. I want to provide you with a preview of our year-to-date results and other business updates. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we delivered $574 million of adjusted EBITDA, 22% higher than the same period last year.
The performance during the quarter was primarily driven by favorable weather, strong mass retail load as a result of stay-at-home restrictions and lower sales and marketing costs due to timing. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand at $922 million, a 15% increase from last year. And as a result of our strong performance over the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges. We expect to post the full earnings material and 10-Q on August 6. And given today's comprehensive strategy and capital allocation update, do not currently expect to host a call. 
Now moving to the right side of the slide. While we typically wait until the third quarter to initiate next year's guidance, in light of today's acquisition announcement, we're initiating 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion adjusted EBITDA and 2.275 -- $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion of free cash flow before growth. These guidance ranges further demonstrate our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions.
Moving to the bottom right portion of the slide, we're also announcing 3 strategic portfolio updates today. First, we are opportunistically buying out the Midwest Generation leases. As a reminder, these assets were acquired in 2014 as part of the Edison Mission transaction, and the leases have been in place since 2000. Consistent with our efforts to simplify our balance sheet and achieve investment-grade credit rating, we have successfully negotiated to buy out the leases. 
This action creates greater operational and financial flexibility with the assets. We expect the net cash cost to be $112 million. Next, we expect to monetize Agua Caliente, which was previously delayed by the PG&E bankruptcy. We expect net proceeds from this asset to total $120 million.
And finally, as we roll forward to 2021 capital allocation, we will be completing the Encina site improvement project, which began this year. We're allocating $25 million in 2021. And following completion, we expect to monetize the site at a return significantly exceeding our hurdle rates. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial update."

I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-dat",2039,"Thank you, Mauricio. I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. 
Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-date results and outlook over the balance of the year, which to be clear, includes lower expected COVID-related costs versus our last update, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for EBITDA and free cash flow for growth. Mauricio also mentioned, we've executed an agreement with the owner lessors of Powerton and Joliet to purchase those assets, thereby eliminating the lease obligations we assumed as a part of their acquisition.
As a lessor, we have kept those assets in compliance with environmental regulations through back end control investments and in the case of Joliet, by converting units from coal to natural gas. By purchasing these assets, we're able to eliminate the lease obligations, which are treated as debt for ratings purposes, thereby streamlining our balance sheet.
Moreover, as owners rather than lessors, we have a greater operational and strategic flexibility, thus providing us a greater range of alternatives to optimize their benefits to NRG going forward. The purchase of these assets will be funded with approximately $112 million of NRG capital. With the balance of the buy in, funded with debt, replacing the $148 million lease obligation on a credit neutral basis.
Turning to Slide 14. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation, which includes 2 notable changes. First, our investments increased primarily as a result of the Midwest Gen purchase.
And second, we're reserving the remaining balance of 2020 capital of $664 million in order to help fund the Direct acquisition, which we expect to close by early '21. We recognize that this results in a partial decrease of the capital previously earmarked for share repurchases under our 50-50 allocation policy. However, as I'll demonstrate shortly, we are confident that this is a superior use of this capital versus repurchasing our own stock.
Turning to the Direct acquisition and starting with sources and uses on Slide 15, the purchase price of Direct plus expected transaction costs and expenses, leads us to total uses of $3.775 billion. As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect to fund this with the following sources of capital. 
First, while we fully backstopped a bridge facility to fund the acquisition, our plan is to issue new secured and unsecured notes, likely prior to closing, to raise approximately $2.4 billion towards the acquisition. However, we view approximately $1.05 billion of this acquisition leverage to be temporary as we intend to delever by this amount using 2021 capital in order to rapidly return to our investment-grade metrics within the first year.
We view this as a capital allocation priority. And based on extensive discussions with the rating agencies who understand and appreciate this commitment, we expect favorable reports on NRG and the transaction in the very near future. With this anticipated support from the agencies and our confidence in returning to our target metrics, we expect this will put us on track to potentially earn an investment-grade rating by late next year or early '22, given the risk reducing impact of the transaction on our overall platform. 
We have also reserved approximately $750 million in potential market sourced equity which is a base case, we are showing as equity-linked or convertible securities. This was a critical component of our rating strategy, and we will be focused on optimizing the structure and magnitude of this portion of the capital sources for the acquisition. We will look to balance equity treatment, ratings impact and overall cost of capital and will select the ideal structure based on market conditions as we move closer to closing the transaction.
Finally, we will fund the balance of the purchase price with the 2020 excess capital I reviewed earlier.
Additionally, as noted on the slide, we'll be increasing our liquidity facilities in connection with the transaction as well, with a total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities, supplemented by excess capacity on our existing revolver, all of which is primarily intended to fund letters of credit in connection with hedging activities.
Our analysis and long track record of efficient collateral management gives us high confidence in our ability to leverage these strengths to significantly reduce these requirements as we integrate Direct. This opportunity will be further enhanced as we move to investment-grade as we expect at least $1.5 billion in reduced collateral needs, from an investment-grade ratings upgrade alone.
Finally, in order to ensure nimble access to cash and liquidity, we are increasing our minimum cash, which we deduct before calculating capital available for allocation by $150 million from $500 million currently to $650 million following the transaction. 
Turning next to Slide 16. I'll begin our review of the financial benefits of the Direct acquisition, with an overview of the 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance Mauricio provided, which will provide a baseline for the acquisition impact. We're initiating 2021 guidance of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and 1.7 -- $1.275 billion rather, and $1.475 billion in free cash flow before growth.
Our stand-alone guidance is consistent with 2020 expected results despite the backwardated power price curves, further underscoring the resilience of our integrated model. Although we expect to close the Direct acquisition by early 2021, we expect to realize the full run rate impact of the transaction by '23 due to the ramp-up in significant synergy benefits as well as the decreasing incremental interest costs associated with the transaction as we quickly repay a portion of the acquisition debt in '21 in order to return to our investment-grade credit metrics in the first year of the transaction.
Given our strong confidence in the ongoing resilience of our integrated model, we'll use the midpoint of NRG's 2021 guidance to show the full run rate financial power of the combination, which we'll realize by '23. 
Starting with 2021. Based on the assumption of a January 1 close, we expect Direct Energy to contribute an incremental $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. This consists of 3 components: first, baseline or run rate EBITDA before synergies of $440 million.
Second, we expect nearly half of the full amount of synergies of approximately $135 million in the first year of the acquisition. And finally, having assessed and risk-adjusted our expectations for Direct's 2021 financial results to allow for the possible impact of various COVID-19 outcomes, we've made a downward adjustment to the '21 expected EBITDA of approximately $75 million. We view these assumptions as potentially conservative as should this possible impact abate or moderate, we may see upside to the 2021 contribution from Direct.
As we increase to the full impact of synergies over the next 2 years, we expect Direct to contribute a total of $740 million in adjusted EBITDA or just under 5x adjusted EBITDA based on the purchase price, leading to $2.74 billion in total pro forma adjusted run rate EBITDA in 2023.
Turning to free cash flow before growth. In 2021, we expect Direct to contribute $240 million in incremental cash flow after deducting incremental acquisition debt interest of approximately $150 million, dividends on the new convertible preferred and other cash flow items.
As we will be repaying approximately $1.05 billion of debt in 2021 in order to return to our target credit metrics in the first year, we will realize approximately $50 million in lower interest from the acquisition going forward. We will, however, likely reduce or realized rather this reduction in interest by repaying higher coupon legacy NRG unsecured notes, which will become callable next year, helping us optimize interest savings from delevering. These savings, combined with the full impact of synergies, drive run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from the acquisition to $540 million by 2023.
As shown in the lower left of the slide, after giving effect for NRG capital allocated to the transaction, which totals approximately $1.94 billion, the run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from Direct implies a 28% free cash flow yield as compared to an approximate 17% yield on NRG shares at the current price, helping to underscore not only the compelling financial impact of the transaction on an absolute basis, but more importantly, relative to repurchasing our own stock with this excess capital as well.
Moreover, as we recognize, we must fully consider the financial impact of allocating capital to this transaction on a relative basis. To further illustrate this on the lower right corner of the slide, we've compared the free cash flow per share impact of repurchasing shares with the capital allocated toward Direct, using share prices ranging from the current level in the mid-30s to $42 a share, which is the 52-week high. As you can see, this implies a run rate impact of the Direct acquisition of approximately 8% to 13% accretion to free cash flow per share, importantly, on this relative basis.
Finally, by acquiring Direct, we are also able to use our substantial surplus of net operating losses to shield incremental cash taxes over most of the remaining decades, thereby accelerating their use and driving additional positive after-tax NPV of approximately $100 million versus the longer time frame over which we would have used them on a stand-alone basis. 
However, despite this accelerated use of NRG's NOLs, we do not expect to become a full cash taxpayer on a combined basis until late in this decade, providing ongoing substantial tax runway even when combined. 
Turning to 21 capital allocation on Slide 17. Starting with the midpoint of 2021 free cash flow before growth, which I reviewed earlier, we expect to supplement this excess capital through the planned sale of our remaining interest in Agua Caliente in early 2021, thereby augmenting capital available for allocation by an expected net $120 million and leading to $1.72 billion in excess cash before deducting the increase of minimum cash of $150 million.
This deduction leaves us at $1.57 billion in incremental 2021 capital available for allocation, which will be first allocated to reducing debt in order to return balance sheet metrics to our target levels.
As I mentioned previously, as opposed to repaying lower cost debt, we'll issue to fund Direct will augment the interest savings power by most likely targeting that higher coupon legacy unsecured debt, which is callable in 2021.
We then reserved $317 million for dividends based on the midpoint of our targeted dividend growth rate range of 7% to 9%. Finally, we have approximately $200 million in identified investments, primarily consisting of cost to achieve in connection with generating synergies from the Direct acquisition, leaving us then fully allocated for 2021. 
Following our return to investment-grade metrics in 2021, we plan to resume our policy of returning 50% of excess capital to shareholders with the remaining balance reserve for additional growth opportunities but remain flexible in increasing capital return to shareholders should superior investment opportunities not materialize. 
Finally, turning to our credit profile on Slide 17 and our continuing focus on maintaining our credit ratio and remaining on track to achieve investment grade. As shown on the table for 2021, on a stand-alone basis, we would be at the more favorable end of our targeted range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to corporate EBITDA.
When we then add the impact of this transaction, or approximately $1.5 billion of incremental debt, which is net of almost $1.1 billion in deleveraging in '21 and $500 million of incremental EBITDA, which was -- does not yet reflect the entire expected run rate synergies, our forecasted net debt to corporate EBITDA at the end of 2021 on a combined basis, will be close to the midpoint of our targeted range, remaining within our targeted credit metrics by the end of 2021 underscores our commitment to continuing on a path to achieving investment-grade in the near future, which we now expect would be possible at the end of 2021 or early '22, based on our continuing dialogue with the rating agencies about the strength of our integrated platform and this business risk reducing transaction.
Mauricio, I'll turn it back to you."

I mean before moving to closing remarks, I want to review our capital allocation road map on Slide 20. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It was built upon our long-term commitment of value creation.
As you can see in the bar chart on the left, we have been disciplined in deploying every dollar of our excess capital and adhering to our capital allocation principles. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly 5 years ago was to first leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and we have done that.
Next, it was to use our tremendous financial flexibility to deploy our excess cash in good, sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy.
If this was not an option, we would return capital back to shareholders. And we did, resulting in a nearly 25% reduction in our share count. Today's investment is consistent with our strategy and exceeds all financial hurdle rates.
We're using our financial flexibility to fund the project and expect to complete the deleveraging program in 2021. Then we would return to our target 50% growth and 50% return of capital objective in 2022.
Our dividend policy remains unchanged at 7% to 9% annual growth. This is a great transaction for NRG and will be a source of value creation for all our stakeholders in the years to come.
In closing, on Slide 21, I believe today's business update is another example of how everyone here at NRG remains focused on creating sustainable long-term value. This transaction is the right transaction. It expands our geographic reach and product offerings. It diversifies our business and reduces financial risks. It provides opportunities for significant synergies, enhancing our cost competitiveness and unlocking further value for our customers.
It improves our path to investment-grade and resilience once achieved. It enhances opportunities for organic growth and our ability to thrive through an increasingly cleaner and electrified economy. And it will create significant and sustainable shareholder value.

We will expand that to the East. I mean, remember, Shar, we don't have to -- I believe in the integrated platform today as much as I did yesterday and a year ago. But it doesn't mean that we have to own every single asset. We can own the asset. We can rent it, and then we can also lean on the bilateral wholesale market. So we have that optionality, and we're going to do what we believe is the most cost-efficient and profit maximizing way of doing it. So I feel very, very comfortable that now that we have this platform, we're going to be able to optimize it like we have optimized ERCOT. 
Your second question was about the makeup of the businesses. What I can tell you today, Shar, is I'm really, really excited about the platform that we're acquiring today. And this is no different than what we do at NRG. We're constantly evaluating and optimizing our portfolio. And once the Direct Energy is part of NRG, we're going to do the same thing with the same rigor. And -- but at this point, I am really excited about the entire business that we're acquiring."

If you begin the additive effect of that ongoing cash flow is buoyed by our now more resilient and diversified platform on a robust basis, I think it doesn't take very many years because you -- even after you deduct for the dividend, you can add those numbers up on flexibility of cash flow. And within a couple of 3 years, you start to get something close to the current market cap of the company. Again, not to say we intend to do that, but I'm just illustrating what that means by the order of magnitude over a relatively short period of time after we get past this deleveraging period."

We believe that the mega trends that we're seeing support that move on the energy value chain.

It expands our product offering beyond just electricity and natural gas and other services that allows us to reduce the acquisition cost and increases the stickiness with customers, and across our C&I business, at a time when you're seeing more onshoring of manufacturing in the United States, given the supply chain environment or more hostile environment in the world. And we are achieving all of that at a very attractive multiple of 4.9x, exceeding our investment hurdle rates, achieving a free cash flow yield on the capital of almost 30%. And all of that, we will get back to our targeted credit metrics within 12 months. I mean to me, that is an exciting, exciting value proposition, exciting acquisition.

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of operations. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the men and women of NRG who have been reporting to work during this pandemic at our power plants and customer care centers.
On behalf of everyone, thank you for keeping the lights on during this difficult time. Today, I'm pleased to share several important business updates as highlighted on Slide 3.
First, we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire Direct Energy, a highly complementary North American home and business retail company that advances our customer-focused strategy and strengthens our integrated platform. This is a compelling transaction that will greatly expand our retail footprint across North America and further diversify our product offerings and earnings.
Second, this transaction will create significant shareholder value. It exceeds our stated investment hurdle rates and strengthens our path to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. And finally, our integrated platform continues to deliver solid results. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance and initiating 2021 guidance in line with expectations.
I'd like to go right into a summary of the Direct Energy acquisition on Slide 5. This is the right transaction at the right time, and it represents a considerable opportunity for our business. Perfecting our integrated model means moving closer to the customer and rebalancing our retail generation portfolio.
These transactions does exactly that. It greatly expands and enhances our retail business by adding over 3 million electric, natural gas and service retail customers throughout the United States and Canada. It strengthens our core operating platform by creating a more balanced generation retail portfolio, particularly in the Northeast, where we can expand the capital-light renewable PPA strategy we have deployed in ERCOT. It adds a proven and well-established retail gas platform with national recognition and reach. It reduces our earnings mix from coal and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term emission reduction targets. And it creates significant value by leveraging our scalable operational platform. We expect to realize $300 million of cost synergies per year. This transaction is highly attractive and accretive. It exceeds our stated investment criteria, represents a multiple of 4.9x EBIT to EBITDA after synergies and a 28% free cash flow yield on our invested capital. 
Importantly, we will achieve our targeted credit metrics within 12 months of closing. The purchase price of $3.625 billion will be funded through a mix of debt, equity-linked securities and cash on hand. Kirk will provide more detail around these and what it means for our capital allocation plan and financials in 2020 and '21. The approvals required to close this transaction includes HSR, FERC and the Canada Competition Act. Additionally, Centrica will hold a shareholder vote on the transaction within the next month. We target closing by the end of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. I want to briefly talk about how this transaction fits within our overall strategic road map. Since I became CEO 4.5 years ago, we have transformed our business from a highly levered IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet, established a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.
Our overarching commitment was to make sure you knew who we were and where we were heading with no head scratches. Along these lines, at our 2018 Analyst Day, we presented a strategic road map, which you can see on this slide. With 2020, marking the final year of our 3-year, 3-part transformation plan, we have now fully turned our attention to our next phase of redefining NRG and moving closer to the customer. Growing our Retail businesses positions the company to benefit from current market trends and better integrates complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain to further stabilize earnings, improve the quality of cash flows and lower our overall business risk profile.
Today's announcement is consistent with our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure while maintaining financial discipline. It is just another step we're taking that demonstrates our commitment to creating a best-in-class, customer-focused, integrated energy organization.
The acquisition of Direct Energy is highly complementary to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. When complete, NRG will have the strongest collection of competitive power brands offering energy products and services in North America.
NRG brands, including Reliant and Green Mountain, have been focused primarily on electricity customers with the highest concentration in Texas. The Direct Energy brands, including Airtron, significantly expands our mass and C&I footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas.
This portfolio not only enhances our current offerings, but it also adds complementary business such as natural gas. Direct Energy operates one of the largest natural gas retail platforms in the country, which we see as a logical extension of our current product offerings.
We have been impressed with the strong track record of Direct's retail gas business and expect they will benefit from operating on our platform and under our risk management program. The combined portfolio will continue to be heavily weighted towards the residential customer, allowing us the opportunity to provide an unparalleled level of innovation across products and services.
Both residential and business customers will be able to leverage our scope and design energy plants to fit their specific needs, taking consumer choice to a whole new level. And as we have seen time and time again, empowering customers with choice is both good for them and good for our business.
Before we move to the next slide, I want to briefly address the impact of COVID-19 on these consumer-facing platforms. Regarding NRG specifically, I have been impressed by the quick turn to digital selling when face-to-face marketing was paused due to state restrictions. The adaptability of the team to quickly evolve without missing a beat and deliver is a job well done. For Direct Energy, I will limit my commentary as we have not completed the acquisition. But I will say that we are comfortable with what we have seen and have taken the near-term impact of COVID-19 into our plans and expectations.
Now turning to Slide 8. This transaction provides a unique opportunity to achieve significant cost synergies, which we expect to total $300 million per year. These significant savings are possible by leveraging our integrated model and disciplined cost management that we have applied since 2016 and throughout our transformation plan. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, we expect to leverage our consolidated platform and processes, preserve the value-added talent and capabilities from the acquisition and focus our talent on optimizing the combined model.
Onetime costs to achieve will be $220 million, primarily for systems, process and personnel consolidation costs. Our proven model of integration results in a streamlined operating model that provides cost competitive products and places the customer at the center of everything we do.
Now turning to Slide 9, which provides the 3 pro forma run rate metrics. As you can see, this transaction creates tremendous shareholder value while maintaining significant financial flexibility, with $6 billion in excess cash generated through 2025, after achieving our target investment-grade metrics and growing our dividend at the midpoint of our 7% to 9% annual target. 
On one final note, before I move to our quarterly business update, I would like to take a moment to say to the Direct Energy team. We look forward to welcoming you to the NRG family. 
Moving to Slide 11. I want to provide you with a preview of our year-to-date results and other business updates. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we delivered $574 million of adjusted EBITDA, 22% higher than the same period last year.
The performance during the quarter was primarily driven by favorable weather, strong mass retail load as a result of stay-at-home restrictions and lower sales and marketing costs due to timing. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand at $922 million, a 15% increase from last year. And as a result of our strong performance over the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges. We expect to post the full earnings material and 10-Q on August 6. And given today's comprehensive strategy and capital allocation update, do not currently expect to host a call. 
Now moving to the right side of the slide. While we typically wait until the third quarter to initiate next year's guidance, in light of today's acquisition announcement, we're initiating 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion adjusted EBITDA and 2.275 -- $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion of free cash flow before growth. These guidance ranges further demonstrate our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions.
Moving to the bottom right portion of the slide, we're also announcing 3 strategic portfolio updates today. First, we are opportunistically buying out the Midwest Generation leases. As a reminder, these assets were acquired in 2014 as part of the Edison Mission transaction, and the leases have been in place since 2000. Consistent with our efforts to simplify our balance sheet and achieve investment-grade credit rating, we have successfully negotiated to buy out the leases. 
This action creates greater operational and financial flexibility with the assets. We expect the net cash cost to be $112 million. Next, we expect to monetize Agua Caliente, which was previously delayed by the PG&E bankruptcy. We expect net proceeds from this asset to total $120 million.
And finally, as we roll forward to 2021 capital allocation, we will be completing the Encina site improvement project, which began this year. We're allocating $25 million in 2021. And following completion, we expect to monetize the site at a return significantly exceeding our hurdle rates. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial update."

I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-dat",2039,"Thank you, Mauricio. I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. 
Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-date results and outlook over the balance of the year, which to be clear, includes lower expected COVID-related costs versus our last update, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for EBITDA and free cash flow for growth. Mauricio also mentioned, we've executed an agreement with the owner lessors of Powerton and Joliet to purchase those assets, thereby eliminating the lease obligations we assumed as a part of their acquisition.
As a lessor, we have kept those assets in compliance with environmental regulations through back end control investments and in the case of Joliet, by converting units from coal to natural gas. By purchasing these assets, we're able to eliminate the lease obligations, which are treated as debt for ratings purposes, thereby streamlining our balance sheet.
Moreover, as owners rather than lessors, we have a greater operational and strategic flexibility, thus providing us a greater range of alternatives to optimize their benefits to NRG going forward. The purchase of these assets will be funded with approximately $112 million of NRG capital. With the balance of the buy in, funded with debt, replacing the $148 million lease obligation on a credit neutral basis.
Turning to Slide 14. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation, which includes 2 notable changes. First, our investments increased primarily as a result of the Midwest Gen purchase.
And second, we're reserving the remaining balance of 2020 capital of $664 million in order to help fund the Direct acquisition, which we expect to close by early '21. We recognize that this results in a partial decrease of the capital previously earmarked for share repurchases under our 50-50 allocation policy. However, as I'll demonstrate shortly, we are confident that this is a superior use of this capital versus repurchasing our own stock.
Turning to the Direct acquisition and starting with sources and uses on Slide 15, the purchase price of Direct plus expected transaction costs and expenses, leads us to total uses of $3.775 billion. As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect to fund this with the following sources of capital. 
First, while we fully backstopped a bridge facility to fund the acquisition, our plan is to issue new secured and unsecured notes, likely prior to closing, to raise approximately $2.4 billion towards the acquisition. However, we view approximately $1.05 billion of this acquisition leverage to be temporary as we intend to delever by this amount using 2021 capital in order to rapidly return to our investment-grade metrics within the first year.
We view this as a capital allocation priority. And based on extensive discussions with the rating agencies who understand and appreciate this commitment, we expect favorable reports on NRG and the transaction in the very near future. With this anticipated support from the agencies and our confidence in returning to our target metrics, we expect this will put us on track to potentially earn an investment-grade rating by late next year or early '22, given the risk reducing impact of the transaction on our overall platform. 
We have also reserved approximately $750 million in potential market sourced equity which is a base case, we are showing as equity-linked or convertible securities. This was a critical component of our rating strategy, and we will be focused on optimizing the structure and magnitude of this portion of the capital sources for the acquisition. We will look to balance equity treatment, ratings impact and overall cost of capital and will select the ideal structure based on market conditions as we move closer to closing the transaction.
Finally, we will fund the balance of the purchase price with the 2020 excess capital I reviewed earlier.
Additionally, as noted on the slide, we'll be increasing our liquidity facilities in connection with the transaction as well, with a total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities, supplemented by excess capacity on our existing revolver, all of which is primarily intended to fund letters of credit in connection with hedging activities.
Our analysis and long track record of efficient collateral management gives us high confidence in our ability to leverage these strengths to significantly reduce these requirements as we integrate Direct. This opportunity will be further enhanced as we move to investment-grade as we expect at least $1.5 billion in reduced collateral needs, from an investment-grade ratings upgrade alone.
Finally, in order to ensure nimble access to cash and liquidity, we are increasing our minimum cash, which we deduct before calculating capital available for allocation by $150 million from $500 million currently to $650 million following the transaction. 
Turning next to Slide 16. I'll begin our review of the financial benefits of the Direct acquisition, with an overview of the 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance Mauricio provided, which will provide a baseline for the acquisition impact. We're initiating 2021 guidance of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and 1.7 -- $1.275 billion rather, and $1.475 billion in free cash flow before growth.
Our stand-alone guidance is consistent with 2020 expected results despite the backwardated power price curves, further underscoring the resilience of our integrated model. Although we expect to close the Direct acquisition by early 2021, we expect to realize the full run rate impact of the transaction by '23 due to the ramp-up in significant synergy benefits as well as the decreasing incremental interest costs associated with the transaction as we quickly repay a portion of the acquisition debt in '21 in order to return to our investment-grade credit metrics in the first year of the transaction.
Given our strong confidence in the ongoing resilience of our integrated model, we'll use the midpoint of NRG's 2021 guidance to show the full run rate financial power of the combination, which we'll realize by '23. 
Starting with 2021. Based on the assumption of a January 1 close, we expect Direct Energy to contribute an incremental $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. This consists of 3 components: first, baseline or run rate EBITDA before synergies of $440 million.
Second, we expect nearly half of the full amount of synergies of approximately $135 million in the first year of the acquisition. And finally, having assessed and risk-adjusted our expectations for Direct's 2021 financial results to allow for the possible impact of various COVID-19 outcomes, we've made a downward adjustment to the '21 expected EBITDA of approximately $75 million. We view these assumptions as potentially conservative as should this possible impact abate or moderate, we may see upside to the 2021 contribution from Direct.
As we increase to the full impact of synergies over the next 2 years, we expect Direct to contribute a total of $740 million in adjusted EBITDA or just under 5x adjusted EBITDA based on the purchase price, leading to $2.74 billion in total pro forma adjusted run rate EBITDA in 2023.
Turning to free cash flow before growth. In 2021, we expect Direct to contribute $240 million in incremental cash flow after deducting incremental acquisition debt interest of approximately $150 million, dividends on the new convertible preferred and other cash flow items.
As we will be repaying approximately $1.05 billion of debt in 2021 in order to return to our target credit metrics in the first year, we will realize approximately $50 million in lower interest from the acquisition going forward. We will, however, likely reduce or realized rather this reduction in interest by repaying higher coupon legacy NRG unsecured notes, which will become callable next year, helping us optimize interest savings from delevering. These savings, combined with the full impact of synergies, drive run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from the acquisition to $540 million by 2023.
As shown in the lower left of the slide, after giving effect for NRG capital allocated to the transaction, which totals approximately $1.94 billion, the run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from Direct implies a 28% free cash flow yield as compared to an approximate 17% yield on NRG shares at the current price, helping to underscore not only the compelling financial impact of the transaction on an absolute basis, but more importantly, relative to repurchasing our own stock with this excess capital as well.
Moreover, as we recognize, we must fully consider the financial impact of allocating capital to this transaction on a relative basis. To further illustrate this on the lower right corner of the slide, we've compared the free cash flow per share impact of repurchasing shares with the capital allocated toward Direct, using share prices ranging from the current level in the mid-30s to $42 a share, which is the 52-week high. As you can see, this implies a run rate impact of the Direct acquisition of approximately 8% to 13% accretion to free cash flow per share, importantly, on this relative basis.
Finally, by acquiring Direct, we are also able to use our substantial surplus of net operating losses to shield incremental cash taxes over most of the remaining decades, thereby accelerating their use and driving additional positive after-tax NPV of approximately $100 million versus the longer time frame over which we would have used them on a stand-alone basis. 
However, despite this accelerated use of NRG's NOLs, we do not expect to become a full cash taxpayer on a combined basis until late in this decade, providing ongoing substantial tax runway even when combined. 
Turning to 21 capital allocation on Slide 17. Starting with the midpoint of 2021 free cash flow before growth, which I reviewed earlier, we expect to supplement this excess capital through the planned sale of our remaining interest in Agua Caliente in early 2021, thereby augmenting capital available for allocation by an expected net $120 million and leading to $1.72 billion in excess cash before deducting the increase of minimum cash of $150 million.
This deduction leaves us at $1.57 billion in incremental 2021 capital available for allocation, which will be first allocated to reducing debt in order to return balance sheet metrics to our target levels.
As I mentioned previously, as opposed to repaying lower cost debt, we'll issue to fund Direct will augment the interest savings power by most likely targeting that higher coupon legacy unsecured debt, which is callable in 2021.
We then reserved $317 million for dividends based on the midpoint of our targeted dividend growth rate range of 7% to 9%. Finally, we have approximately $200 million in identified investments, primarily consisting of cost to achieve in connection with generating synergies from the Direct acquisition, leaving us then fully allocated for 2021. 
Following our return to investment-grade metrics in 2021, we plan to resume our policy of returning 50% of excess capital to shareholders with the remaining balance reserve for additional growth opportunities but remain flexible in increasing capital return to shareholders should superior investment opportunities not materialize. 
Finally, turning to our credit profile on Slide 17 and our continuing focus on maintaining our credit ratio and remaining on track to achieve investment grade. As shown on the table for 2021, on a stand-alone basis, we would be at the more favorable end of our targeted range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to corporate EBITDA.
When we then add the impact of this transaction, or approximately $1.5 billion of incremental debt, which is net of almost $1.1 billion in deleveraging in '21 and $500 million of incremental EBITDA, which was -- does not yet reflect the entire expected run rate synergies, our forecasted net debt to corporate EBITDA at the end of 2021 on a combined basis, will be close to the midpoint of our targeted range, remaining within our targeted credit metrics by the end of 2021 underscores our commitment to continuing on a path to achieving investment-grade in the near future, which we now expect would be possible at the end of 2021 or early '22, based on our continuing dialogue with the rating agencies about the strength of our integrated platform and this business risk reducing transaction.
Mauricio, I'll turn it back to you."

I mean before moving to closing remarks, I want to review our capital allocation road map on Slide 20. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It was built upon our long-term commitment of value creation.
As you can see in the bar chart on the left, we have been disciplined in deploying every dollar of our excess capital and adhering to our capital allocation principles. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly 5 years ago was to first leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and we have done that.
Next, it was to use our tremendous financial flexibility to deploy our excess cash in good, sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy.
If this was not an option, we would return capital back to shareholders. And we did, resulting in a nearly 25% reduction in our share count. Today's investment is consistent with our strategy and exceeds all financial hurdle rates.
We're using our financial flexibility to fund the project and expect to complete the deleveraging program in 2021. Then we would return to our target 50% growth and 50% return of capital objective in 2022.
Our dividend policy remains unchanged at 7% to 9% annual growth. This is a great transaction for NRG and will be a source of value creation for all our stakeholders in the years to come.
In closing, on Slide 21, I believe today's business update is another example of how everyone here at NRG remains focused on creating sustainable long-term value. This transaction is the right transaction. It expands our geographic reach and product offerings. It diversifies our business and reduces financial risks. It provides opportunities for significant synergies, enhancing our cost competitiveness and unlocking further value for our customers.
It improves our path to investment-grade and resilience once achieved. It enhances opportunities for organic growth and our ability to thrive through an increasingly cleaner and electrified economy. And it will create significant and sustainable shareholder value.

And when we get closer to 2022, we're going to evaluate the opportunities. But Kirk, I mean, do you have anything else on the..."

I mean, certainly, the rearing, the 50-50 program is important and not to belie our intentions because, obviously, we make those decisions when the time comes. But I think it's important to illustrate the order of magnitude here since we're not increasing the common share count that if you extrapolate that run rate free cash flow, and take out since we're basically back to 0 level on our objectives from a balance sheet standpoint beyond '21. 
If you begin the additive effect of that ongoing cash flow is buoyed by our now more resilient and diversified platform on a robust basis, I think it doesn't take very many years because you -- even after you deduct for the dividend, you can add those numbers up on flexibility of cash flow. And within a couple of 3 years, you start to get something close to the current market cap of the company. Again, not to say we intend to do that, but I'm just illustrating what that means by the order of magnitude over a relatively short period of time after we get past this deleveraging period."

We believe that the mega trends that we're seeing support that move on the energy value chain. And if you think about what this transaction does for us, it doubles the size of our Retail Mass business. It balances our generation and retail portfolio in the East. It adds a very well-respected national gas retail platform. It expands our product offering beyond just electricity and natural gas and other services that allows us to reduce the acquisition cost and increases the stickiness with customers, and across our C&I business, at a time when you're seeing more onshoring of manufacturing in the United States, given the supply chain environment or more hostile environment in the world. And we are achieving all of that at a very attractive multiple of 4.9x, exceeding our investment hurdle rates, achieving a free cash flow yield on the capital of almost 30%. And all of that, we will get back to our targeted credit metrics within 12 months. I mean to me, that is an exciting, exciting value proposition, exciting acquisition. And obviously then, we will be focusing on getting the approvals that are necessary, closing the transaction and focusing on the integration of this business."

I'm joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of operations. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the men and women of NRG who have been reporting to work during this pandemic at our power plants and customer care centers.
On behalf of everyone, thank you for keeping the lights on during this difficult time. Today, I'm pleased to share several important business updates as highlighted on Slide 3.
First, we have reached a definitive agreement to acquire Direct Energy, a highly complementary North American home and business retail company that advances our customer-focused strategy and strengthens our integrated platform. This is a compelling transaction that will greatly expand our retail footprint across North America and further diversify our product offerings and earnings.
Second, this transaction will create significant shareholder value. It exceeds our stated investment hurdle rates and strengthens our path to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. And finally, our integrated platform continues to deliver solid results. We are reaffirming our 2020 guidance and initiating 2021 guidance in line with expectations.
I'd like to go right into a summary of the Direct Energy acquisition on Slide 5. This is the right transaction at the right time, and it represents a considerable opportunity for our business. Perfecting our integrated model means moving closer to the customer and rebalancing our retail generation portfolio.
These transactions does exactly that. It greatly expands and enhances our retail business by adding over 3 million electric, natural gas and service retail customers throughout the United States and Canada. It strengthens our core operating platform by creating a more balanced generation retail portfolio, particularly in the Northeast, where we can expand the capital-light renewable PPA strategy we have deployed in ERCOT. It adds a proven and well-established retail gas platform with national recognition and reach. It reduces our earnings mix from coal and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term emission reduction targets. And it creates significant value by leveraging our scalable operational platform. We expect to realize $300 million of cost synergies per year. This transaction is highly attractive and accretive. It exceeds our stated investment criteria, represents a multiple of 4.9x EBIT to EBITDA after synergies and a 28% free cash flow yield on our invested capital. 
Importantly, we will achieve our targeted credit metrics within 12 months of closing. The purchase price of $3.625 billion will be funded through a mix of debt, equity-linked securities and cash on hand. Kirk will provide more detail around these and what it means for our capital allocation plan and financials in 2020 and '21. The approvals required to close this transaction includes HSR, FERC and the Canada Competition Act. Additionally, Centrica will hold a shareholder vote on the transaction within the next month. We target closing by the end of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 6. I want to briefly talk about how this transaction fits within our overall strategic road map. Since I became CEO 4.5 years ago, we have transformed our business from a highly levered IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet, established a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation.
Our overarching commitment was to make sure you knew who we were and where we were heading with no head scratches. Along these lines, at our 2018 Analyst Day, we presented a strategic road map, which you can see on this slide. With 2020, marking the final year of our 3-year, 3-part transformation plan, we have now fully turned our attention to our next phase of redefining NRG and moving closer to the customer. Growing our Retail businesses positions the company to benefit from current market trends and better integrates complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain to further stabilize earnings, improve the quality of cash flows and lower our overall business risk profile.
Today's announcement is consistent with our plan to rebalance our portfolio, reorganize around the customer and continuously improve our business and cost structure while maintaining financial discipline. It is just another step we're taking that demonstrates our commitment to creating a best-in-class, customer-focused, integrated energy organization.
The acquisition of Direct Energy is highly complementary to our business, as you can see on Slide 7. When complete, NRG will have the strongest collection of competitive power brands offering energy products and services in North America.
NRG brands, including Reliant and Green Mountain, have been focused primarily on electricity customers with the highest concentration in Texas. The Direct Energy brands, including Airtron, significantly expands our mass and C&I footprint beyond electricity and outside of Texas.
This portfolio not only enhances our current offerings, but it also adds complementary business such as natural gas. Direct Energy operates one of the largest natural gas retail platforms in the country, which we see as a logical extension of our current product offerings.
We have been impressed with the strong track record of Direct's retail gas business and expect they will benefit from operating on our platform and under our risk management program. The combined portfolio will continue to be heavily weighted towards the residential customer, allowing us the opportunity to provide an unparalleled level of innovation across products and services.
Both residential and business customers will be able to leverage our scope and design energy plants to fit their specific needs, taking consumer choice to a whole new level. And as we have seen time and time again, empowering customers with choice is both good for them and good for our business.
Before we move to the next slide, I want to briefly address the impact of COVID-19 on these consumer-facing platforms. Regarding NRG specifically, I have been impressed by the quick turn to digital selling when face-to-face marketing was paused due to state restrictions. The adaptability of the team to quickly evolve without missing a beat and deliver is a job well done. For Direct Energy, I will limit my commentary as we have not completed the acquisition. But I will say that we are comfortable with what we have seen and have taken the near-term impact of COVID-19 into our plans and expectations.
Now turning to Slide 8. This transaction provides a unique opportunity to achieve significant cost synergies, which we expect to total $300 million per year. These significant savings are possible by leveraging our integrated model and disciplined cost management that we have applied since 2016 and throughout our transformation plan. Given the complementary nature of both businesses, we expect to leverage our consolidated platform and processes, preserve the value-added talent and capabilities from the acquisition and focus our talent on optimizing the combined model.
Onetime costs to achieve will be $220 million, primarily for systems, process and personnel consolidation costs. Our proven model of integration results in a streamlined operating model that provides cost competitive products and places the customer at the center of everything we do.
Now turning to Slide 9, which provides the 3 pro forma run rate metrics. As you can see, this transaction creates tremendous shareholder value while maintaining significant financial flexibility, with $6 billion in excess cash generated through 2025, after achieving our target investment-grade metrics and growing our dividend at the midpoint of our 7% to 9% annual target. 
On one final note, before I move to our quarterly business update, I would like to take a moment to say to the Direct Energy team. We look forward to welcoming you to the NRG family. 
Moving to Slide 11. I want to provide you with a preview of our year-to-date results and other business updates. As you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, during the quarter, we delivered $574 million of adjusted EBITDA, 22% higher than the same period last year.
The performance during the quarter was primarily driven by favorable weather, strong mass retail load as a result of stay-at-home restrictions and lower sales and marketing costs due to timing. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA results now stand at $922 million, a 15% increase from last year. And as a result of our strong performance over the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges. We expect to post the full earnings material and 10-Q on August 6. And given today's comprehensive strategy and capital allocation update, do not currently expect to host a call. 
Now moving to the right side of the slide. While we typically wait until the third quarter to initiate next year's guidance, in light of today's acquisition announcement, we're initiating 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion adjusted EBITDA and 2.275 -- $1.275 billion to $1.475 billion of free cash flow before growth. These guidance ranges further demonstrate our ability to deliver stable and predictable results through varying market conditions.
Moving to the bottom right portion of the slide, we're also announcing 3 strategic portfolio updates today. First, we are opportunistically buying out the Midwest Generation leases. As a reminder, these assets were acquired in 2014 as part of the Edison Mission transaction, and the leases have been in place since 2000. Consistent with our efforts to simplify our balance sheet and achieve investment-grade credit rating, we have successfully negotiated to buy out the leases. 
This action creates greater operational and financial flexibility with the assets. We expect the net cash cost to be $112 million. Next, we expect to monetize Agua Caliente, which was previously delayed by the PG&E bankruptcy. We expect net proceeds from this asset to total $120 million.
And finally, as we roll forward to 2021 capital allocation, we will be completing the Encina site improvement project, which began this year. We're allocating $25 million in 2021. And following completion, we expect to monetize the site at a return significantly exceeding our hurdle rates. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial update."

I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-dat",2039,"Thank you, Mauricio. I'll begin on Slide 13 by expanding just a bit on the summary of our second quarter highlights that Mauricio just provided before providing a financial overview of the Direct acquisition. 
Mauricio mentioned, based on our year-to-date results and outlook over the balance of the year, which to be clear, includes lower expected COVID-related costs versus our last update, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for EBITDA and free cash flow for growth. Mauricio also mentioned, we've executed an agreement with the owner lessors of Powerton and Joliet to purchase those assets, thereby eliminating the lease obligations we assumed as a part of their acquisition.
As a lessor, we have kept those assets in compliance with environmental regulations through back end control investments and in the case of Joliet, by converting units from coal to natural gas. By purchasing these assets, we're able to eliminate the lease obligations, which are treated as debt for ratings purposes, thereby streamlining our balance sheet.
Moreover, as owners rather than lessors, we have a greater operational and strategic flexibility, thus providing us a greater range of alternatives to optimize their benefits to NRG going forward. The purchase of these assets will be funded with approximately $112 million of NRG capital. With the balance of the buy in, funded with debt, replacing the $148 million lease obligation on a credit neutral basis.
Turning to Slide 14. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation, which includes 2 notable changes. First, our investments increased primarily as a result of the Midwest Gen purchase.
And second, we're reserving the remaining balance of 2020 capital of $664 million in order to help fund the Direct acquisition, which we expect to close by early '21. We recognize that this results in a partial decrease of the capital previously earmarked for share repurchases under our 50-50 allocation policy. However, as I'll demonstrate shortly, we are confident that this is a superior use of this capital versus repurchasing our own stock.
Turning to the Direct acquisition and starting with sources and uses on Slide 15, the purchase price of Direct plus expected transaction costs and expenses, leads us to total uses of $3.775 billion. As shown on the right side of the slide, we expect to fund this with the following sources of capital. 
First, while we fully backstopped a bridge facility to fund the acquisition, our plan is to issue new secured and unsecured notes, likely prior to closing, to raise approximately $2.4 billion towards the acquisition. However, we view approximately $1.05 billion of this acquisition leverage to be temporary as we intend to delever by this amount using 2021 capital in order to rapidly return to our investment-grade metrics within the first year.
We view this as a capital allocation priority. And based on extensive discussions with the rating agencies who understand and appreciate this commitment, we expect favorable reports on NRG and the transaction in the very near future. With this anticipated support from the agencies and our confidence in returning to our target metrics, we expect this will put us on track to potentially earn an investment-grade rating by late next year or early '22, given the risk reducing impact of the transaction on our overall platform. 
We have also reserved approximately $750 million in potential market sourced equity which is a base case, we are showing as equity-linked or convertible securities. This was a critical component of our rating strategy, and we will be focused on optimizing the structure and magnitude of this portion of the capital sources for the acquisition. We will look to balance equity treatment, ratings impact and overall cost of capital and will select the ideal structure based on market conditions as we move closer to closing the transaction.
Finally, we will fund the balance of the purchase price with the 2020 excess capital I reviewed earlier.
Additionally, as noted on the slide, we'll be increasing our liquidity facilities in connection with the transaction as well, with a total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities, supplemented by excess capacity on our existing revolver, all of which is primarily intended to fund letters of credit in connection with hedging activities.
Our analysis and long track record of efficient collateral management gives us high confidence in our ability to leverage these strengths to significantly reduce these requirements as we integrate Direct. This opportunity will be further enhanced as we move to investment-grade as we expect at least $1.5 billion in reduced collateral needs, from an investment-grade ratings upgrade alone.
Finally, in order to ensure nimble access to cash and liquidity, we are increasing our minimum cash, which we deduct before calculating capital available for allocation by $150 million from $500 million currently to $650 million following the transaction. 
Turning next to Slide 16. I'll begin our review of the financial benefits of the Direct acquisition, with an overview of the 2021 NRG stand-alone guidance Mauricio provided, which will provide a baseline for the acquisition impact. We're initiating 2021 guidance of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and 1.7 -- $1.275 billion rather, and $1.475 billion in free cash flow before growth.
Our stand-alone guidance is consistent with 2020 expected results despite the backwardated power price curves, further underscoring the resilience of our integrated model. Although we expect to close the Direct acquisition by early 2021, we expect to realize the full run rate impact of the transaction by '23 due to the ramp-up in significant synergy benefits as well as the decreasing incremental interest costs associated with the transaction as we quickly repay a portion of the acquisition debt in '21 in order to return to our investment-grade credit metrics in the first year of the transaction.
Given our strong confidence in the ongoing resilience of our integrated model, we'll use the midpoint of NRG's 2021 guidance to show the full run rate financial power of the combination, which we'll realize by '23. 
Starting with 2021. Based on the assumption of a January 1 close, we expect Direct Energy to contribute an incremental $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. This consists of 3 components: first, baseline or run rate EBITDA before synergies of $440 million.
Second, we expect nearly half of the full amount of synergies of approximately $135 million in the first year of the acquisition. And finally, having assessed and risk-adjusted our expectations for Direct's 2021 financial results to allow for the possible impact of various COVID-19 outcomes, we've made a downward adjustment to the '21 expected EBITDA of approximately $75 million. We view these assumptions as potentially conservative as should this possible impact abate or moderate, we may see upside to the 2021 contribution from Direct.
As we increase to the full impact of synergies over the next 2 years, we expect Direct to contribute a total of $740 million in adjusted EBITDA or just under 5x adjusted EBITDA based on the purchase price, leading to $2.74 billion in total pro forma adjusted run rate EBITDA in 2023.
Turning to free cash flow before growth. In 2021, we expect Direct to contribute $240 million in incremental cash flow after deducting incremental acquisition debt interest of approximately $150 million, dividends on the new convertible preferred and other cash flow items.
As we will be repaying approximately $1.05 billion of debt in 2021 in order to return to our target credit metrics in the first year, we will realize approximately $50 million in lower interest from the acquisition going forward. We will, however, likely reduce or realized rather this reduction in interest by repaying higher coupon legacy NRG unsecured notes, which will become callable next year, helping us optimize interest savings from delevering. These savings, combined with the full impact of synergies, drive run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from the acquisition to $540 million by 2023.
As shown in the lower left of the slide, after giving effect for NRG capital allocated to the transaction, which totals approximately $1.94 billion, the run rate incremental free cash flow before growth from Direct implies a 28% free cash flow yield as compared to an approximate 17% yield on NRG shares at the current price, helping to underscore not only the compelling financial impact of the transaction on an absolute basis, but more importantly, relative to repurchasing our own stock with this excess capital as well.
Moreover, as we recognize, we must fully consider the financial impact of allocating capital to this transaction on a relative basis. To further illustrate this on the lower right corner of the slide, we've compared the free cash flow per share impact of repurchasing shares with the capital allocated toward Direct, using share prices ranging from the current level in the mid-30s to $42 a share, which is the 52-week high. As you can see, this implies a run rate impact of the Direct acquisition of approximately 8% to 13% accretion to free cash flow per share, importantly, on this relative basis.
Finally, by acquiring Direct, we are also able to use our substantial surplus of net operating losses to shield incremental cash taxes over most of the remaining decades, thereby accelerating their use and driving additional positive after-tax NPV of approximately $100 million versus the longer time frame over which we would have used them on a stand-alone basis. 
However, despite this accelerated use of NRG's NOLs, we do not expect to become a full cash taxpayer on a combined basis until late in this decade, providing ongoing substantial tax runway even when combined. 
Turning to 21 capital allocation on Slide 17. Starting with the midpoint of 2021 free cash flow before growth, which I reviewed earlier, we expect to supplement this excess capital through the planned sale of our remaining interest in Agua Caliente in early 2021, thereby augmenting capital available for allocation by an expected net $120 million and leading to $1.72 billion in excess cash before deducting the increase of minimum cash of $150 million.
This deduction leaves us at $1.57 billion in incremental 2021 capital available for allocation, which will be first allocated to reducing debt in order to return balance sheet metrics to our target levels.
As I mentioned previously, as opposed to repaying lower cost debt, we'll issue to fund Direct will augment the interest savings power by most likely targeting that higher coupon legacy unsecured debt, which is callable in 2021.
We then reserved $317 million for dividends based on the midpoint of our targeted dividend growth rate range of 7% to 9%. Finally, we have approximately $200 million in identified investments, primarily consisting of cost to achieve in connection with generating synergies from the Direct acquisition, leaving us then fully allocated for 2021. 
Following our return to investment-grade metrics in 2021, we plan to resume our policy of returning 50% of excess capital to shareholders with the remaining balance reserve for additional growth opportunities but remain flexible in increasing capital return to shareholders should superior investment opportunities not materialize. 
Finally, turning to our credit profile on Slide 17 and our continuing focus on maintaining our credit ratio and remaining on track to achieve investment grade. As shown on the table for 2021, on a stand-alone basis, we would be at the more favorable end of our targeted range of 2.5 to 2.75x net debt to corporate EBITDA.
When we then add the impact of this transaction, or approximately $1.5 billion of incremental debt, which is net of almost $1.1 billion in deleveraging in '21 and $500 million of incremental EBITDA, which was -- does not yet reflect the entire expected run rate synergies, our forecasted net debt to corporate EBITDA at the end of 2021 on a combined basis, will be close to the midpoint of our targeted range, remaining within our targeted credit metrics by the end of 2021 underscores our commitment to continuing on a path to achieving investment-grade in the near future, which we now expect would be possible at the end of 2021 or early '22, based on our continuing dialogue with the rating agencies about the strength of our integrated platform and this business risk reducing transaction.
Mauricio, I'll turn it back to you."

I mean before moving to closing remarks, I want to review our capital allocation road map on Slide 20. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It was built upon our long-term commitment of value creation.
As you can see in the bar chart on the left, we have been disciplined in deploying every dollar of our excess capital and adhering to our capital allocation principles. If you recall, my first commitment to you nearly 5 years ago was to first leave no doubt in our balance sheet strength, and we have done that.
Next, it was to use our tremendous financial flexibility to deploy our excess cash in good, sound investments that meet our financial thresholds and are consistent with our strategy.
If this was not an option, we would return capital back to shareholders. And we did, resulting in a nearly 25% reduction in our share count. Today's investment is consistent with our strategy and exceeds all financial hurdle rates.
We're using our financial flexibility to fund the project and expect to complete the deleveraging program in 2021. Then we would return to our target 50% growth and 50% return of capital objective in 2022.
Our dividend policy remains unchanged at 7% to 9% annual growth. This is a great transaction for NRG and will be a source of value creation for all our stakeholders in the years to come.
In closing, on Slide 21, I believe today's business update is another example of how everyone here at NRG remains focused on creating sustainable long-term value. This transaction is the right transaction. It expands our geographic reach and product offerings. It diversifies our business and reduces financial risks. It provides opportunities for significant synergies, enhancing our cost competitiveness and unlocking further value for our customers.
It improves our path to investment-grade and resilience once achieved. It enhances opportunities for organic growth and our ability to thrive through an increasingly cleaner and electrified economy. And it will create significant and sustainable shareholder value. 
Thank you for your time today, and I also look forward to providing all our stakeholders more information during our Analyst Day in early 2021. Catherine, with that, we're ready to take questions."

We believe that the mega trends that we're seeing support that move on the energy value chain. And if you think about what this transaction does for us, it doubles the size of our Retail Mass business. It balances our generation and retail portfolio in the East. It adds a very well-respected national gas retail platform. It expands our product offering beyond just electricity and natural gas and other services that allows us to reduce the acquisition cost and increases the stickiness with customers, and across our C&I business, at a time when you're seeing more onshoring of manufacturing in the United States, given the supply chain environment or more hostile environment in the world. And we are achieving all of that at a very attractive multiple of 4.9x, exceeding our investment hurdle rates, achieving a free cash flow yield on the capital of almost 30%. And all of that, we will get back to our targeted credit metrics within 12 months. I mean to me, that is an exciting, exciting value proposition, exciting acquisition. And obviously then, we will be focusing on getting the approvals that are necessary, closing the transaction and focusing on the integration of this business."

I am joined this morning by Kirk Andrews, our Chief Financial Officer. Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations. 
Before we begin, I would like to take a moment to say from everyone at NRG, we sincerely hope that you and your families are well and our thoughts are with those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It has never been clear how critical electricity is to our way of life. And now more than ever, our communities are relying on the service that we provide to homes and businesses. I want to thank our essential employees who are on the front lines safely operating our power plants and supporting our customers. These employees continue to impress me every day with their commitment and courage during this unprecedented time. 
Turning to Slide 3. I'd like to start by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's call: First, we initiated a comprehensive response to COVID-19, focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our #1 priority remains protecting the health and well-being of our employees, so they can safely deliver electricity and keep the lights on for our customers and communities; second, given the changes that we have made to our integrated business, we were able to deliver strong results during the first quarter and reaffirm our full year financial guidance; third, and as we promised on our February earnings call, we are providing enhanced disclosures on our business, including the introduction of new integrated regional segments. 
Turning to Slide 4. I want to talk to you in greater detail about our response to COVID-19. As you know, our top priority has been protecting the safety and wellbeing of our employees. On January 21, 1 day after the first confirmed U.S. case, we activated our Crisis Management Team to ensure we were prepared for any scenario. On March 17, we closed our offices and transition employees to remote work. We have remained fully operational during this time with over 95% of our office personnel working remotely. 
While we closed our offices to nonessential personnel, we also have employees who provide critical or essential services and continue to work at our power plants and in offices every day. As part of our commitment to protecting their health and safety, we introduced health screening guidelines for those continuing to work on-site, initiated deep cleaning protocols, enacted the strict social distancing guidelines, restricted access to offices and power plants, and implemented staggered staffing for essential functions. 
We have also expanded health benefits for all employees to include access to virtual doctors and awarded brands from our NRG employee relief fund. These additional resources are intended to protect our employees and their families. 
With respect to our operations, the impact has been limited. A few outages were delayed due to COVID-19 issues. However, none of them had a material financial impact or reliability implications. Our spring program included 84 outages and a nuclear refueling at STP, so we are well prepared for the summer months. 
We did stop work at all nonessential projects including our Encina demolition project in California. We have also paused face-to-face retail sales activities to support the safety and wellbeing of our team and communities. 
Recognizing that some of our customers have been financially impacted by COVID-19, we temporarily paused all late fees and electric disconnects, and offer deferred payment plans to provide temporary relief. We also work closely with the PUCT, another Texas market participants to create a solution that extends additional assistance through mid-July to low-income customers and those facing significant financial hardship as a result of COVID-19. 
In April, we announced a pledge of $2 million to relief efforts aimed at those on the front lines who needed the most. This includes funding and critical safety supplies to first responders who are in desperate need of personal protective equipment. Community-led relief funds for small businesses, which have been devastated as social distancing and shelter in place, guidelines have forced many to close for months and teachers and educators who play such a pivotal role in our communities where we live and work. We have begun activities to return our employees to the new normal operations, prioritizing their safety and wellbeing. 
Now moving on to our financial and operational results for the quarter on Slide 5. We achieved top decile safety performance and delivered $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, almost a 5% increase from the same period last year. These results were driven by the addition of stream energy and margin enhancement initiatives, partially offset by mild weather across our core markets. 
To put the mild weather into context, ERCOT and the Northeast saw temperatures that were 20% and 17% warmer than the 10-year normal for the first quarter. We're also reaffirming our full year guidance based on our expectations of a gradual reopening of our economy during the summer and the stability of our integrated platform. But these are unprecedented times and expect most of the adverse impact from COVID-19 to come from customer payment related items like bad debt. At this point, we estimate that to be around $50 million. We will look at offsetting this impact through prudent cost management and ERCOT's relief fund. 
During the quarter, we implemented our infectious disease and pandemic plan to ensure business continuity as we discussed in the previous slide. 
We also updated our reporting segments during the quarter, and are providing enhanced disclosures, which I will discuss in greater detail later in the presentation. These disclosures are intended to help you think about our business in the same way we manage it. I also believe they will help demonstrate the stability of our ERCOT platform that we have long talked about, but which was difficult to illustrate when Retail and Generation went up of as a separate businesses. 
Finally, on the last earnings call in late February, I spoke at length about our sustainability program and our commitment to transparency. To that end, we just published our 10th annual sustainability report. Our comprehensive sustainability framework is foundational to the long-term success of our company. One of the key metrics is the speed at which we are decarbonizing our business. As you will see, we are now 83% of the way to achieving our 2025 goal and have clear line of sight to get there. 
Moving to Slide 6. I want to highlight some of the impacts we are seeing on electric demand in our core markets. 
In the upper right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load for April. As you can see, electric demand has been impacted across the country with declines anywhere between 6% to 9%. Except in ERCOT, which continues to show resilience, and it is down only 2%. Even within ERCOT, we're seeing significant differences between West Texas and the rest of the state driven primarily by the impact of low oil prices in the Permian region. These differences are not only regional but also by customer class, as you can see in the lower right-hand side of the slide. Residential remain, which makes up around 30% of ERCOT peak electric demand this time of the year, is up 7% for the month of paper. While small business and C&I have been negatively impacted. 
The point I want to make here is that the impact to specific companies will depend on the customer mix in their portfolios. In our case, we are heavily weighted towards the Texas residential customer. 
Now looking ahead into the summer. Texas already began a partial reopening of the economy. This suggests that the severe impact to small businesses we have seen in April may ease as the economy reopens. Conversely, the impact on the Oil patch may just be getting started. I will simply remind everyone that our largest exposure in ERCOT is to residential demand, and so far, that has been robust. The impact to summer load is difficult to assess at this point. But I can tell you that summer prices will be dependent on wind production and weather. 
Finally, the long-term outlook for ERCOT from our perspective will remain robust. We know that reserve margins are dependent, almost exclusively on new renewables coming online in the next few years. No doubt, COVID-19 and low oil prices will have an impact on demand. It's difficult to know how much at this point. We have no new renewables PPA this quarter, which is indicative of a slowdown in new renewable development. How much these 2 things offset each other is going to determine scarcity prices going forward. 
Now based on where the forward curve is, not much scarcity is assuming the forward prices, which is not helpful for new renewable developments or any new development for that matter. This is why we think reserve margins will be tighter than what we have seen in the CDR. 
So with this market context, I want to review how we are positioned as a company to perform during this unprecedented period on Slide 7. Since I took over as CEO over 4 years ago, we deliberately evolved our business from a highly endeavored IPP to a more stable and predictable integrated power company. 
During this time, we simplify and streamline our portfolio, achieve what we view as an investment-grade balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework, and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While the stock price doesn't reflect it, we expect all the good work we have done to be reflected in our stable earnings, as we successfully navigate the current downtime. 
As you can see, we rebalanced our portfolio by selling noncore and underperforming assets to better match Retail Load with Generation. By integrating these 2 complementary and countercyclical parts of the value chain, we have significantly stabilized our earnings. 
As you can see in the new segments, our business is heavily weighted towards residential consumers, which has proven to be a more resilient group during this period, particularly in Texas. Second, our balance sheet has never been stronger. Last year, we reached our goal of driving our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our target investment-grade metric range of 2.5 to 2.75x, and through continued operational performance, we expect to drive this ratio to the conservative end of that range this year. We remain in close dialogue with the rating agencies, and we continue to target investment-grade ratings over the next 12 months. 
Our balance sheet strength goes well beyond these metrics. We have done a good job in managing our maturity schedule and liquidity. Our next maturity is not until 2024. And each year's maturity is sized to be less than any 1 year's free cash flow. Our liquidity also remained strong at approximately $2 billion. 
Next, on capital allocation, all our actions to stabilize and rightsize our business have created tremendous financial flexibility. And now with our deleveraging program behind us, we're focusing all our excess cash in 2020 and beyond on perfecting our business model and returning capital to our shareholders. Last year, we established a longer-term framework built upon a commitment of value creation through disciplined capital allocation across all cycles. With this financial flexibility, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic growth that meets our financial thresholds, and return capital to shareholders through growing our dividend to 7% to 9% combined with programmatic and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Finally, our comprehensive sustainability framework serves as a solid foundation to our portfolio as it is embedded in our culture, aligned with our strategy, and necessary for our long-term success. 
The bottom line is this, our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We recognize that our business model is unique and relatively new. 
I look forward to further validating the stability of our platform through our strong execution. 
Today, we're taking 1 additional step in the evolution of our business model, and how we report results. We have moved from having 2 distinct businesses, Retail, and Generation to 1 integrated business with a regional focus. Therefore, we need to realign our segment reporting to match our integrated strategy and the way we operate our company. 
Turning to Slide 8. We're introducing the new regional segments and EBITDA sensitivities. These segments will have the benefit of a common market structure, and importantly, we will better highlight the stability of our ERCOT platform. Also, the new sensitivities now captured the full impact of the integrated business at the EBITDA level. The Texas segment will include all activities in our value chain from customer operations to market and plant operations. In this new format, revenues will be primarily driven by Retail, while costs will be either the fuel that we buy for our power plants or the power we purchase from the wholesale market. This is exactly how we manage the business. The integration of these 2 countercyclical businesses results in long-term earnings stability from this segment, which is reinforced by the limited sensitivity to power prices shown in the bottom of the slide. 
The East segment will include all non-Texas customer activity and all Generation assets in the East. This region is not fully balanced between Retail and Generation. Therefore, we will continue to have both revenues and costs for each business. Our focus is to better match these 2 parts so we can fully integrate. 
The West and other segment includes the conventional and renewable projects in California, the Cottonwood lease, and our interest in one international asset. This segment will only have Generation revenue and cost since there is no ability to replicate our integrated model, due to a lack of competitive retail market. Because the East and West segments are not fully integrated, the sensitivity to changes in power prices are not optimized as it is in Texas. We believe this new segment structure better reflects our operations and regional impacts. 
So with that, I will turn it over to Kirk for the financial review."

I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2",1218,"Thank you, Mauricio. Starting on Slide 10. I'll provide a bit more detail on our new segment disclosures that Mauricio just reviewed. 
In 2020, we're aligning our reporting segments with our integrated operating model, which no longer involves managing 2 distinct lines of business, those being Retail and Generation. Our new segments reflect our integrated regional focus with our customer-facing business as a primary revenue driver and the majority of our Generation and associated costs, particularly in ERCOT, supporting our customer load. Our new segment financial results will provide a clear picture of the EBITDA produced by our integrated segments by geography and is consistent with the way we manage our business, 1 position for each market. 
To help you better understand our historical results in this context, at the top of the slide, we've translated our 2019 results into the new geographical segments as they will be reflected in the components of our guidance going forward. 
Specifically, the Texas segment includes all of our customer market and plant operations within ERCOT and we will be providing the expected contribution from this segment to our consolidated EBITDA guidance range going forward. We will also be providing the expected contribution to EBITDA guidance from the remaining reporting segments, which include East, West, and Corporate, and are comprised of the remainder of our businesses. 
On the upper right of the slide, you will find our 2019 results recast into these categories as compared to the corresponding results of our 2020 EBITDA guidance range. 
Later today, in addition to filing our 10-Q, we will also be filing an 8-K, which will contain restated financials based on our new segments on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 as well as annually for both 2017 and 2018 in order to further assist you in comparative analysis. You will find some of this information on Slide 21 in the appendix to today's presentation as well. 
The bottom half of the slide provides a bit more color on both the operations within each reporting segment as well as some highlights on the key components of the integrated margins within each. Focusing on Texas, you should be thinking of our revenue line as Retail revenue, while our cost to serve is comprised of both fuel costs associated with Generation, supporting our load and purchase power to support load in excess of economic generation. Going forward, Generation revenue in this segment will be minimal. 
In the East, our primary revenue will be from retail sales and capacity. And also include energy revenues from our plants that are not located near our load. The West is exclusively Generation, where our thermal assets in California and associated resource adequacy and energy revenue primarily comprising revenues on the income statement. While cost of goods sold will again primarily reflect fuel costs associated with those assets. 
The West segment also includes our interest in the 2 remaining utility-scale projects in California, those being Agua and Ivanpah, as well as our partial interest in our 1 remaining international generating plant in Australia. However, all 3 of these interests are accounted for under the equity method, and our share of the earnings will be reported on a single line in the income statement. 
Turning to the financial summary on Slide 11. NRG delivered $349 million in adjusted EBITDA and a robust $167 million in free cash flow before growth for the first quarter of 2020. Texas delivered $195 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $19 million increase versus 2019, largely due to the increase in load from the acquisition of Stream, which occurred in the second half of 2019, and improved margins due to the lower supply costs in Texas. 
The balance of our quarterly results of $154 million from East, West, and Corporate was in line overall with last year's results. However, within this, we did have a few items at note worth highlighting for comparative purposes. 
During 2019, we recognized a onetime gain of $27 million from the settlement of the mid-West Generation asbestos liability. During Q1 of 2020, due to the drop in oil prices, we wrote down our oil inventories in the East by $29 million, which is a noncash charge to earnings and EBITDA. Offsetting this write-down was the recognition in 2020 of $30 million in outage insurance proceeds related to outages that occurred last year. 
Finally, much improved availability of our Sunrise facility in the West and the lower cost of operations allowed our adjusted EBITDA outside of Texas to remain flat versus 2019. 
We saw no material impact from COVID-19 during the first quarter. However, as Mauricio mentioned earlier, over the balance of the year, we currently anticipate an impact of approximately $50 million due to the effects of the pandemic on customer payments, particularly bad debt expense, which we will look to offset through targeted cost management and the ERCOT relief fund. 
Moving to free cash flow before growth. During the first quarter of this year, we received the $60 million in cash flow items I highlighted for you last quarter, which contributed to robust free cash flow before growth of $167 million. Due to the Cares Act, we expect our free cash flow before growth [ over ] the balance of the year to further improve from the delay of approximately $17 million of FICA payments into '21 and '22, as well as the acceleration of $11 million of AMT refunds that were previously expected in later years. As Mauricio mentioned earlier, we continue to maintain strong liquidity of approximately $2 billion. 
However, as a precautionary measure and to ensure we maintain surplus cash on hand in the event of stress in the banking system, during the quarter, we drew down our revolving credit facility by approximately $550 million to proportionately increase cash on hand. As liquidity in financial markets has improved and we enter the more cash-generative time of the year, we expect to repay the revolver balance back to 0. And since the first quarter, we've already reduced that balance by more than half. 
Finally, turning to an update on share repurchase activity. To date, we have completed $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $33.05, which consists of $60 million in purchases, which was remaining balance of our 2019 program and $164 million of programmatic repurchases under our new capital allocation policy. 
Finally, turning to Slide 12 for a brief update on capital allocation activity. Our expectations for 2020 are unchanged, with the only item of note being the increase in share repurchases year-to-date, having now executed $164 million in share repurchases under the new capital allocation framework through the first 4 months of this year. We have now completed more than 40% of our targeted share repurchases as a part of our commitment to return 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders, which this year totaled $675 million, including our recently increased dividend. 
The balance of $614 million in remaining capital, shown in green on the right of the slide, remains available for accretive investment opportunities. 
However, should we be unable to find sufficient magnitude of strategically consistent value enhancing opportunities, we intend to allocate the balance of this unallocated capital to our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Mauricio."

But I would say the fact that both have maintained our positive outlook underscores their appreciation for our performance and our outlook as well as our balance sheet. 
And as Mauricio said, look, the current events provide an opportunity for us to prove the resilience of our platform under extreme positions, and that would provide us a further argument towards that upgrade. I mean that said, understanding in the near term, I think agencies are likely to take more prudent wait and see, if you will, approach to ratings upgrades. So it's reasonable for us to assume that that may extend the timeline a little bit, maybe 6 months forward. Certainly, that's not our objective or target, but I think we had to be reasonable about the pace given the circumstances we're in. But overall, based on our dialogue with the agencies, we're confident that with continued performance, investment-grade remains achievable at our current leverage level, which were in line with those targets."

Now as you go into the summer, just recognize that perhaps April, the increased demand is much bigger than what you're going to see in the summer months because in the summer months, you normally already have people using a lot of electricity. I mean, people -- kids are out of school, they come back to. So we don't expect to see the same level of impact as we go into this summer as we have seen in April. So yes, and also, it's going to depend on how quickly the economy comes back, right? I mean, small businesses, perhaps they open gradually, they're not going to open a full capacity at first.

Obviously, if you have a 6% increase or 7% increase on residential demand for the balance of the year, I mean, that's great for us because we have a pretty significant exposure to it if that's what you were trying to imply. But I also want to be cautious that there are so many things that we don't control here. We are, I think we are very well positioned. I think we're managing the -- our company and our risk well. But they are also mindful that there is a lot of things that are outside of our control, and we need to just monitor that assessment. And as we see it, we communicate that to you."

That fixed price short rolls in overtime, and we can flex and change price on that.

I'd like to start on Slide 2 by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. Our integrated platform performed well during the summer, delivering stable results despite challenging conditions presented by COVID-19. We're narrowing our 2020 guidance around the midpoint and maintaining our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance.
The Direct Energy transaction remains on track to close by year-end. And today, we're providing an update to our financing plan that no longer require new equity for the transaction. And we continue to advance our strategy to perfect our business model by optimizing our platform to better serve our customers.
Moving to our third quarter financial and operational results on Slide 3. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, we once again delivered top line safety performance. I want to take a moment to thank our employees, especially those who are on the front lines, reporting to power plants and dispatch centers for continuing to prioritize safety and for keeping the lights on for our customers throughout this pandemic.
During the quarter, we made good progress on our strategic priorities. The Direct Energy acquisition, which directly advances our strategy of moving closer to the customer is on track to close by year-end. We remain focused on perfecting our platform through portfolio optimization, which I will discuss later in the presentation. And we continue to refresh our Board of Directors with 5 new independent directors added over the last 3 years, making 2/3 of our Board now gender or ethnically diverse.
We also continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles, which will be highlighted throughout the presentation. Most notably is the updated financing plan for the Direct Energy acquisition and our commitment to investment-grade credit metrics.
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we delivered $752 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date results to $1.674 billion, a 5% increase from the same period last year. Drivers for our third quarter results include the impact from milder weather in Texas and COVID-19, offset by lower supply cost. Our strong year-to-date results allow us to narrow our 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance to the midpoint of the range, fully offset in the previously expected COVID-19 impacts.
For 2021, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance range, while updating our forecast to reflect more conservative expectations of COVID-19. At the moment, this puts us below the midpoint of our guidance, but we are focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on sales channels, primarily in the East and delays on the solar PPAs previously expected for summer '21. Kirk will address adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance in detail in his section.
Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide an update on the impact of COVID-19. At NRG, our top priority through this public health crisis have been the health and safety of our employees and customers. Beginning with employees, we activated our crisis management team one day after the first U.S. confirm case in January. We seamlessly transitioned over 90% of our office workforce to remote work, all while maintaining full operational status. For our customers, we have proactively expanded payment options to aid those negatively impacted by the pandemic. As we look forward, we recognized the need to rethink our work environment in a more permanent way to leverage technology and better meet the needs of an increasing hybrid society. This is why during the second quarter, we formed a tax force called [ Workplace '21 ] with the goal of redesigning our office workspace to create an optimal long-term work environment through and post COVID-19.
On the right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated the year-on-year weather-normalized changes in loads across ISOs. As you can see, electric demand continues to be impacted across the country, but is gradually recovering in all markets as states have entered various phases of reopening. ERCOT continues to display the most resilient, down just 1%. Within ERCOT, we continue to see significant variances in electric demand by customer type. Residential customers are still positive compared to normal. While commercial and industrial users remain negative, but all of them are showing signs of returning to normal levels.
For NRG, I want to remind everyone that the largest part of our portfolio in ERCOT is residential, which thus far has remained relatively resilient. As we have discussed, COVID-19 will continue to have an impact on customer demand, how we retain and grow customers and the time line for executing our renewable PPA strategy. As the pandemic persists, we're seeing new short-term challenges and longer-term opportunities.
First, on the electric and natural gas demand side, we continue to expect increased demand from residential customers given stay-a-home orders. This is clearly a net positive for us. Next, on how we retain and grow customers. We expect to be a relative winner given our best-in-class multichannel platform. In ERCOT, we're seeing lower attrition rates, which help stabilize customer count, but we're also seeing fewer customers looking to move away from competitors. We continue to redirect and refine marketing dollars. But for planning, we're assuming stable customer count in ERCOT. We could see incremental growth opportunities.
In the East, we're also realizing lower attrition, but giving less favorable regulatory framework, face-to-face is an important tool in creating awareness to win customers. While our non face-to-face channels are becoming increasingly effective, we believe our customer count will more closely track the overall economic reopening. For planning, we're assuming a contraction in customer count and as a second wave of potential shutdowns loan, we remain diligent in mitigating the impact if it were to occur.
COVID-19 continues to impact the time line of signed PPAs to achieve commercial operations. We now expect our pre-summer '21 solar PPAs to be delayed. This delay creates a headwind versus our midpoint of guidance because our load obligations will be met with more expensive market purchases. But they are value neutral given that we negotiated lower prices to accommodate for these delays.
To be clear, it is important to differentiate between the short-term impact of economic shutdowns and a socially distance economy versus what I believe is the stickiness of stay-at-home trends. As I stated before, I believe the former to be a near-term challenge that we will manage through and the latter to be a medium to long-term opportunity for competitive retail.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for a closer look at this past summer in ERCOT. On the top left chart, we show the cooling degree days by month.  The conditions through summer were mixed, with July and August slightly above normal, but with limited extreme heat events and September, well below normal due to an active hurricane season. This resulted in lower system-wide demand.
Now moving to the bottom left of the slide, you can see the impact on power prices year-over-year from lower demand than COVID-19, coupled with strong power plant performance. Our portfolio was fully hedged against price loan but on the margin, we were able to modestly lower our supply costs through opportunistic market purchases. Overall, the business performed well this summer. Our retail business mix continues to provide stability with stay-on-home trends, offsetting milder weather and impacts from COVID-19 on small and large C&I customers. We have now demonstrated the strength of our business over the past 3 summers under very different market conditions. 2018 saw volatile forwards with real -- with low realtime pricing.  2019 saw low forwards with high realtime pricing. And 2020 saw recessionary factors, including both low realtime pricing and customers in financial distress. This offer is just one more example of what underpins our confidence in the stability and predictability of our business model.
Moving to Slide 6 for an update on our ongoing efforts in perfecting our platform and the Direct Energy acquisition. As you know, over the last 4 years, we have been evolving our platform to be closer to the customer. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, achieved a strong balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While our stock price does not yet reflect the full measure of our success, we continue to strengthen and streamline our portfolio.
We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio by reducing generation and growing retail, but we're not done yet. To that effect, we expect to realize a minimum of $250 million in net equity proceeds, net of debt repayment associated with assets sold over the next 6 to 12 months. While we will not be providing details on the specific assets or businesses that we're targeting, you should expect a comprehensive update as outcomes are reached.
The first $200 million in proceeds will be used to fund Direct Energy with excess capital to be available for general capital allocation. Now moving to the right side of the slide. The Direct Energy acquisition remains on track to close by year-end. We received approval from Centrica shareholders, Canadian Competition Act and HSR. We're now awaiting approval from FERC, which is expected by year-end. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are achieving our equity needs through increased cash on hand and asset sale proceeds. This eliminates our need to go-to-market for new equity through the previously planned $750 million perpetual preferred equity-linked security. We believe this benefits both debt and equity investors, given it maintains a simplified capital structure as the preferred equity was a hybrid 50% equity and 50% debt instrument. Kirk will provide additional details on the financing point.
Importantly, our updated financing plan maintains our tap to achieve investment-grade metrics. Lastly, on integration. We are excited to close the acquisition and welcome Direct Energy employees into the NRG family. The integration process is well underway as our experience at cross-functional integration team is focused on day 1 activities and preparing for systems and process synergies. We look forward to bringing NRG's strength in risk management and customer experience with direct expanded platform of products and services to create value for customers and shareholders.
With that, I will pass it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,692141858,2130308,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. Turning to Slide 8 for a review of the third quarter results and 2020 guidance update. Year-to-date, NRG delivered $1.674 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from our",1390,"Thanks, Mauricio. Turning to Slide 8 for a review of the third quarter results and 2020 guidance update. Year-to-date, NRG delivered $1.674 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from our Texas segment was $1.087 billion, which was about $2 million higher from 2019, as we realize the contribution from the stream acquisition, which closed in the second half of 2019 and benefited from lower supply cost, which helped offset the year-to-date impact of COVID-19 from lower fees and lower C&I sales.
Outside Texas, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA increased by $79 million due to improved availability from our Sunrise plant in the West as it was in forced outage for a large part of 2019, increased resource adequacy payments as well as outage insurance received in 2020 for lost margin from outages incurred last year. Our third quarter results are $40 million lower than 2019, driven by milder weather, resulting in lower mass load, higher prices in 2019, which benefited our ERCOT generation portfolio and higher sales and marketing in 2020.
Moving to free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date cash flows are higher by $562 million versus 2019. This large increase is due in part to the receipt of approximately $60 million in cash flow items carried over from 2019 as well as some new initiatives focused on increasing our cash on hand to help fund the acquisition of Direct and eliminate the need for new equity issuance. For example, under the CARES Act, we elected to delay FICA payments and accelerated the receipt of AMT refunds that were previously expected beyond 2020. In addition, given our higher pension contributions in 2019 as well as planned asset depreciation, we've also deferred over $30 million of pension contributions into 2021.
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we're narrowing our 2020 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. And as a result of our efforts to accelerate cash to help fund the Direct acquisition, we are both narrowing and increasing our consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, representing a $125 million increase versus the midpoint of our prior guidance. As I mentioned earlier, a portion of this increase represents a pull forward of some of our 2021 cash flows, including both acceleration of cash inflows previously expected in 2021 as well as the deferral of certain cash outflows into 2021, which I'll address further in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a 2021 guidance update, we're maintaining our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion. And in order to adjust for the shift in cash flows from 2021 into 2020, we're reducing our 2021 free cash flow guidance to $1.20 billion to $1.4 billion. However, due to the potential lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our current outlook for 2021 places us in the bottom half of these ranges.
While we remain focused on managing the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the circumstances around the pandemic remain fluid and volatile. During the third quarter, NRG amended several of our renewable PPAs, as we were notified by our counterparties that due to delays in both financing and construction stemming from COVID, the projects are unable to meet their original commercial operations dates. Due to the extension of COD dates beyond '21, NRG no longer expects to realize the supply cost advantage associated with these PPAs during the summer of next year. In connection with the change in COD for the projects, NRG negotiated lower power prices and extended terms in order to recover the 2021 impact in future years.
Turning to Slide 10. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation. As shown on the left of the slide, 2020 capital available for allocation has increased by $155 million, as the result of our more robust 2020 free cash flow as well as the sale of the bulk of the remaining elements of our legacy distributed solar business, which is in the process of being finalized, and we expect to close later this quarter. After a minor increase in identified investments, largely resulting from the offsetting effect of an investment in our Astoria repowering project and a reduction in the deferral of Gen-on pension contributions. Our 2020 remaining excess capital has increased by over $150 million, putting the cash reserve for Direct Energy in excess of $800 million. Importantly, this increase is part of our revised plan to improve our financing mix for Direct by eliminating the need to issue new equity, which I'll review in greater detail on the next slide.
Turning then to our updated sources and uses for Direct, which you'll find on Slide 11. And starting with the original expected sources of capital we shared with you on our July 24 call, our plan to eliminate the need for $750 million in new equity-linked securities has 3 components. First, through the combination of increased 2020 cash and a reduction in financing costs associated with the elimination of equity issuance, we reduced our equity needs by $181 million.
Second, from a ratings perspective, half of the previously planned $750 million in convertible equity was treated as debt for ratings purposes, allowing us to increase the permanent debt financing for Direct on a ratings neutral basis. The final component necessary to complete new equity or just under $200 million will be an increase in new bonds. However, this element will be temporary as we intend to repay the same amount of our consolidated debt in 2021, using the net proceeds from noncore asset sales on the portfolio optimization initiative Mauricio discussed earlier. Net proceeds represents the amount of proceeds from these asset sales after giving effect for the repayment of debt at our target leverage ratio based on the EBITDA from assets sold. As you may recall, NRG has over $2 billion of callable debt in 2021, representing both our highest coupons and nearest maturities.
By issuing new lower-cost bonds and then subsequently repaying this legacy corporate debt, we create a more cost and maturity efficient way to achieve this debt reduction without relying on a traditional asset sale bridge. We are confident in our ability to generate at least this amount of excess capital from asset sales in order to return to our target credit metrics in 2021, which remains our capital allocation priority, as we are committed to maintaining these metrics as we continue to target investment-grade rating by late '21 or early 22.
Finally, as noted on the slide, we've made significant progress in increasing liquidity in connection with the transaction and are on track to completing the total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities prior to closing the acquisition. We also remain on track to issue the debt financing for Direct prior to the closing of the transaction as well.
Turning to 2021 capital allocation on Slide 12. To update the combined 2021 capital allocation provided on our July 24 call, we have adjusted the 2021 excess cash to reflect the reduction in the midpoint 2021 NRG free cash flow associated with that pull forward of cash flow into 2020. After giving effect for the $150 million increase in minimum cash following the Direct acquisition, this leads to just over $1.5 billion in 2021 capital available for allocation. Our expected 2021 dividend is unchanged and after giving effect for a modest increase in investments from the Astoria repowering project and a reserve for continued small retail book acquisitions, we continue to commit all remaining capital or approximately $950 million to debt reduction in order to achieve our objective of returning to our target metrics in 2021.
Finally, I'll turn to a brief update on those 2021 credit metrics, which you'll find on Slide 12. This is now based on our updated financing plan, which is shown in the middle column. After adjusting our pro forma corporate balance for debt reduction from 2021 capital allocation as well as the reduction in temporary debt using net proceeds from asset sales, our 2021 pro forma net debt balance is approximately $7.2 billion, which, based on the midpoint adjusted EBITDA implies a pro forma ratio of just over 2.7x net debt-to-EBITDA.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

Now taking just -- if you don't mind, I'd like to take just a little bit of a step back and start with your second question, so you understand better what we're doing here. When I think about perfecting the integrated model. What that means is growing our retail business, which we've done very successfully over the past 2 years, but also optimizing our generation assets and our service -- our portfolio of services to best meet the needs of our customers. That's the criteria that we're going to be using to evaluate our platform. And we -- I think everybody recognizes the capability that we have in commercial operations, that is a strength. We have the ability and the opportunity to evaluate given market conditions, whether we want to be owners of assets, whether we want to rent assets or if we want to partner with other service providers. I don't think there -- we need to always be thinking about vertically integrating and generating every single megawatt that we sell to our customers or every single service that we provided. And the best example that I can give you is our renewable PPA strategy. We added close to 1,600 megawatts very efficiently, add value. And we felt that, that was the best way to continue meeting the needs of our customers. And we're going to do the same on the services side. So hopefully, that provides you at least the general framework and some of the guidelines around how I think about value in terms of they have to be value-accretive and they have to be credit notion."

Well, I mean, if you think about Direct Energy, it is actually advances and accelerates that transformation to become more customer-focused and, I would say, almost a consumer service type of company. If you look at the Direct Energy acquisition, it doubled the size of our retail portfolio. We're now going to have a network of 6 million customers. Just think about that. So we need to be thinking -- what you're going to be hearing on the Analyst Day is how we're going to optimize that network of 6 million customers. In addition, not only we're just looking at electricity with the acquisition. We expanded the natural gas retail platform with Direct, which is one of the most recognized and best-in-class natural gas retail platforms. We enhanced also the products and services that we offer around the customer. And here, the goal is how do we create more stickiness? How do we, by combining the core offering that we have and sharing the common platform, retail platform, whether it is customer billing, invoicing, customer care, commercial operations, how do we create a multiplier that not only allows us to access greater margins, but makes them more stickier and makes our customers more loyal. I think you need to start thinking about lifetime value of customer, and we're going to be talking about on the Analyst Day. The second thing is it also helps us -- gives us the opportunity to achieve $300 million of synergies in this acquisition. And we have the team that has proven to achieve these kind of synergies, and we have done it over the last 3 years, and we're going to do it again over the next 3 years. So this is how we are setting up the company when I say customer focus. With that, we believe the value going forward, given the macro trends that we're seeing are moving closer to the customer and whoever owns that network of customers is going to have an opportunity to maximize it in a way that I believe hasn't been done in the energy space."

So those are a couple of the components of those headwinds. But again, returning far and away, I'd say the PPA delay is the biggest piece of that directional guidance, if you will."

So answering a specific to the PJM, and I would say the Northeast as a whole. With the acquisition of Direct Energy, we're able to rebalance or to much better balance our generation with our retail business. While I recognize that the Northeast is not Texas in terms of just the openness and competitiveness of the retail market. It's a good market, and it has the opportunity to get better and to improve. And I actually believe that it will happen for 2 things. One is the -- just a smart technology, the Internet of Things is going to empower customers a lot more than what they have been done. And with that comes more energy choice. And energy choice means more open and transparent competitive retail market. So I think the wind is -- it's on our backs on that. So and -- but having said that, there is something particular in the East, which is we can actually access multiple products and services. So we not only sell electricity, but we also sell natural gas, other products and services. So the margin opportunity in the East versus Texas, which Texas is more -- it's a bigger house footprint when it comes to electric consumption. The market is very open. In the East, we have the opportunity to sell these multiple products and services, which rivals the margin opportunity for us in Texas. Yes. Does that answer your question?

So we have a lot of market intelligence in terms of where these projects are, what are some of the economics where you can actually execute those projects. And quite candidly, some of the operational challenges. I mean, that's why we saw the delay here in 2021. We were talking about it. If you remember, a couple of earnings calls ago that there could be an impact of COVID-19 in these projects. Now we're seeing it. Fortune, I mean, we were very keen on these. This is value neutral because, I mean, we wanted to provide this flexibility for developers, and these are very well-known developers. But we wanted to make sure that we did it at value neutral. So I mean, my take is that renewables are going to continue to be the marginal megawatt developed in the country as a whole. I think it's fair to say that smart technologies and clean energy will continue to grow in the coming years. And I think we're really well positioned for what that means to the electric grid. On one hand, we -- given the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to access some of these renewables, a very attractive economics for a turn that is better for our retail business. And on the other hand, if that impacts the prices, then we have an opportunity to access that through lower supply costs. So I'm very, very comfortable where we are.

Also on the call and available for questions, we have Elizabeth Killinger, our Head of Retail Mass; and Chris Moser, Head of Operations.
I'd like to start on Slide 2 by highlighting the 3 key messages for today's presentation. Our integrated platform performed well during the summer, delivering stable results despite challenging conditions presented by COVID-19. We're narrowing our 2020 guidance around the midpoint and maintaining our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance.
The Direct Energy transaction remains on track to close by year-end. And today, we're providing an update to our financing plan that no longer require new equity for the transaction. And we continue to advance our strategy to perfect our business model by optimizing our platform to better serve our customers.
Moving to our third quarter financial and operational results on Slide 3. Beginning on the left-hand side of the slide, we once again delivered top line safety performance. I want to take a moment to thank our employees, especially those who are on the front lines, reporting to power plants and dispatch centers for continuing to prioritize safety and for keeping the lights on for our customers throughout this pandemic.
During the quarter, we made good progress on our strategic priorities. The Direct Energy acquisition, which directly advances our strategy of moving closer to the customer is on track to close by year-end. We remain focused on perfecting our platform through portfolio optimization, which I will discuss later in the presentation. And we continue to refresh our Board of Directors with 5 new independent directors added over the last 3 years, making 2/3 of our Board now gender or ethnically diverse.
We also continue to adhere to our capital allocation principles, which will be highlighted throughout the presentation. Most notably is the updated financing plan for the Direct Energy acquisition and our commitment to investment-grade credit metrics.
Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we delivered $752 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date results to $1.674 billion, a 5% increase from the same period last year. Drivers for our third quarter results include the impact from milder weather in Texas and COVID-19, offset by lower supply cost. Our strong year-to-date results allow us to narrow our 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance to the midpoint of the range, fully offset in the previously expected COVID-19 impacts.
For 2021, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDA guidance range, while updating our forecast to reflect more conservative expectations of COVID-19. At the moment, this puts us below the midpoint of our guidance, but we are focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on sales channels, primarily in the East and delays on the solar PPAs previously expected for summer '21. Kirk will address adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance in detail in his section.
Turning to Slide 4. I want to provide an update on the impact of COVID-19. At NRG, our top priority through this public health crisis have been the health and safety of our employees and customers. Beginning with employees, we activated our crisis management team one day after the first U.S. confirmed case in January. We seamlessly transitioned over 90% of our office workforce to remote work, all while maintaining full operational status. For our customers, we have proactively expanded payment options to aid those negatively impacted by the pandemic. As we look forward, we recognized the need to rethink our work environment in a more permanent way to leverage technology and better meet the needs of an increasing hybrid society. This is why during the second quarter, we formed a task force called Workplace 21 with the goal of redesigning our office workspace to create an optimal long-term work environment through and post COVID-19.
On the right-hand side of the slide, we have estimated the year-on-year weather-normalized changes in load across ISOs. As you can see, electric demand continues to be impacted across the country, but is gradually recovering in all markets as states have entered various phases of reopening. ERCOT continues to display the most resilience, down just 1%. Within ERCOT, we continue to see significant variances in electric demand by customer type. Residential customers are still positive compared to normal while commercial and industrial users remain negative. But all of them are showing signs of returning to normal levels. For NRG, I want to remind everyone that the largest part of our portfolio in ERCOT is residential, which, thus far, has remained relatively resilient. 
As we have discussed, COVID-19 will continue to have an impact on customer demand, how we retain and grow customers and the time line for executing our renewable PPA strategy. As the pandemic persists, we're seeing new short-term challenges and longer-term opportunities.
First, on the electric and natural gas demand side, we continue to expect increased demand from residential customers given stay-at-home orders. This is clearly a net positive for us. Next, on how we retain and grow customers. We expect to be a relative winner given our best-in-class multichannel platform. In ERCOT, we're seeing lower attrition rates, which help stabilize customer count, but we're also seeing fewer customers looking to move away from competitors. We continue to redirect and refine marketing dollars. But for planning, we're assuming stable customer count in ERCOT. We could see incremental growth opportunities.
In the East, we're also realizing lower attrition, but giving less favorable regulatory framework, face-to-face is an important tool in creating awareness to win customers. While our non face-to-face channels are becoming increasingly effective, we believe our customer count will more closely track the overall economic reopening. For planning, we're assuming a contraction in customer count and as a second wave of potential shutdowns roam, we remain diligent in mitigating the impact if it were to occur.
COVID-19 continues to impact the time line of signed PPAs to achieve commercial operations. We now expect our pre-summer '21 solar PPAs to be delayed. This delay creates a headwind versus our midpoint of guidance because our load obligations will be met with more expensive market purchases. But they are value neutral given that we negotiated lower prices to accommodate for these delays.
To be clear, it is important to differentiate between the short-term impact of economic shutdowns and a socially distanced economy versus what I believe is the stickiness of stay-at-home trends. As I stated before, I believe the former to be a near-term challenge that we will manage through and the latter to be a medium- to long-term opportunity for competitive retail.
Now let's move to Slide 5 for a closer look at this past summer in ERCOT. On the top left chart, we show the cooling degree days by month. The conditions through summer were mixed, with July and August slightly above normal, but with limited extreme heat events. And September, well below normal due to an active hurricane season. This resulted in lower system-wide demand.
Now moving to the bottom left of the slide, you can see the impact on power prices year-over-year from lower demand and COVID-19, coupled with strong power plant performance. Our portfolio was fully hedged against price load but on the margin, we were able to modestly lower our supply cost through opportunistic market purchases. Overall, the business performed well this summer. Our retail business mix continues to provide stability with stay-at-home trends, offsetting milder weather and impacts from COVID-19 on small and large C&I customers. We have now demonstrated the strength of our business over the past 3 summers under very different market conditions. 2018 saw volatile forwards with real -- with low realtime pricing. 2019 saw low forwards with high realtime pricing. And 2020 saw recessionary factors, including both low-realtime pricing and customers in financial distress. This offer is just one more example of what underpins our confidence in the stability and predictability of our business model.
Moving to Slide 6 for an update on our ongoing efforts in perfecting our platform and the Direct Energy acquisition. As you know, over the last 4 years, we have been evolving our platform to be closer to the customer. During this time, we simplified and streamlined our portfolio, achieved a strong balance sheet, establish a transparent and compelling capital allocation framework and made sustainability an integral part of our foundation. While our stock price does not yet reflect the full measure of our success, we continue to strengthen and streamline our portfolio.
We have significantly rebalanced our portfolio by reducing generation and growing retail, but we're not done yet. To that effect, we expect to realize a minimum of $250 million in net equity proceeds, net of debt repayment associated with assets sold over the next 6 to 12 months. While we will not be providing details on the specific assets or businesses that we're targeting, you should expect a comprehensive update as outcomes are reached.
The first $200 million in proceeds will be used to fund Direct Energy with excess capital to be available for general capital allocation. Now moving to the right side of the slide. The Direct Energy acquisition remains on track to close by year-end. We received approval from Centrica shareholders, Canadian Competition Act and HSR. We're now awaiting approval from FERC, which is expected by year-end. 
As I mentioned in my remarks, we are achieving our equity needs through increased cash on hand and asset sale proceeds. This eliminates our need to go-to-market for new equity through the previously planned $750 million perpetual preferred equity-linked security. We believe this benefits both debt and equity investors, given it maintains a simplified capital structure as the preferred equity was a hybrid, 50% equity and 50% debt instrument. Kirk will provide additional details on the financing point.
Importantly, our updated financing plan maintains our cap to achieve investment-grade metrics. Lastly, on integration. We are excited to close the acquisition and welcome Direct Energy employees into the NRG family. The integration process is well underway as our experience at cross-functional integration team is focused on day 1 activities and preparing for systems and process synergies. 
We look forward to bringing NRG's strength in risk management and customer experience with direct expanded platform of products and services to create value for customers and shareholders.
With that, I will pass it over to Kirk for the financial review."
413857,692141858,2130835,"NRG Energy, Inc., Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2020",2020-11-05,"Earnings Calls","NRG Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mauricio. Turning to Slide 8 for a review of the third quarter results and 2020 guidance update. Year-to-date, NRG delivered $1.674 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from our",1390,"Thanks, Mauricio. Turning to Slide 8 for a review of the third quarter results and 2020 guidance update. Year-to-date, NRG delivered $1.674 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.2 billion in free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from our Texas segment was $1.087 billion, which was about $2 million higher from 2019, as we realized the contribution from the Stream acquisition, which closed in the second half of 2019 and benefited from lower supply cost, which helped offset the year-to-date impact of COVID-19 from lower fees and lower C&I sales.
Outside Texas, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA increased by $79 million due to improved availability from our Sunrise plant in the West as it was in forced outage for a large part of 2019, increased resource adequacy payments as well as outage insurance received in 2020 for lost margin from outages incurred last year. Our third quarter results are $40 million lower than 2019, driven by milder weather, resulting in lower mass load, higher prices in 2019, which benefited our ERCOT generation portfolio and higher sales and marketing from 2020.
Moving to free cash flow before growth. Year-to-date cash flows are higher by $562 million versus 2019. This large increase is due in part to the receipt of approximately $60 million in cash flow items carried over from 2019 as well as some new initiatives focused on increasing our cash on hand to help fund the acquisition of Direct and eliminate the need for new equity issuance. For example, under the CARES Act, we elected to delay FICA payments and accelerated the receipt of AMT refunds that were previously expected beyond 2020. 
In addition, given our higher pension contributions in 2019 as well as planned asset depreciation, we've also deferred over $30 million of pension contributions into 2021.
Finally, as Mauricio mentioned in his opening remarks, we're narrowing our 2020 consolidated adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. And as a result of our efforts to accelerate cash to help fund the Direct acquisition, we are both narrowing and increasing our consolidated free cash flow before growth guidance to $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, representing a $125 million increase versus the midpoint of our prior guidance. As I mentioned earlier, a portion of this increase represents a pull forward of some of our 2021 cash flows, including both acceleration of cash inflows previously expected in 2021 as well as the deferral of certain cash outflows into 2021, which I'll address further in a few moments. 
Turning to Slide 9 for a 2021 guidance update, we're maintaining our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.90 billion to $2.1 billion. And in order to adjust for this shift in cash flows from 2021 into 2020, we're reducing our 2021 free cash flow guidance to $1.20 billion to $1.4 billion. However, due to the potential lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, our current outlook for 2021 places us in the bottom half of these ranges.
While we remain focused on managing the impacts of COVID-19 on our business, the circumstances around the pandemic remain fluid and volatile. During the third quarter, NRG amended several of our renewable PPAs, as we were notified by our counterparties that due to delays in both financing and construction stemming from COVID, the projects are unable to meet their original commercial operations dates. Due to the extension of COD dates beyond '21, NRG no longer expects to realize the supply cost advantage associated with these PPAs during the summer of next year. In connection with the change in COD for the projects, NRG negotiated lower power prices and extended terms in order to recover the 2021 impact in future years.
Turning to Slide 10. To complete the 2020 update, I'll briefly review 2020 capital allocation. As shown on the left of the slide, 2020 capital available for allocation has increased by $155 million, as the result of our more robust 2020 free cash flow as well as the sale of the bulk of the remaining elements of our legacy distributed solar business, which is in the process of being finalized and we expect to close later this quarter. After a minor increase in identified investments, largely resulting from the offsetting effect of an investment in our Astoria repowering project and a reduction in the deferral of GenOn pension contributions. Our 2020 remaining excess capital has increased by over $150 million, putting the cash reserve for Direct Energy in excess of $800 million. Importantly, this increase is part of our revised plan to improve our financing mix for Direct by eliminating the need to issue new equity, which I'll review in greater detail on the next slide.
Turning then to our updated sources and uses for Direct, which you'll find on Slide 11. And starting with the original expected sources of capital we shared with you on our July 24 call. Our plan to eliminate the need for $750 million in new equity-linked securities has 3 components. First, through the combination of increased 2020 cash and a reduction in financing costs associated with the elimination of equity issuance, we reduced our equity needs by $181 million.
Second, from a ratings perspective, half of the previously planned $750 million in convertible equity was treated as debt for ratings purposes, allowing us to increase the permanent debt financing for Direct on a ratings neutral basis. The final component necessary to complete new equity or just under $200 million will be an increase in new bonds. However, this element will be temporary as we intend to repay the same amount of our consolidated debt in 2021, using the net proceeds from noncore asset sales on the portfolio optimization initiative, Mauricio discussed earlier. Net proceeds represents the amount of proceeds from these asset sales after giving effect for the repayment of debt at our target leverage ratio based on the EBITDA from assets sold. 
As you may recall, NRG has over $2 billion of callable debt in 2021, representing both our highest coupons and nearest maturities. By issuing new lower-cost bonds and then subsequently repaying this legacy corporate debt, we create a more cost and maturity efficient way to achieve this debt reduction without relying on a traditional asset sale bridge. We are confident in our ability to generate at least this amount of excess capital from asset sales in order to return to our target credit metrics in 2021, which remains our capital allocation priority, as we are committed to maintaining these metrics as we continue to target investment-grade rating by late '21 or early 22.
Finally, as noted on the slide, we've made significant progress in increasing liquidity in connection with the transaction and are on track to completing the total of $3.5 billion in additional facilities prior to closing the acquisition. We also remain on track to issue the debt financing for Direct prior to the closing of the transaction as well.
Turning to 2021 capital allocation on Slide 12. To update the combined 2021 capital allocation provided on our July 24 call, we have adjusted the 2021 excess cash to reflect the reduction in the midpoint 2021 NRG free cash flow associated with that pull forward of cash flow into 2020. After giving effect for the $150 million increase in minimum cash following the Direct acquisition, this leads to just over $1.5 billion in 2021 capital available for allocation. Our expected 2021 dividend is unchanged and after giving effect for a modest increase in investments from the Astoria repowering project and a reserve for continued small retail book acquisitions, we continue to commit all remaining capital or approximately $950 million to debt reduction in order to achieve our objective of returning to our target metrics in 2021.
Finally, I'll turn to a brief update on those 2021 credit metrics, which you'll find on Slide 12. This is now based on our updated financing plan, which is shown in the middle column. After adjusting our pro forma corporate balance for debt reduction from 2021 capital allocation as well as the reduction in temporary debt using net proceeds from asset sales, our 2021 pro forma net debt balance is approximately $7.2 billion, which, based on the midpoint adjusted EBITDA implies a pro forma ratio of just over 2.7x net debt-to-EBITDA.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Mauricio."

That's going to be the overarching goal and framework. Now taking just -- if you don't mind, I'd like to take just a little bit of a step back and start with your second question, so you understand better what we're doing here. When I think about perfecting the integrated model. What that means is growing our retail business, which we've done very successfully over the past 2 years, but also optimizing our generation assets and our service -- our portfolio of services to best meet the needs of our customers. That's the criteria that we're going to be using to evaluate our platform. And we -- I think everybody recognizes the capability that we have in commercial operations. That is a strength. 
We have the ability and the opportunity to evaluate given market conditions, whether we want to be owners of assets, whether we want to rent assets or if we want to partner with other service providers. I don't think there -- we need to always be thinking about vertically integrating and generating every single megawatt that we sell to our customers or every single service that we provide. And the best example that I can give you is our renewable PPA strategy. We added close to 1,600 megawatts very efficiently, add value. And we felt that, that was the best way to continue meeting the needs of our customers. And we're going to do the same on the services side. So hopefully, that provides you at least the general framework and some of the guidelines around how I think about value in terms of they have to be value-accretive and they have to be credit notion."

Well, I mean, if you think about Direct Energy, it is actually advances and accelerates that transformation to become more customer-focused and, I would say, almost a consumer service type of company. If you look at the Direct Energy acquisition, it doubled the size of our retail portfolio. We're now going to have a network of 6 million customers. Just think about that. So we need to be thinking -- what you're going to be hearing on the Analyst Day is how we're going to optimize that network of 6 million customers. In addition, not only we're just looking at electricity with the acquisition. We expanded the natural gas retail platform with Direct, which is one of the most recognized and best-in-class natural gas retail platforms. We enhanced also the products and services that we offer around the customer. And here, the goal is how do we create more stickiness? How do we -- by combining the core offering that we have and sharing the common platform, retail platform, whether it is customer billing, invoicing, customer care, commercial operations, how do we create a multiplier that not only allows us to access greater margins, but makes them more stickier and makes our customers more loyal. I think you need to start thinking about lifetime value of customer, and we're going to be talking about on the Analyst Day. The second thing is it also helps us -- gives us the opportunity to achieve $300 million of synergies in this acquisition. And we have the team that has proven to achieve these kind of synergies, and we have done it over the last 3 years, and we're going to do it again over the next 3 years. So this is how we are setting up the company when I say customer-focused. We believe that value going forward, given the macro trends that we're seeing, are moving closer to the customer and whoever owns that network of customers is going to have an opportunity to maximize it in a way that I believe hasn't been done in the energy space."

We're already focused in mitigating the impact for 2021. And -- but obviously, it depends also on COVID-19 as a whole. How long is the pandemic going to last? What is the impact that it's going to have on our sales channel. But I believe that we have been conservative on our assumptions. And if it lasts longer, it will have an impact.

The delay in the PPAs that both Mauricio and I talked about, I call that the primary driver for that directional guidance. The balance of the potential headwinds or the possibilities of COVID across the Board. I'd call it -- I even mentioned this, selling and marketing costs was one element of that to reinstate or reinforce our sales channels, either by enhancing digital. If we find ourselves in a position that we can't return to a robust face-to-face environment from a selling standpoint or just ultimately return to a regular clip and maybe in the near term, more robust on face-to-face selling and marketing to continue to drive customer growth, in particular in the East, which has probably been disproportionately impacted by the lack of the ability to sell face-to-face. So those are a couple of the components of those headwinds. But again, returning far and away, I'd say the PPA delay is the biggest piece of that directional guidance, if you will."

So answering a specific to the PJM, and I would say the Northeast as a whole. With the acquisition of Direct Energy, we're able to rebalance or to much better balance our generation with our retail business. While I recognize that the Northeast is not Texas in terms of just the openness and competitiveness of the retail market. It's a good market, and it has the opportunity to get better and to improve. And I actually believe that it will happen for 2 things. One is the -- just a smart technology, the Internet of Things is going to empower customers a lot more than what they have been doing. And with that comes more energy choice. And energy choice means more open and transparent competitive retail market. So I think the wind is beating at least on your -- it's on our backs on that. So -- and -- but having said that, there is something particular in the East, which is we can actually access multiple products and services. So we not only sell electricity, but we also sell natural gas, other products and services. So the margin opportunity in the East versus Texas, which Texas is more -- it's a bigger house footprint when it comes to electric consumption. The market is very open. In the East, we have the opportunity to sell these multiple products and services, which rivals the margin opportunity for us in Texas. 
Yes. Does that answer your question? I know that you had also another one on capacity. Did I hear that correctly?"

We were a lot longer generation than retail that we're now a lot more balanced. But as I said previously, our goal is to continue to optimize our generation portfolio and our services portfolio to best meet the needs of our customers. That's the overarching criteria that we're going to be using. And as I mentioned, I mean, we're going to continuously look at the makeup of our generation portfolio to see do we have the right mix, given where our customers are? And if not, then we're going to be very aggressively changing that make up. 
And I think one thing that is important is, we don't have to own every single megawatt. And I think that's critical. We have a commercial operations capability that is second to none in the industry that allows us to either rent through PPAs or tolling agreements, access the market opportunistically, own a generation. And that's what we're going to be -- we're going to be doing continuously. This is not just a -- it happens now and it stops. We're going to continuously optimize our portfolio."

But now on the contracting side as opposed to the developing renewables, of contracting renewables. So we have a lot of market intelligence in terms of where these projects are, what are some of the economics where you can actually execute those projects. And quite candidly, some of the operational challenges. I mean, that's why we saw the delay here in 2021. We were talking about it. If you remember, a couple of earnings calls ago that there could be an impact of COVID-19 in these projects. Now we're seeing it. Fortune, I mean, we were very keen on these. This is value neutral because, I mean, we wanted to provide this flexibility for developers, and these are very well-known developers. 
But we wanted to make sure that we did it at value neutral. So I mean, my take is that renewables are going to continue to be the marginal megawatt developed in the country as a whole. I think it's fair to say that smart technologies and clean energy will continue to grow in the coming years. And I think we're really well positioned for what that means to the electric grid. On one hand, we -- given the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to access some of these renewables, a very attractive economics for a turn that is better for our retail business. And the thing on the other hand, if that impacts the prices, then we have an opportunity to access that through lower supply costs. So I'm very, very comfortable where we are.

And the only thing I'd add on the financing side, and I think we've talked about this before in various conversations. I mean we've seen a little bit of a pullback or a tightening around the tax equity market, a little bit more scarcity around that. Obviously, that's going to impact the cost of financing, which in turn attracts the appetite for PPAs. And if that headwind or that governor, if you will, that drives the PPA appetite up. That doesn't change our discipline around where we see value in pricing new PPAs relative to where the market is at the end of the day. But I think that in addition to Mauricio's comments sort of, kind of, gives us a little bit of a pacer, if you will, for the pace of newbuild at least as far as renewables are concerned in terms of the less liquid aspect of that market because some of the banks kind of pulled back a little bit from a tax equity perspective."
