We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis, and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. 
Employee health and safety, the core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators and hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. 
Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. 
Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying case by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. While the currently harvested areas are India and certain countries in Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures. North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. 
Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business, where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round the clock service at hospitals across the globe. In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the harvested verticals and with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. 
Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. 
Across our business, we have responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. 
This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers and hospitals. 
In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer local communities in many ways. 
As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection, and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts we signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. 
In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. 
Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. 
I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Good morning, everyone. Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures",1738,"Thank you, Judy. Good morning, everyone. Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and under absorption of costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as a $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas, mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits, excluding China, and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and nonKong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. 
We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world, with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter with growth in Americas and EMEA, offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. 
New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remains strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5%, with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3% with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. 
As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives, driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8 with the new equipment orders and factory shipments, both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. 
We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. 
Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trends into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and are waiting stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. 
Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. In EMEA, the significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., Basel, Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued -- is expected to be down high single digits to 10% with the high end of the range, reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown on measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. 
In the service segment, our contractual  maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. We and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance of repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic incremental under absorption of costs, higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. As spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and returned $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new groupment -- the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small -- slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good starts to the year. 
In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And same thing even in China, where the markets were down. We were -- our book margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. 
And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1, and we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. 
Having said that, I mean the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And -- but these are temporary concessions, and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. 
Also, most customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we address each one of them individually. 
But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, they have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we assumed some impact and especially at the higher end of the range. And same on our new equipment, we've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we are talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of kind of guided to. 
Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There's not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year."

And we are taking incremental actions in early 2021 to maybe take some of our dollar-denominated debt and convert that into euro-denominated debt. So we're taking incremental actions.

So it's early days to see where -- when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that."

Maybe just help us understand that free cash flow pressure in the first quarter and how quickly the free cash flow recovers. And also, I guess, I was a bit confused, because if I look at the material, I think you have about $975 million of free cash flow guide at the midpoint. I guess, excluding NCI, about $890 million of adjusted net income at the midpoint. So it's maybe about 110% conversion on adjusted net. But I think the conversion you present is versus GAAP net income. So just wanted to check that. And does that mean that GAAP net income and adjusted net income are broadly similar for the year even with that big delta in Q1?"

Let me -- yes, let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 through Q4, and that was primarily due to the s",604,"Yes. Let me -- yes, let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 through Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in her prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So -- and part of this decline was to support getting a supply chain up and ready in China. And this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally, given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China, given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation cost. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment. 
Now what you will see -- and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China, Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then -- so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done -- we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean, if you look at the guide to guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower Capex. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash, that's kind of the midpoint. So we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. 
Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian, it is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to include some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that you have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken and the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any non cash onetimers, like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash challenges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range of 110 to 120 million. And as adjusted net income, which will speak to that's at 110% at the midpoint."

We -- and if you see our restructuring numbers are up that $70 million to $80 million, we spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions as you would expect us to. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals.

And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether -- how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back.

And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall, we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. 
The 2 biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side, but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain -- we have 40,000 service -- field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that working with our workers' councils, our unions that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. 
So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis 1 IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers.

So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we -- overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some under absorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we are seeing this year, especially on the service side, because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of under absorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket, it's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from under absorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and that you see some of that on the -- in the green bucket.

We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. 
Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. 
Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures. 
 
North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. 
Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business, where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. 
In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. 
Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. 
Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. 
This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. 
And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. 
As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. 
In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. 
Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. 
I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. 
New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. 
We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. 
Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. 
New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. 
As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. 
We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. 
Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. 
Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. 
In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued -- is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. 
In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment -- the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small -- slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing -- even in China, where the markets were down, we were -- our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. 
And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And -- but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. 
Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and -- even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. 
But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and -- which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and -- especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year."

And the improvement that you're seeing between Investor Day and now is coming from reduction in the taxes that we have to pay on repatriation of cash. If you recall at Investor Day, we had mentioned that we had about 2 to 3 points of tax headwind because we needed to pay tax when we repatriate cash into the U.S. And that, we've been able to work on certain projects to reduce that, and we are taking incremental actions in early 2021 to maybe take some of our dollar-denominated debt and convert that into euro-denominated debt. So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions. We'll keep updating you as we learn more, but we are in early stages. But I'm confident that rate is going to come down over time."

That's really where the strength has been coming from and the usage has been coming from that we've been seeing the demand as well on repair is in the residential segment. Other than that, we really don't break these out below that. But as you can imagine, we are talking to a lot of customers as they do rebound and more importantly, reopen and come off pause as to how they want their buildings to be utilized, especially in the office and commercial space, whether that's malls or more importantly, office buildings. So we've got lots of requests to help with limited spacing. We've gotten helps -- requests to help with additional products. But I think what it does is it reinforces our Compass product, our destination dispatch product, which does allow touch-free utilization as well as improved utilization of elevators. So it's early days to see where -- when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that."

Maybe just help us understand that free cash flow pressure in the first quarter and how quickly the free cash flow recovers. And also, I guess, I was a bit confused, because if I look at the material, I think you have about $975 million of free cash flow guide at the midpoint. I guess excluding NCI, about $890 million of adjusted net income at the midpoint. So it's maybe about a 110% conversion on adjusted net. But I think the conversion you present is versus GAAP net income. So just wanted to check that. And does that mean that GAAP net income and adjusted net income are broadly similar for the year even with that big delta in Q1?"

Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation.

So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 through Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So -- and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment.
Now what you will see -- and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China -- Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then -- so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done -- we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower Capex. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's -- we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. 
Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to -- includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that you'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken -- the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint."

We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us do. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals.

And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether -- how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back.

We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. 
The 2 biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain -- we have 40,000 service -- field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. 
So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue.

So it doesn't matter whether it's the last one or the first one. So in terms -- so if you look at our disclosures that we have made, our contribution margin on new equipment averages between, depending on the quarter, about 17% to 18%, right? So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we -- overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the -- in the green bucket. As we spoke about, we have taken actions wherever we could to reduce the underabsorption through -- whether it's through restructuring actions or through furlough. So we are taking actions to reduce the underabsorption. So we kind of -- one is on the left, the other one is in the middle of the page. So that's what that is. So overall, you should think about 25% of our contribution margin plus an additional impact from underabsorption."

We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. 
Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. 
Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new [ equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in ] Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures. 
 
North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. 
Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. 
In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. 
Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. 
Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. 
This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. 
And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. 
As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. 
In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. 
Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. 
I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. 
New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. 
We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. 
Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. 
New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. 
As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. 
We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. 
Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. 
Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. 
In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued -- is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. 
In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

And I want to close by reminding you of the strong fundamentals behind this fantastic business. This is truly an iconic brand in this large industry, where we have been the leader. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain and new equipment to continue to expand on our leading 2 million unit service portfolio, the heart of our recurring business model, where we'll continue to focus on margin expansion through productivity. And in these difficult times, we're going to continue to invest for growth, maintaining a sustainable level of R&D and capital expenditures to ensure that when we all return to our normal lives, we are still at the forefront of technology, driving digital innovations, providing new solutions for our customers and empowering our field professionals with tools to make them more effective. You have our commitment that we'll use our robust cash generation in excess of 100% of net income to create shareholder value, and you saw that with our dividend announcement yesterday.

I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment -- the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small -- slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing -- even in China, where the markets were down, we were -- our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. 
And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And -- but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. 
Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like at our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and -- even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. 
But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and -- which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and -- especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year."

If you recall at Investor Day, we had mentioned that we had about 2 to 3 points of tax headwind because we needed to pay tax when we repatriate cash into the U.S. And that, we've been able to work on certain projects to reduce that, and we are taking incremental actions in early 2021 to maybe take some of our dollar-denominated debt and convert that into euro-denominated debt. So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions. We'll keep updating you as we learn more, but we are in early stages. But I'm confident that rate is going to come down over time."

Other than that, we really don't break these out below that. But as you can imagine, we are talking to a lot of customers as they do rebound and more importantly, reopen and come off pause as to how they want their buildings to be utilized, especially in the office and commercial space, whether that's malls or more importantly, office buildings. So we've got lots of requests to help with limited spacing. We've gotten helps -- requests to help with additional products. But I think what it does is it reinforces our Compass product, our destination dispatch product, which does allow touch-free utilization as well as improved utilization of elevators. So it's early days to see where -- when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that."

But I think the conversion you present is versus GAAP net income. So just wanted to check that.

Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 to Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin.",605,"Yes. Let me -- yes. Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 to Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So -- and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment.
Now what you will see -- and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China -- Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then -- so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done -- we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower CapEx. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's -- we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. 
Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to -- includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that we'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken -- the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint."

And so we're really seeing the construction part of the new -- which is the main element of new equipment, obviously, other than the manufacturing is the installation and construction piece. It's that speed of recovery that we're trying to watch and calibrate and monitor for 2Q."

We -- and if you see our restructuring numbers, we upped that to $70 million to $80 million. We spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us to. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals. That includes furloughs and executive pay reductions, all the things that you would expect us to do. And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether -- how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back. And our goal will be to ensure that we take enough structural cost out to mitigate the impact of any onetime headwind that we will get from these actions that we're taking."

We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. 
The 2 biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain -- we have 40,000 service -- field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. 
So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue. And once we get through those, we see service having the potential to accelerate."

So it doesn't matter whether it's the last one or the first one. So in terms -- so if you look at our disclosures that we have made, our contribution margin on new equipment averages between, depending on the quarter, about 17% to 18%, right? So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we -- overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out to about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the -- in the green bucket. As we spoke about, we have taken actions wherever we could to reduce the underabsorption through -- whether it's through restructuring actions or through furlough. So we are taking actions to reduce the underabsorption. So we kind of -- one is on the left, the other one is in the middle of the page. So that's what that is.

We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. 
Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. 
Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new [ equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in ] Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures. 
 
North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. 
Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. 
In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. 
Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. 
Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. 
This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. 
And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. 
As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. 
In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. 
Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. 
I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. 
New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. 
We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. 
Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. 
New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. 
As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. 
We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. 
Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. 
Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. 
In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued -- is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. 
In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

And I want to close by reminding you of the strong fundamentals behind this fantastic business. This is truly an iconic brand in this large industry, where we have been the leader. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain and new equipment to continue to expand on our leading 2 million unit service portfolio, the heart of our recurring business model, where we'll continue to focus on margin expansion through productivity. And in these difficult times, we're going to continue to invest for growth, maintaining a sustainable level of R&D and capital expenditures to ensure that when we all return to our normal lives, we are still at the forefront of technology, driving digital innovations, providing new solutions for our customers and empowering our field professionals with tools to make them more effective.

I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment -- the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small -- slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing -- even in China, where the markets were down, we were -- our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. 
And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And -- but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. 
Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like at our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and -- even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. 
But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and -- which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and -- especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year."

So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions.

But as you can imagine, we are talking to a lot of customers as they do rebound and more importantly, reopen and come off pause as to how they want their buildings to be utilized, especially in the office and commercial space, whether that's malls or more importantly, office buildings. So we've got lots of requests to help with limited spacing. We've gotten helps -- requests to help with additional products. But I think what it does is it reinforces our Compass product, our destination dispatch product, which does allow touch-free utilization as well as improved utilization of elevators. So it's early days to see where -- when the recovery happens and how the world reopens, but we're in significant dialogue with lots of our customers across all segments on that."

Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation.

So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 to Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So -- and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment.
Now what you will see -- and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China -- Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then -- so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done -- we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower CapEx. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's -- we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. 
Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to -- includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that we'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken -- the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint."

But as we look at booked margin on the service side, it was up fairly significantly, mainly in EMEA and China. And then it was up more significantly than the new equipment booked margin was up. But the new equipment book margin, obviously, it drives our $16.5 billion backlog fairly substantively over the ensuing 24 months. So any time we can get that booked margin up on orders, be it in China or anywhere else in the world, it's a nice rolling tailwind for us as we look into the next year's sales."

So we do expect a fairly sharp decline in organic revenue year-over-year, and it's going to be more so on the new equipment side for -- and then less on the service -- and then the service is going to be mainly on modernization and repair. But the new equipment side is going to be impacted substantially in Q2. So that is what we are expecting. So you're right in terms of modeling. Obviously, we had a good start to the year. Q2 should kind of maybe kind of offset some of that, and then we see recovery in -- on the new equipment side starting to happen in the back half of the year."

We -- and if you see our restructuring numbers, we upped that to $70 million to $80 million. We spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us to. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals. That includes furloughs and executive pay reductions, all the things that you would expect us to do. And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether -- how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back. And our goal will be to ensure that we take enough structural cost out to mitigate the impact of any onetime headwind that we will get from these actions that we're taking."

We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. 
The 2 biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain -- we have 40,000 service -- field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. 
So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue. And once we get through those, we see service having the potential to accelerate."

So that's our overall contribution on new equipment. And the service side, it's obviously higher. And so we -- overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out to about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the -- in the green bucket. As we spoke about, we have taken actions wherever we could to reduce the underabsorption through -- whether it's through restructuring actions or through furlough. So we are taking actions to reduce the underabsorption. So we kind of -- one is on the left, the other one is in the middle of the page. So that's what that is.

On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Please note, except where otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other significant items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast. 
We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Otis' SEC filings, including its registration statements on Form 10 and Form S-3 and its Form 10-Q, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

We hope that everyone listening across all of our stakeholders is safe and well. We're glad that you could join us today on Otis' first earnings call post-spin, another important milestone for us in this new era as an independent company. 
Before I discuss our first quarter results and Otis' outlook, let me share some insights into our people, our business, our management through this crisis and more importantly, our commitment to our long-term strategy and values. Employee health and safety, a core value, is first and paramount to us. I am proud of our 69,000 colleagues who are supporting our customers and the riding public during these unprecedented times. Elevator maintenance and repair was deemed an essential service in most countries and cities. And we continue to service the largest global maintenance portfolio, including elevators in hospitals, critical infrastructure and residential buildings, and we're doing this while prioritizing and paying utmost attention to ensure the health and safety of our workforce around the world, allowing many employees to work from home and providing the proper PPE and guidelines for safe and hygienic working conditions for our colleagues in the field and our manufacturing operations. 
Early in Q1, we made critical decisions to ensure business continuity, and this helped us navigate the COVID-19 impacts, first in China and many countries throughout the world. Today, all 14 of our principal factories are open. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job locally and globally in minimizing disruptions to our factories and our field sites while meeting customer demands. Our decision to air-ship critical parts early during this outbreak has enabled us to protect the supply chain, and we're confident that Otis factories around the world are ready to manufacture at full capacity as soon as job site demand resumes and businesses start to return to normal. During this time, we've extended support to our vendors where necessary, providing advances to limit supply disruptions. 
Let's discuss the new equipment segment by region. China has seen substantial recovery within the quarter. At this point, China factories have returned to full capacity, and access to China new equipment job sites is returning at varying pace by city to pre-COVID levels. In Asia Pacific, we're installing new [ equipment in several areas, including Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, while the currently hardest-hit areas are India and certain countries in ] Southeast Asia, where our access to job sites is limited and there are labor shortages due to government-imposed measures. 
 
North America and EMEA continue to experience job site closures in certain areas and cities that are preventing the installation of new equipment, and we are monitoring the situation closely as job sites reopen. 
Moving to service. As I mentioned earlier, elevator maintenance and repair was deemed essential in most areas, allowing Otis' service professionals to provide critical maintenance for our customers. Maintenance and repair made up 80% of Otis' services sales in 2019, and our maintenance business remains resilient, while we are experiencing some pressure on our repair business where buildings are shut down. Our field professionals continue to support round-the-clock service at hospitals across the globe. 
In North America and EMEA, we have seen a greater need to support a few limited customers within the hardest-hit verticals with delayed payment terms and concessions during building closures. We will continue to strengthen our long-term customer relationships. 
Modernization, the other 20% of our service business, is expected to see impacts from COVID-19 as discretionary projects are put on hold, especially in North America and Europe. However, some code-driven and technologically required modernizations are driving activity in Asia Pacific and other regions. 
Across our business, we responded with cost containment actions to address the evolving situation and associated sales declines. Our China team was focused on immediate actions, which did minimize the first quarter financial impact. Cost containment actions already underway include a global hiring freeze, reduction in travel and other discretionary costs, merit and salary deferrals, reducing executive pay and furloughs in certain locations. These are difficult but necessary actions, and our team continues to assess and adjust to address the evolving situation. 
This crisis has also shown us that our Otis absolutes, safety, ethics and quality, drive our commitment to each other, our customers, our passengers, our investors and to the communities where we live and work. In multiple countries across the world, we use 3D printing technology to manufacture face shields for use by our teams and by frontline workers in hospitals. In Wuhan, beyond providing uninterrupted elevator maintenance, we donated elevator cab air purifiers to several hospitals. 
And lastly, we pledged to match employee contributions to COVID-19 relief funds, and our colleagues continue to volunteer in local communities in many ways. 
As the world reopens, we will continue to innovate and lead our industry. We're leveraging technology to allow smartphones to interact with elevators for remote floor selection and providing disinfectants and fans to assist in a cleaner environment in services for elevators and escalators. We're working closely with many customers who requested elevator adaptations as their buildings reopen and people return to work locations, and we will do all of this while investing for the long term. 
Now let me turn to our first quarter results on Slide 4. As you've seen from our earnings release yesterday, the first quarter was a solid start for Otis in spite of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent global spread. On April 3, we successfully separated from United Technologies, returning to our roots as an independent company while exemplifying various elements of Otis' culture, our innovation, empowerment and collaboration. Over 200 IT systems were replicated, more than 600 procurement and IT contracts re-signed and almost 500 processes cut over. We created several new departments, including tax, treasury and investor relations and executed nearly 50 facility moves in 18 countries. I'd be remiss if I didn't once again thank our team for this historic undertaking, rising to the occasion and setting us off on the right foot as an independent Otis. 
In terms of liquidity, we had approximately $1.4 billion of cash at the time of separation and have an undrawn $1.5 billion revolver, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. During the first quarter, we placed over $6 billion of debt at favorable rates. That led to a $30 million reduction in interest expense from our initial expectations. We announced a Q2 dividend yesterday of $0.20 per share and plan to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in the balance of the year. 
Q1 results continued the strong operational momentum that you saw during 2019. New equipment orders increased 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, with double-digit growth in the Americas and mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. Organic sales declined slightly, excluding China, where top line growth was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Adjusted operating profit increased $17 million, and we achieved margin expansion in both the new equipment and service segments with 120 basis points of margin expansion overall. Free cash flow conversion was 73%, including the impact of spin-related tax prepayments. 
I'm pleased with the strong first quarter results despite the impact from COVID-19. However, we are not immune from the broader economic impact as this pandemic spreads across the globe. With this in mind, we are updating our 2020 outlook. We now expect organic sales to be down 3% to 7%, reflecting recovery beginning in early Q3 at the high end and a delayed second half recovery at the low end. Adjusted operating profit is expected to decline $25 million to $175 million at constant currency, reflecting volume declines, partially offset by cost containment actions I previously described. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million. This net income outlook reflects the reduction in interest expense and a 1 point adjusted tax rate improvement from our expectations in February. And lastly, we expect free cash flow conversion to remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with Q1 results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 4.4%, with slightly less than half of the decline coming from organic sales and the vast from the impact of foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. Strong organic sales growth of 3.3% in the service segment was more than offset by a 9.8% decline in new equipment due in part to COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit was up approximately 4% or $17 million and up $27 million at constant currency. Operating profit growth at constant currency was driven by approximately $45 million of operational improvement from higher service volume, strong material and service productivity, lower SG&A and transactional foreign exchange favorability. This was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 that reduced operating profit by an estimated $17 million due to lower volume and underabsorption of costs. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 120 basis points to 15.2%, with margin expansion in both new equipment and service segments. R&D as a percentage of sales was flat versus prior year, and adjusted SG&A expense improved by about $30 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was down $0.02 as the $0.04 improvement from operating profit and lower net interest cost was more than offset by $0.06 of headwind from tax due to an unfavorable year-over-year compare in the quarter and higher noncontrolling interest costs. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders grew 5.6% at constant currency, excluding China, and were flat overall for Otis. New equipment orders grew double digits in the Americas; mid-single digits in Europe and the Middle East; and declined low teens in Asia, including China. This strong order growth was delivered in a global market that was down mid-single digits excluding China and down mid-teens globally as the China market declined an estimated 20% in Q1. 
New equipment share continued to grow and was up an estimated 25 basis points in the quarter. While the overall bookings were down in Asia, we continued to see progress in the infrastructure segment and received several key orders, including for the Chongqing and Nantong metro projects in China. As we discussed on Investor Day, this is one of our key target segments, and our infrastructure bookings grew high teens in a segment that was down low double digits. 
We also saw pricing stability in most parts of the world with 80 basis points of booked margin expansion. Booked margin expanded in EMEA and China and was offset slightly by the pressure in Asia outside of China. America's booked margin was flat. 
Backlog was up 3% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth in Americas and EMEA offset by a low single-digit decline in China. Organic sales were down 9.8% with double-digit declines in Asia, including China, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Sales in Americas declined 9%, reflecting a tough compare and the impact of lower order intake in Q1 of 2019. Sales in Europe were up low single digits, but this was more than offset by weak results in Middle East due to market softness. Overall, new equipment sales in EMEA were down 3%. 
New equipment adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points, a strong material productivity and a small benefit from lower commodity prices was more than offset the impact of volume decline. Material productivity in the quarter exceeded our long-term target of 3%, reflecting the benefit of the actions that we are taking. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remain strong in the first quarter. Modernization orders grew 2.5% with high-teens growth in Asia, outside of China and Europe, primarily offset by a high single-digit decline in the Americas. Our maintenance portfolio grew by 1%. Organic sales increased 3.3%, with modernization sales up 6.8% and maintenance and repair sales up 2.5%. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 20 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency as strong productivity, favorability in price and mix and lower SG&A expense was partially offset by higher labor costs. Service contribution expanded for the seventh straight quarter with growth in all major regions. 
As we close out the first quarter, our operational agenda remains on track, and we are pleased with the progress on key initiatives: driving share gain in new equipment, making continuous progress on service contributions, material cost productivity and containing SG&A costs. However, as the economic activity slows globally from the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing the impact on our business activity in the second quarter, which is highlighted on Slide 8, with the new equipment orders and factory shipments both down in April outside of China after a relatively strong start in the first couple of months of the year. 
We are also seeing a reduction in service sales in April due to the challenges created by closure of buildings impacting our modernization and repair business. While China activity is recovering, it is clear that the business in China will not be immune to the global slowdown. And as we look at the balance of the year, we need to adjust our revenue and earnings growth expectation that we had communicated in February while taking incremental cost actions to offset the impact to earnings from sales shortfall. 
Let me start with sales on Slide 9. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 3% to 7% for the year with a 5% to 10% decline in new equipment and a low to mid-single-digit decline in service. The low end or a 10% decline in new equipment reflects continuation of the first half trend into second half, while the high end or a 5% decline reflects a recovery in the second half of 2020 to 2019 levels. We do expect continued stability in our contractual maintenance business. However, the range of service sales outlook reflects varying degrees of delay and push out discretionary repair and modernization projects to continue in the back half of the year, depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million at constant currency and between $85 million and $235 million at actual currency. At the midpoint, this reflects nearly $300 million of cost containment actions that Judy alluded to earlier. Most of these actions are already announced and at varying stages of implementation. At the midpoint of our sales outlook, we would expect operating margins to be relatively flat. 
Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $940 million driven by reduced operating profit, partially offset by lower tax rate and noncontrolling interest costs. We are reducing our tax rate guidance for 2020 to approximately 32% from 33% at Investor Day and are working on additional projects to continue to reduce the rate over time. Free cash flow will remain strong between 110% and 120% of net income as reduction in profit and higher restructuring costs will be partially offset by reduced capital expenditures. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the new equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we are seeing in Q2 with job site closures. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates work resuming in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year. 
In EMEA, there's significant delays and limited access to job sites in South Europe, the U.K., parts of Russia and the Middle East. The EMEA new equipment business has continued -- is expected to be down high single digits to 10%, with the high end of the range reflecting job sites reopening in pre-COVID levels in Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
In China, the new equipment business is recovering in Q2. And in rest of Asia, activity in Japan and South Korea has held up relatively well. But we continue to face challenges in India and Southeast Asia from government-imposed lockdown measures. We expect the Asia new equipment business to be down mid- to high single digits depending on the pace of recovery in India and Southeast Asia and the extent of impact of the Japanese and South Korean economies from the pandemic. 
In the service segment, our contractual maintenance business has been resilient, and we anticipate this business to continue to be stable. However, there have been delays on discretionary repair and modernization projects as these projects push into 2021. and we now expect modernization sales to be down mid- to high single digits and maintenance and repair to be down low single digits for the year. Overall, the high end of the 3% to 7% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to profit outlook on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be down between $25 million and $175 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic; incremental underabsorption of costs; higher bad debt expense due to deteriorating credit outlook; and an impact to pricing, especially at the higher end of the sales decline. This will be partially offset by the cost actions we have taken and will take in the balance of the year. 
Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $60 million for the year versus the $20 million that we were expecting in February due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 
Moving to 2020 capital deployment on Slide 12. At spin, our net debt-to-EBITDA was about 2.4x with $1.4 billion in cash. During 2020, we expect to generate between $925 million to $1.025 billion of cash and plan to pay down $250 million of debt and return $260 million to shareholders through dividends between Q2 and Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income. Approximately $200 million will be spent between noncontrolling interest and M&A. We believe these capital deployment plans are prudent during these uncertain times as they allow us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year and are consistent with what we announced in February, reflecting our confidence in the cash flow generation capacity of this business. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

And I want to close by reminding you of the strong fundamentals behind this fantastic business. This is truly an iconic brand in this large industry, where we have been the leader. Over the medium term, we expect sustainable growth and global share gain and new equipment to continue to expand on our leading 2 million unit service portfolio, the heart of our recurring business model, where we'll continue to focus on margin expansion through productivity. And in these difficult times, we're going to continue to invest for growth, maintaining a sustainable level of R&D and capital expenditures to ensure that when we all return to our normal lives, we are still at the forefront of technology, driving digital innovations, providing new solutions for our customers and empowering our field professionals with tools to make them more effective.

I mean, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new equipment -- the booked margin actually expanded. We saw that, and it was pretty strong across the globe with small -- slight pressure in Asia. But outside of that, it was fairly good. So really, really good start to the year. In America, where we saw some pricing last year, the pricing was stable this year. Europe, we saw good pricing. And the same thing -- even in China, where the markets were down, we were -- our booked margins actually went up a little bit. So good start to the year on the new equipment side. 
And same thing on service pricing as well. And the service pricing held up really well in Q1. And we gained a little bit of price in Q1, and we implemented our regularly scheduled price increases that we had planned. Having said that, I mean, the situation in Q2 is different, and we're working with our customers in the hardest-hit sectors in hospitality, in retail, et cetera, that Judy mentioned a little bit in her prepared comments. These sectors make up about less than 10% of our service installed base. And -- but these are temporary concessions and therefore, a very specific period of time, and we do not expect any long-term impact from these. 
Also, most of our customers do understand that we do have fixed costs like at our Otis call center, and we need to maintain and address service issues and -- even when the buildings are only partially occupied. So that is why the concession requests have been very limited, and we've addressed each one of them individually. 
But as we gave guidance, we obviously factored in that these concession requests might increase. Again, as I said, we have not seen a lot of these. There have been a few and -- which we've addressed them at one at a time. But in our guidance, we've assumed some impact and -- especially at the higher end of the range. And same thing on new equipment. We've assumed that there is a little bit of pricing pressure in the back end of the year, especially on the new orders. Now most of that will not impact this year. But on the service pricing, the concessions that we're talking about will come through our results this year. So that's what we've kind of guided to. Same thing on the bad debt. The results were okay in Q1. There was not a lot of incremental P&L expense. We did take not a lot of incremental P&L expense in Q1, but we have factored some in our outlook at the back end of the year."

So we're taking incremental actions. And beyond that, we are working on several initiatives to structure our business better and to reduce the tax that we pay on high-tax jurisdictions.

Maybe just help us understand that free cash flow pressure in the first quarter and how quickly the free cash flow recovers. And also, I guess, I was a bit confused, because if I look at the material, I think you have about $975 million of free cash flow guide at the midpoint. I guess excluding [ NCI ], about $890 million of adjusted net income at the midpoint. So it's maybe about a 110% conversion on adjusted net. But I think the conversion you present is versus GAAP net income. So just wanted to check that. And does that mean that GAAP net income and adjusted net income are broadly similar for the year even with that big delta in Q1?"

Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 to Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin.",605,"Yes. Let me -- yes. Let's start with Q1 cash, Julian. So we feel we had a good start to the year despite the COVID-19 situation. So in our Q1 cash, we pulled forward about $70 million of tax payments from Q2 to Q4, and that was primarily due to the spin. So that's in our Q1 results. Again, Judy had it in the prepared remarks. Also, we did extend support to our vendors, especially in China. And you see that our payables were down about $200 million from December to March. So -- and part of this decline was to support getting our supply chain up and ready in China, and this cash flow impact should get mitigated between Q2 and Q3. But despite the impact that we saw in China, our working capital actually came down by about $30 million in the quarter, and then we had about $47 million of separation costs. So overall, we feel that we had a very strong performance operationally given the pull forward of tax payments, the impact that we saw in China given the support that we had to extend to our vendors and then the separation costs. So working capital coming down. So overall, we feel really good about how our business performed on cash given the overall environment.
Now what you will see -- and going back to your second question on how this kind of translates into the rest of the year. Now Q2 is going to be a little bit challenging in Europe and China -- Europe and the U.S. China is going to recover, but we will see some pressure in Q2 in Europe and the U.S. And then -- so our cash flow will be a little bit more skewed towards Q3 and Q4 than it typically is, but you would expect that given the overall macroeconomic environment. But we feel good about our guidance. I think we've done -- we've taken good steps to offset and mitigate some of the impact that is coming through from the drop in net income from our previous guide to this guide. I mean if you look at the guide-to-guide on our net income, probably down at the midpoint at AFX, about $150 million. And we've mitigated that through lower CapEx. We've reduced our interest cost. There are some tax payments that we try to manage, some of that coming through the CARES Act. But we try to put all that in and yet drive $975 million of cash as kind of the midpoint. So it's -- we feel good about our back-end recovery in cash flow. 
Now on the conversion question, you're right, Julian. It is about 110% on our reported net income basis. But the guide that we provided to -- includes some of the cash that will outflow on the separation costs, the PSA payments that we'll have to make to UTC. So we factored that in. And some of the restructuring that we've taken -- the restructuring has actually gone up year-over-year as well. So that reflects some of the impact on that. So adjusting for some of the onetime expenses we will have, the number is between $110 million to $120 million. And we've excluded any noncash onetimers. Like the asset write-off that we had in Q1, we've excluded that from the calculation. So it is purely on the GAAP net income adjusting for any noncash charges that we will have. So that's the guide. That's the range, $110 million to $120 million. And as adjusted net income, which we'll speak to, that's at 110% at the midpoint."

We -- and if you see our restructuring numbers, we upped that to $70 million to $80 million. We spent about $50 million to $60 million last year. So it's incrementally higher. We are looking at our structural cost at a very, very hard way, looking at where duplication of work is happening, pulling that out. So we are taking a lot of hard restructuring actions, as you would expect us to. So that's a piece of the cost takeout. But a lot of these actions may have a more limited impact in 2020 and probably help us in 2021 more than they help us in 2020. In 2020, a lot of the benefit that you will see come through is going to be from the short-term actions that we are taking. So that includes merit deferrals. That includes furloughs and executive pay reductions, all the things that you would expect us to do. And we're going to watch this thing very carefully, and it depends on whether -- how it translates into 2021, depends on how the revenue comes back.

We've looked back and modeled the global financial crisis to understand what transpired there. And for those of you that covered Otis as part of UTC back then, you'll recall we had a 10 percentage point, not just 10 basis points, 10 percentage point higher ROS than our local nearest competitors. 
The 2 biggest differences that we're seeing coming with COVID-19 right now in 2020 are the precipitous building closures, which are having an impact, not just on the construction side but on our access for repairs, especially discretionary repairs. We did not see this during the global financial crisis. And the other key element is there's no oversupply right now of the skilled technicians and field professionals, which we did have back in the global financial crisis. So we have worked extremely hard to maintain -- we have 40,000 service -- field professionals, 33,000 service to make sure that, working with our workers' councils, our unions, that we have retained and are engaged with our field workforce because this is a labor business, and they're the strength of our company to drive all of our servicing globally. We have the liquidity as well, which some of the ISPs won't have. 
So we see the dynamic changing. We've started a recapture campaign while our sales forces are mainly working from home to be able to grow our portfolio and to get some of our customers back, who may have left us for ISPs over the years. And then we have sustained our investment in our Otis ONE IoT offering so that we'll continue to have both technological as well as transparent and predictive information to be able to provide service in a more productive way and a better way for our customers. So I actually see service coming out of this once we get through the discretionary delays. I don't think they're a demand issue. It's really a delay issue.

And so we -- overall, if you look across the entire business, that averages out to about 25%, 26% contribution margin. But then there is some underabsorption of cost when the revenue decline is as sharp as what we're seeing this year, especially on the service side because the fact is in service, we primarily use our own technicians to service the elevators and modernize those elevators. So that's where we see some incremental pressure because of underabsorption of cost. So that's what we've kind of modeled in that bucket. It's that contribution margin, plus there's an incremental impact from underabsorption of cost. Now we are working to offset that and you see some of that on the -- in the green bucket.

We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times. 
To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of new equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis' field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the new equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business. 
In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services, we are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months. 
Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of new equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations. 
To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the paradigm for parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity. 
Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the new equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world. 
We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and the outlook in more detail."

As we anticipated and",1819,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the new equipment and service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense. We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both new equipment and service segments. In the new equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories [indiscernible] of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment. 
Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions. 
Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East. New equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, new equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, a strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and under absorption of costs. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remains strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion. 
We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May. 
Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is falling suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to new equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered potential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen. 
We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both new equipment and service versus prior guidance. We now expect new equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. In the new equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with weighting pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint, and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental under absorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year, and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in may due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020. And now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income, and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which, depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. Our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year.

Globally, it's over 90%. In April, we were at about a 65% global. Again, the current restricted areas are more so in India and Southeast Asia. So the job sites are reopening. In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason there -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential. And we're seeing residential projects grow strongly. So our outlook really does anticipate that we get back to New Equipment levels sometime in 2021, and that is -- that we will obviously modulate our costs based on what we see, both the orders coming in second half of this year. And then as we see the new equipment business coming back as well. Rahul?"

So I mean, it's overall, it's an uncertain environment, definitely fluid. But so far, the business seems to be recovering well. And as Judy mentioned, the job sites are coming back, and that's what we're kind of focused on right now, it's just making sure that we are executing in the backlog that we have, and what will drive our revenue in the near-term is obviously the backlog, which is good to see that our backlog is actually up 2% year-over-year through the second half. And then as we look forward into 2021, we'll stay focused on maintaining this backlog growth that you've seen, accelerating the pace of conversion from backlog into new equipment revenue, driving cost out to ensure that we can stay competitive on margins and deliver strong margins.

Our business in Germany did really well in the second quarter, so that we are seeing the Nordics, German market come -- Switzerland, come back strongly, and Southern Europe is a little bit slower, as you would expect, given what you saw happen with the pandemic. So that is definitely the case. But even if you look we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world. So that obviously helps the overall mix and how the various sectors recover and the residential market matters more to us in Europe and probably in some other parts of the world."

I mean, we've seen the pressure, right? It's like the book margins were down 70 basis points. And you would expect that. I mean, Asia Pacific, given what's happening in India, given what's happening in Southeast Asia and the Indian economy still hasn't opened up. And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world, the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our  medium-term outlook that we have quired at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the new equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period. We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium-term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the under absorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll be with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worrying? Absolutely, it's worrying. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price.

So there's a little bit of still fluidity in the market, but this will be counterbalanced by China, to some extent, because we are catching up in certain areas in China, and we do not expect China to be strong in Q3. So overall, maybe on the new equipment side, slight skew towards Q4. And on the service side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our repair activity is still subdued due to the lower building occupancy, some of the buildings are not fully opened yet, and we expect gradual improvement as we go through the year.

We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times.  
To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of New Equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the New Equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business.  
In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services. We are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months.  
Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of New Equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations.  
To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity.  
Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New Equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the New Equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world.  
We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs.  
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and the outlook in more detail."

As we anticipated and",1819,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense. We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both New Equipment and Service segments. In the New Equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories [ fall ] of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment.  
Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our Service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions.  
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first  half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East.  New Equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, as strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and underabsorption of costs.  
Service segment results on Slide 7 remains strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion.  
We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May.  
Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is following suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to New Equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered essential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen.  
We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service versus prior guidance. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. In the New Equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term.  
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with varying pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year.  
Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental underabsorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in May due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  
An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

So we have seen about 70 basis points of booked margin impact in the second quarter. That was mainly in EMEA, in Asia Pacific. China itself was flattish, and the Americas actually had improved booked margin. And as you understand, this flows through to our revenue, primarily in 2021. We do expect some pressure. We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. Our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year. So Service pricing is holding up well. Booked margin is down 70 basis points on New Equipment. But again, China flattish, and we understand what we need to do to drive cost out and drive productivity up."

Globally, it's over 90%. In April, we were at about a 65% global. Again, the current restricted areas are more so in India and Southeast Asia. So the job sites are reopening. In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason there -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential. And we're seeing residential projects grow strongly. So our outlook really does anticipate that we get back to New Equipment levels sometime in 2021, and that is -- that we will obviously modulate our costs based on what we see, both the orders coming in second half of this year and then as we see the New Equipment business coming back as well.

So I mean, it's overall, it's an uncertain environment, definitely fluid. But so far, the business seems to be recovering well. And as Judy mentioned, the job sites are coming back, and that's what we're kind of focused on right now, it's just making sure that we are executing in the backlog that we have, and what will drive our revenue in the near term is obviously the backlog, which is good to see that our backlog is actually up 2% year-over-year through the second half. And then as we look forward into 2021, we'll stay focused on maintaining this backlog growth that you've seen, accelerating the pace of conversion from backlog into New Equipment revenue, driving cost out to ensure that we can stay competitive on margins and deliver strong margins.

So that is definitely the case. But even if you look -- we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA, is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world. So that obviously helps the overall mix and how the various sectors recover. And the residential market matters more to us in Europe and probably in some other parts of the world."

We saw our booked margin, and Judy repeated this in the response to Nigel's question. I mean, we've seen the pressure, right? It's like the booked margins were down 70 basis points. And you would expect that. I mean, Asia Pacific, given what's happening in India, given what's happening in Southeast Asia and the Indian economy still hasn't opened up. And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world at the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our medium-term outlook that we have provided at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the New Equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period. We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the underabsorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll be with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worrying? Absolutely, it's worrying. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price.

We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times.  
To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of New Equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the New Equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business.  
In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services. We are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months.  
Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of New Equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations.  
To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity.  
Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New Equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the New Equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world.  
We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs.  
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and the outlook in more detail."

As we anticipated and",1818,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense. We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both New Equipment and Service segments. In the New Equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories [Technical Difficulty] of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment.  
Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our Service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions.  
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East. New Equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. 
Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, as strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and underabsorption of costs.  
Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion.  
We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May.  
Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is following suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to New Equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered essential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen.  
We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service versus prior guidance. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. 
In the New Equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. 
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term.  
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with varying pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. 
In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year.  
Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental underabsorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in May due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.  
An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

So we have seen about 70 basis points of booked margin impact in the second quarter. That was mainly in EMEA, in Asia Pacific. China itself was flattish, and the Americas actually had improved booked margin. And as you understand, this flows through to our revenue, primarily in 2021. We do expect some pressure. We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. So our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year. So Service pricing is holding up well. Booked margin is down 70 basis points on New Equipment. But again, China flattish, and we understand what we need to do to drive cost out and drive productivity up."

In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason they were -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential. And we're seeing residential projects grow strongly. So our outlook really does anticipate that we get back to New Equipment levels sometime in 2021, and that is -- that we will obviously modulate our costs based on what we see, both the orders coming in second half of this year and then as we see the New Equipment business coming back as well.

And as Judy mentioned, the job sites are coming back, and that's what we're kind of focused on right now, it's just making sure that we are executing in the backlog that we have, and what will drive our revenue in the near term is obviously the backlog, which is good to see that our backlog is actually up 2% year-over-year through the second half. And then as we look forward into 2021, we'll stay focused on maintaining this backlog growth that you've seen, accelerating the pace of conversion from backlog into New Equipment revenue, driving cost out to ensure that we can stay competitive on margins and deliver strong margins.

So that is definitely the case. But even if you look -- we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA, is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world.

We saw our booked margin, and Judy repeated this in the response to Nigel's question. I mean, we're seeing the pressure, right? It's like the booked margins were down 70 basis points. And you would expect that. I mean, Asia Pacific, given what's happening in India, given what's happening in Southeast Asia and the Indian economy still hasn't opened up. And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world at the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our medium-term outlook that we have provided at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the New Equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period. We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the underabsorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll deal with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worry? Absolutely, it's a worry. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price.

But as you know, Steve, we had a tremendous amount of remote information from our remote monitoring systems, and these are early days. The residential elevators are getting tremendous usage because most elevators, people are only stepping in, if no one else is in that in condominiums and apartments throughout the world. So the residential usage, we know is up. In the more commercial space and office space, we're working with our customers to understand that. We're adjusting some traffic flow algorithms. Our destination dispatch system is being tuned based on customer requests. But as long as a building is open, it's certainly -- the elevator is getting used and maintained and eventually, will need repair work as well. So early days. Hopefully, we'll have some more data for you on the next call."

Some are doing short-term activities, but others are looking at major modernizations.

We're glad that you could join us today and hope that everyone listening is safe and well. I'm very pleased with our results and grateful for the dedication of our colleagues who provided essential services and supported our customers in efforts to safely reopen job sites and buildings during these unprecedented times. 
To briefly update you on the status of operations in this environment, today, all Otis factories are operating, and approximately 90% of New Equipment job sites are open, up from a low point of about 65%. In the quarter, Otis field professionals provided essential services and our maintenance business remained resilient. However, the shutdown of buildings put understandable pressure on our repair and modernization business. By June, we saw encouraging signs of improvement in many regions. In the New Equipment business, we experienced substantial recovery in China during the second quarter, while North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific continued to experience job site closures in certain areas. Our management team has done an excellent job to proactively contain costs and mitigate the impact from COVID-19. That was reflected in our results reported this morning, especially encouraging in our Service business. 
In terms of liquidity, we ended Q2 with $1.9 billion of cash on hand and have a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, a strong position for us to run the business. This environment has not slowed our progress in executing on our strategies. We continue to introduce new and innovative products with our touchless elevator technologies, traffic flow solutions, purification products, or remote monitoring and predictive maintenance services. We are partnering and bringing solutions to our customers to promote and support the health and safety of their tenants and passengers. We continue to expand our product offerings, launching the Gen2 Prime in India, a low-rise entry-level elevator. This product brings a combination of safety, performance, themed aesthetics and price competitiveness to our India low-rise market with applicability to other developing markets. We continue to build momentum on the deployment of IoT, and we recently launched a new release that added several new features for our customers and to drive productivity in our organization. This new release also improves the scalability of our solution. We have a clear road map to continue to enhance the capability of our IoT solution over the next several months. 
Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy units in U.S., Europe and China in the first half and expect to place -- the pace of IoT deployment to increase substantially in the second half, and we've driven both service and material productivity through our continued IoT technology, our suite of mobility tools via iPhone apps for our field professionals and our global supply chain activities this quarter. These are just a handful of examples that led to 90 basis points of New Equipment share gains during the first half. This progress shows the strength of our strategy. As leaders here at Otis, we're proud of our company's long commitment to diversity and inclusion. Yet we also know there's more to be done if we are to become the company we want to be, an equal opportunity employer of choice for people of all cultures, genders, races and generations. 
To ensure we live up to these aspirations, our leadership team and I launched our commitment to change, which is a framework to help us identify and prioritize the actions we need to take. We continue to demonstrate our commitment as Otis joined the Paradigm for Parity coalition and committed to closing our global leadership gender gap by 2030. People are at the heart of everything we do at Otis, and I'm proud of these important steps. Otis will lead our industry for inclusion and diversity. 
Turning to Slide 4, Q2 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by growth in Asia as China recovers from COVID-19. China orders were up high single digits, including several infrastructure awards. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were flat. New Equipment backlog was up 2% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, organic sales were down 6.5%, driven by double-digit decline in the New Equipment segment and low single-digit decline in the Service segment. Adjusted operating profit was down $24 million at constant currency, and margin expanded 30 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment and the swift cost containment actions we implemented. Free cash flow was robust at $628 million, with 280% conversion of net income, reflecting strong working capital performance in the quarter. These swift cost actions and our organization's commitment to serving customers allowed us to mitigate the bottom line impact from a year-over-year decline in sales, and I'm pleased with the second quarter and first half performance despite the difficult environment we're operating in globally. We are encouraged by the recovery we've experienced in China, and are revising our 2020 outlook to reflect the solid first half performance and anticipated pace of recovery for our business in the second half across the world. 
We are increasing the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected in the range of flat to down $50 million at constant currency, a $75 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint, primarily from higher volume expectations. We now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint versus prior expectations. This reflects our improved operating profit outlook, lower tax rate and lower net interest costs. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust, between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, with full year free cash flow conversion levels between 130% and 140% of GAAP net income.

159264,676890482,2076595,"Otis Worldwide Corporation, Q2 2020 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2020",2020-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Otis Worldwide Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and",1818,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with second quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3 billion, down 9.6%, with a 6.5% decline in organic sales and the rest from foreign exchange and net divestitures in 2019. As we anticipated and communicated during the first quarter earnings call, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically in the second quarter, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was down approximately 8% or $39 million, and down $24 million at constant currency. Operating profit declined at constant currency from the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions that we offered to our customers to support them during these difficult times and a small increase in year-over-year bad debt expense. We were able to partially offset this by strong productivity in both New Equipment and Service segments. In the New Equipment segment, our material productivity in the factories
[Audio Gap]
of 3% for the second quarter in a row, and in the Service segment, maintenance hours per unit continued to trend down. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and our adjusted SG&A expenses were down close to $40 million year-over-year. At the same time, we maintained the investment in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution and a favorable segment mix drove 30 basis points of margin expansion with continued margin expansion in the service segment. 
Second quarter adjusted EPS was down $0.03, as a $0.05 decline from operating profit was partially offset by a $0.02 increase primarily from favorable tax rate and lower interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook provided during Q1 earnings call, driven by the resiliency of our Service business model and our focus on productivity and proactive management of cost and customer concessions. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were down 6.8% at constant currency and were flat on a rolling 12-month basis. Our order intake continues to outperform the market that was down high single-digit, resulting in a 110 basis point increase in global market share in the quarter. Booked margins were down 70 basis points in the quarter and were flat year-over-year for the first half. In the quarter, booked margins were down in Asia and parts of Europe, and were partially offset by improvement in the Americas and the Middle East. New Equipment backlog was up 2% at constant currency from growth in the Americas, and backlog margin was up slightly over prior year. 
Organic sales were down 10.4%, with double-digit declines in the Americas and EMEA, reflecting the impact of job site closures in April and May. Sales in Asia were up 1.6%, as decline in Asia Pacific was more than offset by strength in China. China new equipment sales were up high single digits as job sites reopened and business returned to pre-COVID levels. At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $46 million, and margin contracted 230 basis points, as strong material productivity and cost containment in the field was more than offset by the impact from lower volume and underabsorption of costs. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by 1%, with units in China up more than 5%. Modernization orders were down 4% as strong orders growth in China, driven by mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. Organic sales were down 3.3%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while the building shutdowns impacted discretionary repair and modernization sales. 
Adjusted operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points, and profit grew by $14 million at constant currency, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt. Pricing environment, excluding the impact of price concessions, was modestly favorable. Overall, we closed out a solid first half in which our organic sales were down slightly more than 4%, with flat year-over-year service revenue and a 70 basis point margin expansion. 
We are maintaining the execution momentum in the business and continue to make progress on key strategic initiatives: gaining share in new equipment, driving material and service productivity and containing SG&A costs. And while a challenging -- while we face a challenging business and economic environment, our operational metrics are recovering from the lows of April and May. 
Turning to Slide 8. China has shown a swift recovery as business returns to normal, and the rest of the world is following suit at varying paces. We have seen improvement in access to New Equipment job sites throughout Q2 in every region. Access has largely returned to normal in the Americas and EMEA, while Asia Pacific has shown improvement, but is still facing some challenges in India and Southeast Asia due to government-imposed measures. The maintenance business was resilient in the quarter and considered essential in most areas. Access, where it was limited, has returned to normal levels towards the end of June and early Q3. Lastly, overall repair volumes are still below last year and Q1, but trends are heading in the right direction, with a number of service requests from our customers continuing to increase, and we expect to see a recovery to pre-COVID levels in the balance of the year as buildings reopen. 
We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress in the first half and these encouraging trends. On Slide 9, we now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 4% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 3% to 7%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service versus prior guidance. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid- to high single digits and service sales to be flat to down low single digits. 
In the New Equipment segment, we are assuming varying rates of recovery, with the high end reflecting a slight growth in the second half of the year. In the Service segment, maintenance business has proved to be resilient in this environment, and the range reflects differing degrees of delay in discretionary repair and modernization projects in the back half of the year depending on the overall macroeconomic environment and the occupancy level of buildings. 
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be flat to down $50 million at constant currency, and down $40 million to $100 million at actual currency. At constant currency, the outlook increased by $75 million at the midpoint, reflecting the higher revenue versus prior guidance, strong progress on cost containment actions and a small improvement in service pricing outlook. We expect operating margin expansion in a range of 10 to 30 basis points. 
Adjusted EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.20 to $2.30, up $0.20 at the midpoint, driven by improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs, lower tax rate and a reduced share count. We are lowering our full year tax rate guidance to 31.5% from 32% in May, and down from 33% on Investor Day. We expect the tax planning work that we're doing to continue to yield benefits and the tax rate to trend down to between 25% to 28% over the medium term. 
Taking a further look at our organic growth assumptions on Slide 10. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is expected to be down mid-single digits to 10%, reflecting the sharp decline we saw in Q2. The high end or a 5% decline contemplates a rapid recovery in Q3 and growth in the back half of the year, while the lower end reflects continuing challenges in accessing the job sites. The EMEA New Equipment business is expected to be down high single digits, reflecting business recovering to pre-COVID levels during Q3 in North Europe and a gradual recovery in South Europe and the Middle East. 
We are improving the Asia New Equipment outlook due to strong recovery we experienced in China during Q2, and now expect Asia to be down mid-single digits. This reflects the continuing recovery in China with varying pace of recovery across Asia Pacific, with challenges in India and Southeast Asia, while the rest of Asia holds up well. 
In the Service business, we anticipate the maintenance business to remain stable into the back half of the year, with continued pressure on discretionary repair early in Q3 and recovery in the later months of the year, and expect the overall maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly for the year. While our modernization sales grew in the first half, there is potential for modernization projects to push out into 2021. And we now expect modernization sales to be flat to down low single digits. Overall, the high end of the 2% to 4% organic sales decline reflects an early Q3 recovery globally, and the low end assumes first half conditions to continue into the second half of the year. 
Switching to operating profit on Slide 11. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit improved by $75 million from the May guidance at the midpoint and is now expected to be flat to down $50 million versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental underabsorption of costs and an impact on pricing, including some temporary price concessions in our Service business. We will continue to offset these impacts through strong material and service productivity and cost containment actions that are tracking as per prior expectations. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of $40 million to $50 million for the year and an improvement from the $60 million of headwind that we had expected in May due to the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 12. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash on hand and expect to generate between $1 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow in 2020 and now plan to pay down $350 million of debt instead of the original placeholder of $250 million in 2020. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 at about 40% of adjusted net income and spend approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and will enable us to increase the cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, which depending on the overall liquidity conditions in the market, can potentially allow us to start share buyback in 2021 after we complete our previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for some closing remarks."

So we have seen about 70 basis points of booked margin impact in the second quarter. That was mainly in EMEA, in Asia Pacific. China itself was flattish, and the Americas actually had improved booked margin. And as you understand, this flows through to our revenue, primarily in 2021. We do expect some pressure. We expected it this quarter. We expect some in the remaining half of the year on pricing because pricing follows macroeconomic trends. And this is really why we have focused so hard on cost containment and our productivity initiatives. The only part we don't have in our outlook is any additional activities driven by stimulus, and that could also impact pricing probably favorably. So our Service pricing is holding up well. Outside of the price concessions, we did get our normal price increases throughout the first half of the year. The price concessions themselves were a little less than we anticipated, primarily in the hospitality space, hospitality and retail, and we have included those in our outlook for the remainder of this year. So Service pricing is holding up well. Booked margin is down 70 basis points on New Equipment. But again, China flattish, and we understand what we need to do to drive cost out and drive productivity up."

In North America, we are almost totally reopened. But as we reopen, we're seeing some different behaviors due to health and safety concerns. So we're making sure we do initial safety start-ups, and obviously, we have to separate some of the workforce in terms of how the construction crews are coming back as well. In terms of what we're seeing on buying behaviors, the orders in -- especially in North America, in this last quarter were down. And the reason they were -- a lot of the reason they were down was that the decisions were just not being made and were being delayed. When we speak to the customers, they're optimistic, and they still plan on moving forward with their projects. Additionally, when you look at our end market exposure, we are -- and we shared this in the Appendix, we are far more than 50% driven by residential.

So that is definitely the case. But even if you look -- we did provide some color on the overall industry. But if you look at our European business as well, Europe, especially, the fact is that close to 70% of our Europe business in Europe, cumulatively in the EMEA, is residential, so we are a little bit more heavily skewed on the residential side in EMEA versus the rest of the world.

And in terms of units, that's the second largest economy in the world at the elevator market. So it's clearly an issue, right? And we are not hiding from that. And as Judy said, rightfully so, the pricing will depend on the overall macroeconomic environment. But if you go back to right from the Investor Day, what we're seeing and what we did not build into our medium-term outlook that we have provided at Investor Day, we did not build in any margin increase on the New Equipment side of the business. And the reason we did not is we expected the pricing pressures to manifest themselves over this time period. We did not know that will be the second half of 2020 versus '21, but we knew that they were going to come at some point. And that's why starting last year, we have been so focused on driving material productivity. And we set a target for us for 3% over this medium term every year over the next 3 to 4 years. And if you look at the first half, it's great to see that we've done this now 2 quarters in a row. And that is helping. I mean if you look at our margin trajectory this quarter, and even for the first half, we're basically falling through -- our earnings are falling through at the contribution margin. That means we are able to absorb all the underabsorption, any pricing pressure, bad debt expense, all through our material productivity and cost containment. So we knew it's going to happen. We didn't know when. And I think internally, we were focused on taking costs out. So we'll deal with pricing as it happens. And yes, is it worry? Absolutely, it's a worry. But we are focused on things that we can control and making sure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past when we gave up share because we didn't want to compete on price.

So the biggest move we made in the portfolio this quarter was China, which went up over 5% in terms of units under maintenance. That's the largest growing market for the portfolio. So we've challenged the team to outgrow what they've done in the past in every region, but especially in China."

And in the U.S., while the job sites are open, the number of COVID-19 cases are still rising, and that sometimes impacts the number of people we have available to a job site, on a job site or certain job sites shut down temporarily. So there's a little bit of still fluidity in the market, but this will be counterbalanced by China, to some extent, because we are catching up in certain areas in China, and we do expect China to be strong in Q3. So overall, maybe on the New Equipment side, slight skew towards Q4. And on the Service side, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, our repair activity is still subdued due to the lower building occupancy, some of the buildings are not fully opened yet, and we expect gradual improvement as we go through the year. So on the Service side, we'll definitely have a stronger Q4 than Q3, and that's the higher-margin business. So some of the profit will kind of follow similar trajectory."

So you see early adopters following both the technology early adopter curve, but also we're seeing it earlier in places that have recovered earlier. So China, it's already -- it's being installed. We're seeing good pickup. Where we're seeing on the early adopters in EMEA, the rest of Asia Pac and the Americas, are those building managers who really are trying to figure out how not to queue in the lobbies and how to really create a safe and healthy building environment. And it's early, but we're starting to see -- it's not material in terms of revenue yet, but a lot of people are interested. Some are doing short-term activities, but others are looking at major modernizations.

On the call with me today are Judy Marks, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, except for otherwise noted, the company will speak to results from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and significant nonrecurring items. The company will also refer to adjusted results where adjustments were made as though Otis was a stand-alone company in the current period and the prior year. A reconciliation of these measures can be found in the appendix of the webcast.
We also remind listeners that the presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties, Otis' SEC filings, including our Form 10 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q provide details on the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Judy."

Thanks for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers and shareholders. 
Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics. I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in New equipment, paid down debt and are raising our outlook with rule providing additional details. Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in. And as an example of our ability to continue to execute this quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team, and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt-on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth. Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post-COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to market, and during the quarter, we commissioned an elevator airflow study, examining the risk of airborne transmission and elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science-based safety protocols. 
This study is being led by a Purdue university expert in the spread and prevention of infectious disease through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months. Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting-edge products, we opened a new industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies, such as 3D modeling, custom engineering and real-time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding 4 more countries during this quarter. And the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand, driving service productivity within the organization. In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis One solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. 
Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe and China during the first 9 months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate. Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago, we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building, with over 30 Skyrise and Gen2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compas360 dispatching system, allowing for seamless travel in a 60 story building. In China, Otis was selected to support Tianjin's metro expansion project will add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6 and bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin metro to approximately 1,400 units. This award extends Otis' involvement in infrastructure development in the region. A key strategy for us. And in France, we're helping bring [ lAN deforms ], the business area of Paris to new heights with in order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to the link. The next tallest building in France. 
This project will include Compass Plus, eCall and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers. These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of new equipment share gain during the first 9 months. In terms of liquidity, we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain our revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity, if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter. 
And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered. Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just 3 months, we've begun to make Otis a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter, we enlisted an outside diversity, equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs. 
Later during the quarter, we launched made-to-move communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis' ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work, and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a teller, faster, smarter world. 
Turning to Slide 4, Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA in Asia, partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total o disorders were down approximately 1%. The new equipment backlog continued to grow, up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2%, with the new Equipment segment down 1% and the Service segment down 1.4%. 
Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange. Free cash flow was robust at $311 million with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate and lower net interest costs. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the new Equipment and Service segments declined organically, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency as the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment and favorable transactional effects. Our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year. 
At the same time, we continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the Service segment. Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from Service productivity and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate. Moving to Slide 6. New equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market, and we gained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single digits. Booked margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. 
In the quarter, booked margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New equipment organic sales were down 1%, as mid single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and parts of EMEA. 
At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million, and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of under-absorption, field inefficiencies and an unfavorable mix. Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1%, with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA. 
Service organic sales were down 1.4%, as maintenance demand remains strong, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, a strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions, was about flat. 
Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The Service business was particularly resilient, with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels. 
Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends. 
Turning to Slide 8. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid-single digits and Service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint, reflecting the strong year-to-date performance benefit from an improved sales outlook and higher service productivity. 
At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42. And up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint, driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5%, down 1 point versus the prior outlook. 
Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe. We are improving the Asia outlook, driven by better-than-expected third quarter performance in China. 
However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia. In the Service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly. With the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better-than-expected performance in Asia Pacific. From an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by Level 3 requirements. 
Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint. Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions. That are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic, incremental under absorption of costs and temporary price concessions in the service business. 
This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments. The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional cost to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense and the expected step-up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash. And now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4. 
We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. term loan for Euro Commercial Paper Program. Our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction as we continue to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year. Giving us optionality, depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in '21, after we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment. With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks."

In terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity. We've seen that in China. We've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing it in hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker to have less rory less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running an arrival, and they don't have to actually make that service call.

Can you try and reconcile like what you're seeing financially in your orders in your business? Is it something in the pipeline that you guys all see that is sneaking up on you from a price perspective, it's just going to be a matter of timing? Or is that just, hey, this is COVID, things are flying around where it's uncertain. So we just don't want to make any price promises on price because it just seems like there's a lot more high-level caution around price, but I don't really see it in orders or the numbers.

And we grew our backlog. So every 3%, we're going with 3% up in backlog. So while we're seeing the markets competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you in a place that was most competitive was in North America. 
And -- but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China and a low single digit, we were down in the Americas. So so far, we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grow at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog by growing is really going to feed our '21 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements.

So that's a fairly fairly strong performance given the environment.

And that gives us confidence to grow our New Equipment business. And not have the volume-related headwinds that we've had this year. So it's -- that's kind of our focus for driving New Equipment revenue next year. In terms of markets, I think Judy can comment as well, but the picture is mixed. I mean the fact is we're seeing we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. 
The other markets is a little bit softer, as you would expect. And the projections are a little bit harder. Based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snapback in Asia and in China. And then in Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed, but we'll see where that goes. But what we are focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity. Our proposal activity year-to-date is up double digits. 
And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople, we've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date. Added 700 more channel partners in China. So that is -- that allows us to, even in a down market, increase our proposal activity. And hopefully, that means well for our orders to come."

In the North America, where a lot of our service contracts are as well, we find that those are multiyear. Are the concessions we've given to date had been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days, and they all came in at staggered times. But as long as the building is open, and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that, and that's why we've been able to maintain our service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them, we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the New Equipment side, every now and then a job does cancel. But on the New Equipment side or even on the Service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening. 
Right now, everybody is kind of watching and as long as the building is open or a minimum use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient, and our maintenance has been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful."

And there's not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to protection retention rate as you can get. 
The retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And that was my comment in response to Carter's question on this Otis ONE. Do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not -- the game, 30% to 40% is cumulative. It's not down from Otis ONE, but we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, if the customer gets complete visibility on how they portfolio is performing. They get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down, so we can dispatch the technician. So the uptimes are higher.

We're installing these units at our own cost because we think the productivity benefit outweighs the cost. So that has been our primary focus, but over time, we do expect revenue."

There will there be pressures, as we've discussed previously, yes. But I think the New Equipment markets are behaving, right? China booking margins were up North America was up a little bit of pressure in Asia Pacific, especially in India and Southeast Asia, Asia, as you would expect, a couple of markets in EMEA as well. All that, we put all that in, and it's good to see the booking margin being up and the backlog margin being stable. And I think Judy made a comment on service pricing as well, and it's -- and that's okay as well. I mean, I'll say of these temporary price concessions and these are temporary because we are for a limited period of time outside of East temporary price concessions, the overall service market is holding. Europe was a little bit -- Europe was up. North America was up a little bit pressure in Asia, as you would expect, but Service pricing looks okay as well.

As we pivot to the Americas, I was really pleased with our performance in Latin America. 
We grew share in Brazil, and we are continuing to perform well in Latin America. North America remains very competitive. And we're going to continue to watch that closely. And we've looked -- we gain the same access to the Dodge and the ABI information and Dodge has marginal improvement. But up for next year, and we just have to watch the pace of that deal with what we can control, work our backlog conversion quicker and then drive productivity throughout, especially North America and align our costs with that. 
In South Europe, that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio. And our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the New Equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board, new starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East. But the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China, by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn. The only place we still have constraints in terms of job site access is really in India, which is less than 50% and parts of Southeast Asia. Everywhere else has been restored to the high 90%, and we haven't seen any retreat from that due to the second rebound of coded, either in North America or EMEA."

Thanks for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers and shareholders. Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics. I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in New Equipment, paid down debt and are raising our outlook with Rahul providing additional details. 
Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in, and as an example of our ability to continue to execute, this quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt-on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth.
Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to markets, and during the quarter, we commissioned an elevator airflow study, examining the risk of airborne transmission in elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science-based safety protocols. This study is being led by a Purdue University expert in the spread and prevention of infectious disease through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months. 
Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting-edge products, we opened a new Industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies, such as 3D modeling, custom engineering and real-time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding 4 more countries during this quarter. And the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand, driving service productivity within the organization. 
In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis ONE solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe and China during the first 9 months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate.
Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago, we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building, with over 30 SkyRise and Gen2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compass 360 dispatching system, allowing for seamless travel in a 60-story building.
In China, Otis was selected to support Tianjin's Metro expansion project. We'll add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6, bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin Metro to approximately 1,400 units. This award extends Otis' involvement in infrastructure development in the region, a key strategy for us. 
And in France, we're helping bring La Defense, the business area of Paris to new heights with in order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to The Link, the next tallest building in France. This project will include CompassPlus, eCall and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers.
These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of New Equipment share gain during the first 9 months. In terms of liquidity, we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain our revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity, if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter.
And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered. Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just 3 months, we've begun to make Otis a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter, we enlisted an outside diversity, equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs.
Later during the quarter, we launched Made to Move Communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education, and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis' ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work, and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a teller, faster, smarter world.
Turning to Slide 4. Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia, partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were down approximately 1%. New Equipment backlog continued to grow, up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2%, with the New Equipment segment down 1% and the Service segment down 1.4%. 
Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange. Free cash flow was robust at $311 million, with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. 
While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate and lower net interest costs. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically, pri",1465,"Thank you, Judy, and good morning, everyone. Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency. As the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment and favorable transactional effects, our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume, and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year. 
At the same time, we've continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the Service segment.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from service productivity and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market, and we gained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single digits.
Booked margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. In the quarter, booked margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New Equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were down 1%, as mid-single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and parts of EMEA.
At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million, and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of underabsorption, field inefficiencies and an unfavorable mix. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1%, with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA.
Service organic sales were down 1.4%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, as strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions, was about flat. 
Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion, despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The Service business was particularly resilient, with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels.
Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends. 
Turning to Slide 8. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid-single digits and Service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year, with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint, reflecting the strong year-to-date performance benefit from an improved sales outlook and higher service productivity.
At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42, and up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint, driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5%, down 1 point versus the prior outlook.
Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe.
We are improving the Asia outlook, driven by better-than-expected third quarter performance in China. However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia. In the Service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly, with the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better-than-expected performance in Asia Pacific from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by regulatory requirements. Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions that are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic incremental under absorption of costs and temporary price concessions in the Service business. This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments.
The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional costs to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense and the expected step-up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash. And now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4.
We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. term loan for Euro Commercial Paper program, our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction, as we continue to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, giving us optionality, depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in '21 after we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks."

But in terms of additional subscriptions or revenue, it's still early in terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity. We've seen that in China. We've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing it in hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker to have less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running on arrival, and they don't have to actually make that service call.

So while we're seeing the market's competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you the place that was most competitive was in North America.
And -- but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China and a low single digit we were down in the Americas. so far, we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grow at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog by growing is really going to feed our '21 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements.

So that's not our focus for driving New Equipment revenue next year. 
In terms of markets, I think Judy can comment as well, but the picture is mixed. I mean the fact is we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. The other market is a little bit softer, as you would expect. And the projections are a little bit harder. Based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snapback in Asia and in China. And then -- and Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed, but we'll see where that goes.
But what we are focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity. Our proposal activity year-to-date is up double digits. And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople, we've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date.

It hasn't been material enough to call out, but you would expect that in an environment like this, in the credit environment, you would have incremental bad debt. And we're being appropriately cautious, I would say, on how we are reserving for staff. So if we are seeing things go in the wrong direction, we are providing adequate reserves for that. So bad debt has been with us through the first 9 months. And again, it's not -- it hasn't been material enough to call out each line item, but it cumulatively kind of adds up. So it's okay. 
Pricing, you're right. It hasn't been -- we haven't called it out. As we said, our booked margins are flat -- kind of year-to-date, they're flat. Backlog margins are flat. But again, we are expecting a little bit of conservativeness for Q4, just in case things happen. So you're right. On pricing for New Equipment, that is a common more for Q4, and that does reflect a little bit of conservativeness on our part."

So our Service contracts, our contracts are multiyear in many parts of the world and annual in others. So each country is a little different. We tend to renew our Service contracts in Europe early in the year. And we do have price escalators there that are indexed to inflation. And we'll be watching that as we enter next year as well.
In the North America, where a lot of our Service contracts are as well, we find that those are multiyear. Are -- the concessions we've given to date have been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days, and they all came in at staggered times.
But as long as the building is open, and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that, and that's why we've been able to maintain our Service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them, we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the New Equipment side. Every now and then a job does cancel, but -- on the New Equipment side or even on the Service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening.
Right now, everybody is kind of watching and as long as a building is open or -- at minimum use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient, and our maintenances have been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful."

So you want to be prepared because life is going to be uncertain, at least for the next 3 to 6 months. 
But beyond that, we feel we don't need $1.7 billion, and I think that's what our promise is to get that cash to the shareholders as and when things settle down a little bit. And we do feel that we should be in a position to accelerate our share buyback from '22 into '21.

So we have several connected solutions in addition to Otis ONE. So we have our elevator management system. We provide the destination dispatch.

And there's not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to perfection retention rate as you can get. So the retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And that was my comment in response to Carter's question on Otis ONE. 
Do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not -- again, 30% to 40% is cumulative. So it's not sort of down from Otis ONE, but we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, the customer gets complete visibility on how the portfolio is performing. We get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down, so we can dispatch the technician. So the uptimes are higher. So we do expect, over time, we will get revenue from this, but that has not been our primary focus. We are investing this.

In South Europe, that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio. And our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the New Equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board, new starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East. But the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China, by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn.

Thanks for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers and shareholders. Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics. I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in New Equipment, paid down debt and are raising our outlook with Rahul providing additional details. 
Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in, and as an example of our ability to continue to execute, this quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt-on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth.
Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to markets, and during the quarter, we commissioned an elevator airflow study, examining the risk of airborne transmission in elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science-based safety protocols. This study is being led by a Purdue University expert in the spread and prevention of infectious disease through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months. 
Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting-edge products, we opened a new Industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies, such as 3D modeling, custom engineering and real-time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding 4 more countries during this quarter. And the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand, driving service productivity within the organization. 
In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis ONE solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe and China during the first 9 months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate.
Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago, we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building, with over 30 SkyRise and Gen2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compass 360 dispatching system, allowing for seamless travel in a 60-story building.
In China, Otis was selected to support Tianjin's Metro expansion project. We'll add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6, bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin Metro to approximately 1,400 units. This award extends Otis' involvement in infrastructure development in the region, a key strategy for us. 
And in France, we're helping bring La Defense, the business area of Paris to new heights with in order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to The Link, the next tallest building in France. This project will include CompassPlus, eCall and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers.
These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of New Equipment share gain during the first 9 months. In terms of liquidity, we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain our revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity, if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter.
And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered. Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just 3 months, we've begun to make Otis a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter, we enlisted an outside diversity, equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs.
Later during the quarter, we launched Made to Move Communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education, and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis' ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work, and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a teller, faster, smarter world.
Turning to Slide 4. Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia, partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were down approximately 1%. New Equipment backlog continued to grow, up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2%, with the New Equipment segment down 1% and the Service segment down 1.4%. 
Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange. Free cash flow was robust at $311 million, with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. 
While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate and lower net interest costs. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales.

Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency. As the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment and favorable transactional effects, our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume, and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year. 
At the same time, we've continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the Service segment.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from service productivity and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market, and we gained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single digits.
Booked margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. In the quarter, booked margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New Equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were down 1%, as mid-single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and parts of EMEA.
At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million, and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of underabsorption, field inefficiencies and an unfavorable mix. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1%, with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA.
Service organic sales were down 1.4%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, as strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions, was about flat. 
Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion, despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The Service business was particularly resilient, with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels.
Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends. 
Turning to Slide 8. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid-single digits and Service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year, with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint, reflecting the strong year-to-date performance benefit from an improved sales outlook and higher service productivity.
At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42, and up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint, driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5%, down 1 point versus the prior outlook.
Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe.
We are improving the Asia outlook, driven by better-than-expected third quarter performance in China. However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia. In the Service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly, with the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better-than-expected performance in Asia Pacific from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by regulatory requirements. Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions that are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic incremental under absorption of costs and temporary price concessions in the Service business. This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments.
The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional costs to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense and the expected step-up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash. And now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4.
We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. term loan for Euro Commercial Paper program, our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction, as we continue to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, giving us optionality, depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in '21 after we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks."

But in terms of additional subscriptions or revenue, it's still early in terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity. We've seen that in China. We've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing it in hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker to have less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running on arrival, and they don't have to actually make that service call.

And we grew our backlog. So every 3%, when ordering with 3% up in backlog. So while we're seeing the market's competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you the place that was most competitive was in North America.
And -- but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China and a low single digit we were down in the Americas. so far, we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grow at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog by growing is really going to feed our '21 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements.

So if you look at how we are flat for the quarter, down 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, and obviously, in this environment, the market, we know is down more than 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. And we are down about 2 points year-to-date. So that's a fairly strong performance given the environment. And so based on the analysis that we do, we believe, as Judy said in her prepared remarks that we think we've gained about 70 basis points of share. And that has allowed us to grow our backlog by about 3 points."

And what we want to -- to take it up step further, our next step, obviously, is the fact that we want to accelerate the backlog conversion for '21. And that gives us confidence to grow our New Equipment business and not have the volume-related headwinds that we've had this year. So that's not our focus for driving New Equipment revenue next year. 
In terms of markets, I think Judy can comment as well, but the picture is mixed. I mean the fact is we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. The other market is a little bit softer, as you would expect. And the projections are a little bit harder. Based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snapback in Asia and in China. And then -- and Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed, but we'll see where that goes.
But what we are focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity. Our proposal activity year-to-date is up double digits. And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople, we've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date. Added 700 more channel partners in China. So that is -- that allows us to, even in a down market, increase our proposal activity. And hopefully, that means well for our orders to come."

But good news that we're able to instead of being at $150 million, we are at $130 million for this year, just shows you the focus and the discipline that we have inside the company. In terms of stand-alone costs and separation costs, I think our number is $140 million to $170 million, that's the number we had said, and that's largely between this year and Q1 of next year.

We tend to renew our Service contracts in Europe early in the year. And we do have price escalators there that are indexed to inflation. And we'll be watching that as we enter next year as well.
In the North America, where a lot of our Service contracts are as well, we find that those are multiyear. Are -- the concessions we've given to date have been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days, and they all came in at staggered times.
But as long as the building is open, and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that, and that's why we've been able to maintain our Service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them, we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the New Equipment side. Every now and then a job does cancel, but -- on the New Equipment side or even on the Service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening.
Right now, everybody is kind of watching and as long as a building is open or -- at minimum use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient, and our maintenances have been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful."

We provide the destination dispatch. We have eView systems that",296,"Yes, Denise. So my comment on 30% to -- kind of 30% to 40% was more around the fact. So we have several connected solutions in addition to Otis ONE. So we have our elevator management system. We provide the destination dispatch. We have eView systems that on top of world are -- that are connected. So when you put all that together, that can add about 30% to 40% of the revenue that we get on that unit. And there's not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to perfection retention rate as you can get. So the retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And that was my comment in response to Carter's question on Otis ONE. 
Do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not -- again, 30% to 40% is cumulative. So it's not sort of down from Otis ONE, but we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, the customer gets complete visibility on how the portfolio is performing. We get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down, so we can dispatch the technician. So the uptimes are higher. So we do expect, over time, we will get revenue from this, but that has not been our primary focus. We are investing this. We're installing these units at our own cost because we think the productivity benefit outweighs the cost. So that has been our primary focus, but over time, we do expect revenue."

As we've discussed previously, yes. But I think the New Equipment markets are behaving, right, China booking margins were up. North America was up. A little bit of pressure in Asia Pacific, especially in India and Southeast Asia as you would expect. A couple of markets in EMEA as well. So all that -- we put all that in and it's good to see the booking margin being up and the backlog margin being stable. 
And I think Judy made the comment on Service pricing as well, and it's -- and that's okay as well. I mean, I'll say of these temporary price concessions and these are temporary because we are for a limited period of time outside of these temporary price concessions. The overall service market is holding. Europe was a little bit -- Europe was up. North America was up. A little bit pressure in Asia, as you would expect, but Service pricing looks okay as well. So we feel good about where the environment is.

So our Asia Pacific, although impacted by India and Southeast Asia like the rest of the world, we're really pleased with our share gain there, and we have put some of those sales investments in place there to deal with both the new regulations in Korea, but also just to get more share on the New Equipment side.
As we pivot to the Americas, I was really pleased with our performance in Latin America. We grew share in Brazil, and we are continuing to perform well in Latin America. North America remains very competitive. And we're going to continue to watch that closely. And we've looked -- we gained the same access to the Dodge and the ABI information and Dodge has marginal improvement. But up for next year, and we just have to watch the pace of that deal with what we can control, work our backlog conversion quicker and then drive productivity throughout, especially North America and align our costs with that.
In South Europe, that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio. And our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the New Equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board, new starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East. But the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China, by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn. The only place we still have constraints in terms of job site access is really in India, which is less than 50% and parts of Southeast Asia. Everywhere else has been restored to the high 90%, and we haven't seen any retreat from that due to the second rebound of COVID either in North America or EMEA."

Thanks for joining us, and we hope that everyone listening is safe and well. To start, I want to thank each of our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication as we continue to deliver on our commitments to passengers, customers and shareholders. Overall, as you'll see in our results, our business is trending back towards pre-COVID levels, improving sequentially across all metrics. I'm pleased to share that we had a very strong quarter. We gained share in New Equipment, paid down debt and are raising our outlook with Rahul providing additional details. 
Our strategy is robust despite the unique environment we're in, and as an example of our ability to continue to execute, this quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bay State Elevator, expanding our scale and density in the Northeast United States. We're delighted to have the Bay State colleagues join the Otis team and we remain focused on accelerating growth of the service portfolio, both organically and inorganically. Our bolt-on M&A strategy is working and serves as an accretive source of growth.
Innovation is core to Otis. COVID accelerates the need for new health and safety solutions, which we expect to continue post COVID. Otis is a leader in this space, continuing to bring new products to markets, and during the quarter, we commissioned an elevator airflow study, examining the risk of airborne transmission in elevators and how to best mitigate those risks through science-based safety protocols. This study is being led by a Purdue University expert in the spread and prevention of infectious disease through indoor air systems. We look forward to sharing these findings in the coming months. 
Furthering our ability to provide innovative cutting-edge products, we opened a new Industry 4.0 escalator factory in East China that incorporates intelligent manufacturing, advanced automation, and digital technologies, such as 3D modeling, custom engineering and real-time quality management. This move continues to rationalize our footprint and build on our legacy of excellence while upgrading our smart manufacturing capabilities for a new era. We continue to deploy iPhones to our field professionals, adding 4 more countries during this quarter. And the adoption of our suite of apps continues to expand, driving service productivity within the organization. 
In addition, our IoT deployment continues to build momentum, and we have plans in place to enhance the capability of Otis ONE solutions over the next several months to drive productivity in our organization. Despite the challenges introduced by the pandemic, we continue to deploy these units in the U.S., Europe and China during the first 9 months and expect the pace of deployment to accelerate.
Otis also received several key orders across each of the regions, highlighted on Slide 3. In Chicago, we received an order to outfit the new Salesforce Tower Chicago office building, with over 30 SkyRise and Gen2 elevators. Each of the passenger elevators will have our new innovative Compass 360 dispatching system, allowing for seamless travel in a 60-story building.
In China, Otis was selected to support Tianjin's Metro expansion project. We'll add approximately 120 elevators to Line 6, bringing the total number of Otis elevators and escalators throughout the Tianjin Metro to approximately 1,400 units. This award extends Otis' involvement in infrastructure development in the region, a key strategy for us. 
And in France, we're helping bring La Defense, the business area of Paris to new heights with in order to deliver 60 elevators and several escalators to The Link, the next tallest building in France. This project will include CompassPlus, eCall and OptiSense technologies, creating a faster, safer and more seamless trip for the passengers.
These are just a handful of examples that led to the approximate 70 basis points of New Equipment share gain during the first 9 months. In terms of liquidity, we ended Q3 with $1.7 billion of cash and continue to maintain our revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop for our commercial paper issuances and an additional source of liquidity, if needed. We also made progress on our debt repayment goal of $350 million in 2020, repaying $250 million in the quarter.
And as we remain dedicated to delivering results for our customers and shareholders, our commitment to global corporate citizenship has not wavered. Last quarter, I shared with you the launch of our commitment to change. In just 3 months, we've begun to make Otis a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture and identify and prioritize actions we need to take to get there. For example, in the quarter, we enlisted an outside diversity, equity and inclusion expert to independently assess our practices and provide recommendations to guide future decisions and programs.
Later during the quarter, we launched Made to Move Communities, a CSR program focused on advancing youth STEM education, and providing inclusive mobility solutions for communities in need. This extends Otis' ongoing commitment to the communities where we live and work, and we look forward to providing the avenue and resources to help young minds explore new ways to give people freedom to connect and thrive in a teller, faster, smarter world.
Turning to Slide 4. Q3 results and 2020 outlook. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency with low single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia, partially offset by low single-digit decline in the Americas. China orders were up high single digits as the business continued its rapid recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. On a rolling 12 months, total Otis orders were down approximately 1%. New Equipment backlog continued to grow, up 3% versus the prior year at constant currency. In the third quarter, organic sales were down 1.2%, with the New Equipment segment down 1% and the Service segment down 1.4%. 
Adjusted operating profit was up $33 million and margin expanded 120 basis points, driven by continued expansion in the Service segment on strong contribution from productivity and the benefit from cost containment actions and favorable transactional foreign exchange. Free cash flow was robust at $311 million, with 117% conversion of GAAP net income. 
While there remains uncertainty around the global recovery from the pandemic, we are encouraged by these strong year-to-date results and the trends we're experiencing, giving us confidence to revise our 2020 outlook. We are improving the organic sales range, now expected to be down 2% to 3%. Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be in the range of up $30 million to $40 million, a $60 million improvement versus the prior outlook at the midpoint. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $2.42, up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint. This reflects our improved adjusted operating profit outlook, lower adjusted tax rate and lower net interest costs. 
Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be robust at approximately $1.15 billion with full year free cash flow conversion at approximately 135% of GAAP net income.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rahul to walk through our results and outlook in more detail."

Starting with third quarter results on Slide 5. Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales.

Net sales were $3.3 billion, down 1.4% with a 1.2% decline in organic sales. As anticipated, both the New Equipment and Service segments declined organically, primarily from the impact of COVID-19. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter was up approximately 7% or $33 million and up $30 million at constant currency. As the impact of lower volume, temporary price concessions and field inefficiencies was more than offset by strong productivity, cost containment and favorable transactional effects, our focus on reducing material cost continues to yield results and maintenance hours per unit sustained a downward trajectory. Cost containment efforts that we launched in Q1 of 2020 also helped alleviate the pressure from lower volume, and year-to-date SG&A expense was down by more than $60 million year-over-year. 
At the same time, we've continued to invest in the business and R&D expense as a percentage of sales was about flat versus the prior year. Our strong focus on operational execution drove 120 basis points of adjusted margin expansion with continued margin improvement in the Service segment.
Third quarter adjusted EPS was up 25% or $0.14 from $0.06 of operating profit growth and the balance from a lower adjusted tax rate and a drop in interest costs. These results were better than we had expected in the previous outlook, driven by the stability of the maintenance business, higher savings from service productivity and progress on reducing the adjusted tax rate. 
Moving to Slide 6. New Equipment orders were up slightly at constant currency and were down approximately 1% on a rolling 12-month basis. Order intake continues to outperform the market, and we gained approximately 40 basis points of share in the third quarter in a market that was down low single digits.
Booked margins were up slightly in the quarter and were flat year-to-date versus the prior year. In the quarter, booked margin improvement in China and North America was partially offset by pressure in parts of Asia Pacific and EMEA. New Equipment backlog was up 3% at constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas, with overall backlog margin improving slightly from Q2 and remaining stable versus the prior year. New Equipment organic sales were down 1%, as mid-single-digit growth in China was more than offset by declines in Asia Pacific and parts of EMEA.
At constant currency, New Equipment adjusted operating profit was down $9 million, and margin contracted 50 basis points as strong material productivity and cost containment was more than offset by the impact of underabsorption, field inefficiencies and an unfavorable mix. 
Service segment results on Slide 7 remained strong in the quarter. Number of units under maintenance contracts increased by over 1%, with growth in all major regions and China up more than 6%. Modernization orders were down 7.3% at constant currency as double-digit growth in Asia, driven by the mandated regulatory upgrades in certain markets was more than offset by lower order intake in the Americas and EMEA.
Service organic sales were down 1.4%, as maintenance demand remained strong, while discretionary repair and modernization projects were pushed out. At constant currency, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points and profit grew $19 million, as strong contribution from productivity and cost containment actions more than offset the impact from volume decline, temporary price concessions and an increase in bad debt expense. The service pricing environment, excluding the impact of these price concessions, was about flat. 
Overall, year-to-date results reflect solid performance with $33 million of adjusted profit growth at constant currency and 90 basis points of margin expansion, despite organic sales being down 3.3% versus the prior year. The Service business was particularly resilient, with adjusted operating profit growth of $47 million at constant currency on a slight decline in organic sales in an extremely challenging market environment. Also, third quarter results reflect sequential improvement in both segments and steady progress towards returning to pre-COVID levels.
Access to job sites and buildings has largely returned to normal outside of India and Southeast Asia, and the service call volume is back to 2019 levels in China and Asia Pacific. And the trends are heading in the right direction in Europe and Americas. We are improving our 2020 outlook to reflect strong progress during the year and these encouraging trends. 
Turning to Slide 8. We now expect overall organic sales to be down 2% to 3% for the year, up from prior expectations of down 2% to 4%, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments. We now expect New Equipment sales to be down mid-single digits and Service sales to be flat to down slightly. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $30 million to $40 million at constant currency for the year, with 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion. This is an improvement of $60 million versus the prior outlook at midpoint, reflecting the strong year-to-date performance benefit from an improved sales outlook and higher service productivity.
At actual currency, adjusted operating profit is expected to be up $5 million to $15 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange trends in addition to the operational improvement. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be up 8% versus the prior year to approximately $2.42, and up $0.17 versus the prior midpoint, driven by an improved operating profit outlook, lower net interest costs and a reduced tax rate. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the year to be about 30.5%, down 1 point versus the prior outlook.
Taking a further look at the organic growth assumptions on Slide 9. In the New Equipment segment, Americas is now expected to be down mid-single digits, reflecting strong recovery in the third quarter with sequential improvement and year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. EMEA is now expected to be down mid- to high single digits, reflecting a strong recovery in Northern and Eastern Europe.
We are improving the Asia outlook, driven by better-than-expected third quarter performance in China. However, we expect Asia to be down in the fourth quarter due to continuing challenges in India and Southeast Asia. In the Service segment, we expect the maintenance and repair business to be flat to down slightly, with the maintenance sales remaining resilient and a slower recovery in discretionary repairs. We are raising the modernization outlook to be about flat for the year, driven by better-than-expected performance in Asia Pacific from an effective go-to-market strategy to tap into the demand created by regulatory requirements. Overall, the outlook of 2% to 3% organic sales decline reflects sequential improvement and return to pre-COVID levels in the fourth quarter at the midpoint.
Switching to operating profit on Slide 10. At constant currency, operating profit is now expected to be up $30 million to $40 million versus the prior year, reflecting the benefit of solid contribution from materials and service productivity and cost containment actions that are more than offsetting the impact of reduced volume from the COVID-19 pandemic incremental under absorption of costs and temporary price concessions in the Service business. This represents a $60 million improvement versus the prior expectations, with improvement in both New Equipment and Service segments.
The fourth quarter outlook includes incremental investments in the new equipment and service sales channel in China, additional costs to complete the maintenance visits, sequentially higher R&D expense and the expected step-up in public company costs. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a headwind of approximately $25 million, an improvement from a headwind of $40 million to $50 million that we had expected in July, primarily due to strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 
An update on capital deployment on Slide 11. We started 2020 with about $1.4 billion of cash. And now expect to generate approximately $1.15 billion of free cash flow in 2020, an improvement of $100 million versus the prior midpoint from higher net income and an improved working capital performance. As Judy mentioned, we repaid $250 million of debt in the quarter with another $100 million of repayment planned for Q4.
We also refinanced $500 million of the U.S. term loan for Euro Commercial Paper program, our first foreign currency denominated debt transaction, as we continue to evaluate our capital structure. We still expect to return $260 million to shareholders through dividends in Q2 through Q4 and spent approximately $200 million between noncontrolling interest and M&A. These actions will allow us to maintain sufficient liquidity and position us to increase cash on the balance sheet by the end of the year, giving us optionality, depending on the overall liquidity conditions to start share buyback in '21 after we complete the previously disclosed $500 million of debt repayment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Judy for closing remarks."

But in terms of additional subscriptions or revenue, it's still early in terms of where we're able to gain traction on that. It's certainly adding value and productivity. We've seen that in China. We've seen it in Spain, and we're now seeing it in hearing from our mechanics in North America in terms of how it's giving them the ability to show up quicker to have less running on arrivals when they get there because they know it's already running on arrival, and they don't have to actually make that service call.

So while we're seeing the market's competitive, pricing was competitive in the third quarter, we would tell you the place that was most competitive was in North America.
And -- but we are seeing -- we had low single-digit gains in terms of EMEA and Asia, high single-digit gains in China and a low single digit we were down in the Americas. so far, we're dealing with what we can control, which is winning the business, growing the share. We grow at about 40 basis points and then executing on that backlog by driving as much productivity and cost control as we can. And this backlog by growing is really going to feed our '21 and put us in a pretty good position there. So we were pleased with what we saw Q3 versus Q2 and all the sequential improvements.

And again, we do -- this is the story that we've been saying since our kind of Investor Day that we do expect tough pricing environment.
We've expected it. Obviously, the macroeconomic conditions are not great.

So that's not our focus for driving New Equipment revenue next year. 
In terms of markets, I think Judy can comment as well, but the picture is mixed. I mean the fact is we are seeing a sharp bounce back in China. The other market is a little bit softer, as you would expect. And the projections are a little bit harder. Based on the data we are seeing, there's a little bit of a snapback in Asia and in China. And then -- and Europe looks okay as well. North America is a little bit more mixed, but we'll see where that goes.
But what we are focused on is kind of driving what we can control. And the other point I want to make up is our proposal activity. Our proposal activity year-to-date is up double digits. And that goes to all the things that we've been saying we are going to do in terms of expanding our sales coverage, adding more salespeople, we've added more than 100 salespeople year-to-date.

And so we'll continue and provide more color and more guidance as we talk about 2021. But typically, what you see is 2/3 of the revenue for next year coming from backlog."

And we're being appropriately cautious, I would say, on how we are reserving for staff. So if we are seeing things go in the wrong direction, we are providing adequate reserves for that. So bad debt has been with us through the first 9 months. And again, it's not -- it hasn't been material enough to call out each line item, but it cumulatively kind of adds up. So it's okay. 
Pricing, you're right. It hasn't been -- we haven't called it out. As we said, our booked margins are flat -- kind of year-to-date, they're flat. Backlog margins are flat. But again, we are expecting a little bit of conservativeness for Q4, just in case things happen. So you're right. On pricing for New Equipment, that is a common more for Q4, and that does reflect a little bit of conservativeness on our part."

So our Service contracts, our contracts are multiyear in many parts of the world and annual in others. So each country is a little different. We tend to renew our Service contracts in Europe early in the year. And we do have price escalators there that are indexed to inflation. And we'll be watching that as we enter next year as well.
In the North America, where a lot of our Service contracts are as well, we find that those are multiyear. Are -- the concessions we've given to date have been pretty limited to the hospitality and retail industry only. And as we've shared with our end market exposure, that's a little under 10% for us globally. And those concessions to date have lasted typically for about 90 days, and they all came in at staggered times.
But as long as the building is open, and it's important to note, John, that we also match our cost when those concessions go in terms of the services we deliver. So we've been doing a good job in that, and that's why we've been able to maintain our Service margins and our margin expansion. As these come up for renewal, every one of them, we discuss with the customers exactly what types of services they need to receive and then we adjust our costs accordingly. But we have not seen any unusual cancellations on either the New Equipment side. Every now and then a job does cancel, but -- on the New Equipment side or even on the Service side, we've not seen extreme cancellations happening.
Right now, everybody is kind of watching and as long as a building is open or -- at minimum use and all the residential buildings are at significant use, we are out there providing maintenance. Our maintenance pricing has held up very resilient, and our maintenances have been very resilient. And really, it's the discretionary repair and modernization where we've had any of the decline in sales as people are making discretionary choices. I hope that was helpful."

But beyond that, we feel we don't need $1.7 billion, and I think that's what our promise is to get that cash to the shareholders as and when things settle down a little bit.

And there's not a lot of incremental cost to support that. So you would expect margins to be higher in addition to almost close to -- as close to perfection retention rate as you can get. So the retention rates are very, very high. So there are lots of incremental benefits. And that was my comment in response to Carter's question on Otis ONE. 
Do you expect incremental revenue from that? Yes, we do. It's not -- again, 30% to 40% is cumulative. So it's not sort of down from Otis ONE, but we do expect incremental revenue because at the end of the day, the customer gets complete visibility on how the portfolio is performing. We get higher uptime because as Judy responded earlier, we can dispatch a technician as soon as the unit breaks down. So we know before the customer calls us, we know the unit is down, so we can dispatch the technician. So the uptimes are higher. So we do expect, over time, we will get revenue from this, but that has not been our primary focus. We are investing this.

In South Europe, that is the heart of our maintenance portfolio. And our teams have done a great job aligning cost with the service we're providing and really having minimal concessions. So on the New Equipment side, we think we're seeing new starts in Europe, including in South Europe, and we're seeing it really across the board, new starts in EMEA, a little slower in the Middle East. But the Asian economies are turning the corner, led by China, by far. But the rest of the Asian economies are starting to turn.
